4129545,135484,Latimeria menadoensis,Vulnerable,C2a(ii); D2,2008,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Latimeria menadoensis</em> is only known from three locations in northern Sulawesi, Indonesia and very few specimens have been seen. It is thought to be naturally rare with a population of less than 10,000 mature adults. This is a slow growing species with low fecundity, and therefore is naturally susceptible to over-exploitation. Major threats are bycatch in deep set shark nets and hook and line fishing for deepwater groupers. There is no population information available and nothing is known about current trends. Due to small number of localities known, and the life history, suspected low population size, and threats from bycatch, <em>Latimeria menadoensis</em> is listed as Vulnerable under criteria D2 and C2a (ii).","This is a demersal, non-migratory marine species found in deep water between 150-200m depth. It lives in water temperatures from 17-20°C. It is presumably found in rocky slopes and caves. Fricke <em>et al</em>. (2000) observed two specimens of 120 and 140 cm length in a deep carbonate cave at a depth of 155 m (water temp. 17.8-20.1°C).  <em>Latimeria menadoensis</em> is presumed to be very slow growing and long lived, with very low fecundity (maximum of around 50 for congeneric species), similar to sharks. Females produce large, orange-sized eggs which hatch within the oviduct before the female gives birth to live young. The autopsy of the Sulawesi Coelacanth that was caught in May 2007 in Bunaken National Marine Park, showed that in fact the fish was pregnant. Scientists in Indonesia, France and Japan are currently conducting research to better understand the reproductive biology of this fish.<br/><br/>Though scientists have never observed coelacanths feeding in their natural habitat, analyses of stomach contents of captured specimens have shown that their diet includes cuttlefish, squid, and various small to medium-sized benthic fishes – including lantern fishes, cardinal fishes and deepwater snappers.<br/><br/>Coelacanths can weigh up to 100 kg, though an average size is closer 30 kg.They may live to an age of at least 22 years.<br/><br/>There are many unanswered questions about the ecology of <em>Latimeria manadoensis</em>.<br/><br/>A unique combination of morphological features suggest that the coelacanth lineage is close to the origin of the evolution of early terrestrial, four-legged animals (tetrapods) like amphibians. The most remarkable of these features is the presence of seven lobed fins, unique among the living fishes. The paired fins move in an alternating fashion which resembles a horse in a slow trot. Other interesting features include a small secondary ""epicaudal"" lobe on its tail, an oil-filled notochord instead of a backbone, an intercranial joint which is thought to allow them to widen their gape when capturing prey, and a unique electrosensory rostral organ that may be used to detect prey. While their morphological features lead many scientists to believe the coelacanth lineage was the direct link to tetrapods, recent molecular evidence suggests that lung fish might be more closely related to tetrapods (University of California Museum of Paleontology, website).","<em>Latimeria menadoensis</em> has a very low population size and its life history makes it a species with higher extinction risk due to slow growth and low fecundity. This is not a commercial species and has no food value, but is caught as bycatch by deep shark nets and by hook and line targeting deepwater snapper.<br/><br/>This species is an extremely sought after aquarium fish, although no specimen has ever been successfully kept alive for aquarium display.","The population status of this species is unknown. It is believed to be a naturally small population (suspected to be less than 10,000 mature adults) and rare. A population study has never been undertaken and the species is very rarely caught by fisherman. One experienced fisherman informed that during his life as a fisherman this species was caught no more than 30 times, or not more than one or two times per year (M. Erdmann pers. comm.). The growth of its population is likely to be very slow, similar to <em>Latimeria chalumnae</em>. The shark fishermen at Menado Tua Island generally catch 1-2 individuals of <em>L. menadoensis</em> once every 5-10 years as bycatch (Erdmann and Kasim Moosa, pers. comm.). In northern Sulawesi, all fishermen are aware of this species and would report it if caught.",Unknown,"This species is known from the Celebes Sea, north of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It is only known only from three localities.  The first two specimins were caught on Manado Tua in September 1997 and July, 1998.  Another was caught in Manado Bay in May, 2007. The third site is northern Suluwesi near Dondo Bay, slightly to the east on Tanjum Kandi.  The animal from the Dondo Bay site was observed in the Jago submersible in November 1999.

In Lake Victoria it is found in the open lake and in the dense interior of swamps and marshes (Goudswaard&#160;<em>et al. </em>2002) and in the Lake Tanganyika basin near rivers and deltas (Eccles 1992). Juveniles are found in the matted roots of papyrus (Witte and de Winter 1995). It can also live in streams and swamps which are completely dry for long periods of the year (Lockley 1949). It withstands desiccation by aestivating in cocoons until the next rains, breathing air by a small passage leading to the outside (Lockley 1949). The subspecies <em>Protopterus aethiopicus&#160;</em><em>congicus </em>is fluviatile and is confined to calm places with a muddy bottom. The principal diet of adults and sub-adults consists of molluscs but small fishes and insects are also eaten in small quantities. This species breeds during the flood season (Bailey 1994). One or several females spawn in burrows, which are dug and cleaned by the male who later guards the eggs and the young for nearly eight weeks (Witte and de Winter 1995).Young individuals of less than 35 cm TL feed almost wholly on insects (Witte and de Winter 1995). The maximum size is 200 cm TL, but they are commonly around 130 cm TL (Van Oijen 1995).","In the Lake Victoria basin the main threats are large-scale conversion of wetlands to agricultural land, harvesting of nest-guarding males, local overexploitation and low levels of Nile Perch predation restricting Lungfish to wetland refugia (Goudswaard&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2002).&#160;Sedimentation and the increased use of agrochemicals (pesticides and fertilisers) as a result of agricultural expansion are threats in the Malagarazi and Rusizi River basins.&#160;Mining activities and land-based pollution are additional threats in this region.&#160;It is also collected for the aquarium trade, although this may have a negligible impact on the population compared to other threats.<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Protopterusaethiopicus mesmaekersi </em>may be threatened by transport and oil disposal by boats as well as intensive local fishing activities.

Within each catchment Lungfish can be found in tributary streams, the river channel, and impounded river sections. Lungfish breeding grounds, nursery areas and adult foraging areas share similar habitat features and frequently coincide or overlap. All three are unified by the presence of submerged aquatic plants (macrophytes) (Kind 2002) and riverine conditions (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Lungfish breeding predominantly occurs in shallow river margins where eggs are laid between August and December amongst dense beds of submerged macrophytes (Brooks and Kind 2002). Suitable breeding habitat is often widespread during this period after low, stable winter flows have provided opportunities for aquatic plant communities to flourish. Espinoza <em>et al</em>. (2013) have also demonstrated variability in the low flow regime may be important for triggering spawning. Lungfish breeding habitat is also highly susceptible to flow changes and current evidence from the Burnett River suggests that breeding rarely in occurs in the deep, steep-sided pools created by dams and weirs (Brooks and Kind 2002). Lungfish breeding has been observed in the shallow margins of impoundments, but closer inspection of egg viability shows a large proportion are unviable eggs and recruitment is likely to be much lower than in riverine habitats (Roberts&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014)</p>  <p>Juvenile Lungfish exhibit an affinity for complex instream habitat. Records of juveniles collected in the field have typically been taken from dense cover in water &lt; 300 mm deep (Brooks and Kind 2002). Adult Lungfish also congregate in patches of complex underwater habitat, most often in submerged macrophyte beds or underneath partially submerged riparian vegetation (Kemp 1995, Kind 2002). Woody debris, undercut banks, and rocks provide alternative shelter sites in heavily populated reaches (Brooks and Kind 2002, Kind 2002).</p>  <p><br/></p>","<p>Man-made barriers to Lungfish movement such as dams, weirs and culverts are common throughout the distribution of <em>N. forsteri</em>. Only a small proportion of these barriers are fitted with fishways capable of passing lungfish. Australian Lungfish have highly specialized spawning requirements characterized by shallow water and submerged aquatic vegetation. Barriers to fish movement prevent natural flow regimes, access to suitable spawning habitat, and restrict the potential for gene flow within catchments. Waterway infrastructure such as dams and weirs may also be causing physical damage to lungfish as they are known to move over impoundment walls during overtopping flow events (Kind 2002, Brooks and Kind 2002, Stuart and Berghuis 2002). The extent of damage to these individuals is unknown. Tidal barrages that divide fresh and saline water also lead to stranding of lungfish in estuarine waters and other isolated river sections. Marine stranding is a common occurrence in the Burnett River (Brooks and Kind 2002, Stuart and Berghuis 2002), Mary River (Berghuis 2001), Enoggera Creek (Kemp 1986) and the North Pine River (S.Brooks unpub. data 2018). Lungfish are intolerant of elevated salinity and rarely survive in this situation. There is also evidence that lungfish accumulating at the base of barriers to fish passage remain there for long periods, leading to a decline in condition and finally death (S.Brooks unpub. data 2018).</p>  <p>Natural flow regimes within the distribution of Australian Lungfish have been significantly altered by water regulation. Numerous dams and weirs have been built, particularly within the Burnett, Mary and Brisbane catchments. The construction and operation of water storage infrastructure, has altered the volume, frequency, duration and timing (seasonality) of riverine flows, including no flow periods. Permanently flooded and fluctuating water levels make it difficult for macrophytes to establish within impounded areas (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2015). Altered flow can also significantly impact on growth and condition of macrophyte beds downstream of barriers. There is evidence that flow regulation has led to increased fluctuations in water level, reduced volumes of water in river channels and therefore reduced habitat for fish, stranding of adult lungfish, exposure of breeding habitat including eggs and inundation of habitat leading to reduced habitat availability and changes in Lungfish movement patterns. Impediment of natural flow regimes has also been demonstrated to potentially affect spawning and recruitment success for this species (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2013).  Present water allocations in the Burnett River have occasionally resulted in the stranding of lungfish in drying pools (G.Green pers. comm. 2001).&#160; It is not known whether any Lungfish are physically extracted from the river or injured by pumps, however, this is known to occur in other catchments such as the Murray-Darling Basin where significant losses of native fish have been documented.</p>  <p>Juvenile and adult rely on complex underwater habitat, predominately macrophyte beds, woody debris and undercut banks for foraging and shelter (Kemp 1986, Kind 2002, Brooks and Kind 2002). Degradation of this habitat can occur via numerous causes including livestock trampling, desnagging, erosion, increased sedimentation and land clearing. Livestock watering is widespread throughout the distribution of lungfish. Livestock drinking in the shallows have been observed trampling Lungfish eggs and breeding habitat (S.Brooks unpub. data 2018). Reduced habitat availability is likely to expose juvenile Lungfish to increased predation.</p>  <p>Lungfish also have highly specialized breeding requirements incorporating shallow waters with dense macrophyte cover. The construction of water storage infrastructure has resulted in the loss of breeding habitat and current evidence suggests that habitat within impoundments is sub-optimal for Lungfish breeding (Brooks and Kind 2002, Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2015). Loss of breeding habitat has the potential to impact on recruitment levels and the capacity for Lungfish to increase in numbers. The Burnett River is one of the most developed river catchments and in  2003 there was an estimated 26% loss in spawning and nursery habitat  (Environment Australia 2003), this loss has increased further with the completion of Paradise Dam.<br/></p>  <p>Brooks and Kind (2002) suggested that loss of spawning habitat and infrequent spawning in impounded waters may lead to overcrowding in the remaining breeding grounds. Overcrowding may lead to a number of negative impacts on Lungfish including increased stress, damage to eggs, increased predation on eggs and juveniles, and increased competition between hatched juveniles.</p>  <p>A reduction in water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, salinity and waterborne toxins can negatively impact on Lungfish growth and egg development. Increased salinity is an issue for many inland river catchments and the Burnett and Mary Rivers have been identified in the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality as one of the 21 areas most affected by salinity and water quality problems in Australia. Increased salinity could have major effects on Lungfish due to their intolerance for saline conditions. The sub-lethal impacts of salinity and effects of salinity on early stages of Lungfish life-history are poorly understood and increasing river salinity could therefore be expected to have a detrimental effect on lungfish populations.</p>  <p>Increased sedimentation and turbidity due to erosion and runoff can affect river productivity and thereby reduce macrophyte growth that is important breeding habitat for lungfish. Increased suspended particles can lead to smothering of eggs and substrates essential for spawning, refuge and feeding. Observational data suggests that no eggs are found on macrophytes that are covered in fine sediment (S. Brooks pers comm. 2018).</p><p>  </p><p>Large flood events have been found to remove shallow macrophytes beds and the underlying root structure and seed stock resulting in periods of little or no spawning habitat for multiple seasons until recovery occurs. Using the record 2013 flood in the Burnett as an example, dense macrophytes have not been observed in the river at suitable densities as of early 2019. Similar loss of macrophytes for several years has been observed in the Brisbane River. Further compounding this threat is the potential loss of propagules supplied form upstream river reaches that are retained in large impoundments, slowing the natural recovery rate downstream of major impoundment. </p>  <p></p>  <p>Native fish have been stocked widely throughout the distribution of <em>N. forsteri</em> to enhance recreational fishing opportunities (Hollaway and Hamlyn 2001). In most areas, stocking occurs annually. The main stocked species include Australian Bass, Golden Perch, Saratoga, Silver Perch and Barramundi. The impacts of stocked fish on lungfish are poorly understood. Many stocked species are highly predatory and may prey on juvenile lungfish or eggs. However, there is no conclusive evidence to demonstrate the extent of this threat. Introduced species also increase the threat of competition for food and habitat or disturbance to spawning habitat and spread of disease and parasites.</p>  <p>The noxious pest fish <em>Oreochromis mossambicus</em> (a species of tilapia) occurs widely in the Brisbane River Catchment, where it coexists with Lungfish. The species has also established in Boondooma Dam within the Burnett River Catchment. Tilapias are highly invasive species that disturb macrophyte beds when making their nests, which could reduce the availability of suitable Lungfish breeding habitat. However, no evidence is currently available to confirm negative impacts of tilapia on Lungfish populations. The noxious European carp <em>Cyprinus carpio</em> is also widespread in parts of Queensland, but has not yet established any populations within the distribution of <em>N. forsteri</em>.</p>  <p>Noxious aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth, salvinia and Cabomba and others are already present within the distribution of <em>N. forsteri</em> and widespread in some sections. Floating weeds cover the water surface, leading to reduced temperature and oxygen levels in the water below, inhibiting the growth of submerged plants used for spawning by lungfish. Likewise, submerged weeds with dense growth forms such as Cabomba and Dense Water Weed are not suited to lungfish spawning. Limited weed removal programs are currently in place throughout the distribution on <em>N. forsteri</em>.</p>  <p>Lungfish are listed as a ‘no take’ species under the Fisheries Act 1994. Despite this status, fishing competition data and other reports confirm that incidental capture of lungfish occurs in the recreational fishery. Interviews with local residents indicate that some lungfish are still taken illegally for human consumption or for use as pet food. Discarded Lungfish carcasses have been found on river banks at popular angling sites (Kind 2002, S. Brooks unpub. data 2018). No data are currently available on the post-release survival rate of Lungfish taken by recreational anglers. The extent of illegal take has not been quantified. The use of funnel/opera house traps and ‘shrimp rakes’ is also widespread within the distribution of <em>N. forsteri</em>. Both these bait collection methods are likely to disturb aquatic plants necessary for Lungfish breeding.</p>  Lungfish deaths from boat strike have been observed in the lower reaches of the Burnett and Mary Rivers (S.Brooks unpub. data 2018). This artificially increases adult mortality rates. The extent of mortality from this occurrence is poorly understood. A low genetic diversity, long generation time and low juvenile survival may increase the effects of these threats (Frentiu <em>et al</em>. 2001).","A recent 10 year monitoring program on the Burnett River indicates that adult Lungfish remain common with no evidence of decline or change in the structure of Lungfish populations at the sites sampled (Kind <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Results of this monitoring were supported by an independent review of the data (Fanson and Todd 2017). <a style=""mso-comment-reference: ET_1;mso-comment-date:20190208T1436"">This monitoring also found little evidence of recruitment to the population in the final 6 years of the project</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> , however, tag-recapture data indicated fish movement over water infrastructure is resulting in a net downstream redistribution of the population.   <p>The Mary River is one of the last largely unregulated rivers remaining in SE Queensland. Lungfish remain common within the Mary with less impact by river regulation then other populations. The population structure within the Mary River is discrete from the Burnett River by the presence of smaller fish (S. Brooks unpub. <a style=""mso-comment-reference:BSG_2;mso-comment-date: 20190130T1354"">data</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> 2018). Juvenile lungfish (&lt; 600 mm) have been more recently sampled from Tinana and Obi Obi creeks (T. Espinoza unpub. data 2018) suggesting suitable environmental conditions for spawning and recruitment in these sub-catchments.</p>  <p>The <a style=""mso-comment-reference:BSG_3; mso-comment-date:20190130T1356"">Brisbane </a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">River population is essentially divided into three sub regions due to the barrier effects of Wivenhoe Dam on the Brisbane River and Somerset Dam on the Stanley River. The upper reaches of the Brisbane and Stanley Rivers contain reasonable numbers of lungfish but very few surveys have been undertaken to compare abundance and status. Both sections of river contain suitable habitats for spawning and adult refuge and periodic inspections find evidence of eggs when macrophyte beds are present. Downstream of Wivenhoe Dam lungfish are common. Recent research has shown that the population in the lower Brisbane River has the highest catch per unit effort catch rates out all sub-populations formally surveyed and comprises a wide range of body sizes. Regular recruitment to the adult populations was confirmed through ageing studies (Fallon&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2019) </span></p>  <p>The North Pine River population seemed relatively abundant and considered common. There is little evidence of recruitment to this population with the majority of fish being larger adults and rarely are fish observed below 700 mm.</p>  <p>Lungfish populations within the Condamine and Coomera Rivers are little known. Reports of lungfish within the Condamine are rare and uncommon despite considerable fishery sampling within this area for other purposes. It is considered that this population has never effectively established and consists of very few fish. The Coomera River holds a small but diverse population of lungfish. This population is limited by suitable habitat (S. Brooks unpub. <a style=""mso-comment-reference:BSG_2;mso-comment-date: 20190130T1354"">data</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> 2018). </p>  <p>Increasing levels of water regulation have also impacted on recruitment. It is unlikely that the impounded waters of weirs and dams represent suitable habitat for successful lungfish spawning and recruitment (Brooks and Kind 2002, Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2015, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2014, Kind <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p></span>",Stable,"This Australian endemic is native to the Burnett and Mary rivers in southeast Queensland, and has been translocated elsewhere. Fossil evidence demonstrates that the distribution of <em>N. forsteri</em> has contracted over time (De Vis 1885). While fossil material has been collected from Lightning Ridge, New South Wales (Kemp and Molnar 1981), and Chinchilla in Queensland (Kemp 1982a), the present distribution is confined to southeast Queensland. When described, the species inhabited only the Mary and Burnett Rivers (De Vis 1885, Illidge 1893). In the latter part of the 1800s, biologists feared that <em>N. forsteri</em> was in danger of extinction due to an apparent lack of juvenile fish. To rectify this ‘problem’ the Royal Society of Queensland commissioned Mr. D. O’Connor (1897) to translocate 69 adult fish from the Mary River at Miva to various waterways further south. These included the North Pine River, Albert River, upper Brisbane River (Cressbrook Ck), Enoggera Reservoir, Condamine River, Coomera River and the Brisbane Botanic Gardens (O’Connor 1897). Lungfish currently occur in the Burnett (including tributaries), Mary (including tributaries), North Pine, Brisbane, Logan and Coomera Rivers, as well as Enoggera and Gold Creek Reservoirs, Lake Manchester and the Condamine River west of the Great Dividing Range (Kemp 1995).","<p>This species is a 'no take' species in Queensland so cannot legally be fished. However interviews with local residents indicate that some Lungfish are still taken illegally for human consumption or for use as pet food. Discarded lungfish carcasses have been found on river banks at popular angling sites (Kind 2002, DAF unpub. data 2018).</p>  <p>In 1975 this species was listed under CITES due to perceived threats from collection and smuggling to satisfy the demands of the international aquarium trade. In order to reduce this pressure, three aquaculture licenses were issued in 1999 with limited numbers of broodstock. One of these facilities developed techniques to breed the fish, and commenced exporting soon after.</p>  Five aquaculture facilities in Queensland are now currently licensed to produce Lungfish for the aquarium trade. Broodstock collection is controlled using general fisheries permits and limited in numbers. Presently only two operators hold permits to collect broodstock.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species has a federal conservation status of vulnerable, and is listed as appendix 2 on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (McGouther 2017). This species is listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, threatened under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992, and a 'no-take' species under Queensland Fisheries Act 1994 (Clement <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>There is currently no official recovery plan, however a draft recovery plan has been produced and is awaiting approval (https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/1c97db3a-e828-4e1f-9822-7c8c5a7e3bdc/files/draft-recovery-plan-australian-lungfish.pdf). <br/><br/>Monitoring of Lungfish in the Burnett River has continued through the funding of water regulators as part of the conditions of approval and operation of large water infrastructure. This monitoring has included fishway monitoring and Lungfish movement associated with these, population studies and monitoring of spawning activity.<p>DNRME also has an established monitoring programs for Lungfish spawning in the Burnett River involving confirmation monitoring for environmental releases from key infrastructure in the catchment. DNRME is also trialling in collaboration with the water service providers macrophyte transplanting from less flood-affected areas into suitable spawning grounds to aid recovery of macrophyte losses due to large flood events.</p><p>The numbers of Lungfish mortalities and stranding at dams and weirs has been reduced with the modification of the spill ways and plunge pools and implementation of post flood recovery procedures by water authorities at dams such as North Pine Dam, Wivenhoe Dam and Claude Wharton Weirs. Maintenance and improvement of existing fishways is currently ongoing to improve lungfish movement. <br/></p>  <p>The completion of recent research has provided new information on population status, genetic variability, spawning and habitat importance and recruitment patterns that will aid in directing future conservation actions. <br/></p>  <p>The following have been identified as the key specific objectives to mitigate major threats to Lungfish:</p>  <p>1. Reduce the impacts of, and remove any redundant, artificial barriers</p>  <p>2. Manage waterways to optimise breeding and recruitment opportunities</p>  <p>3. Address key knowledge gaps for Lungfish recruitment and its critical habitat requirements</p>  <p>4. Limit habitat degradation and maintain or enhance water quality</p>  <p>5. Reduce the impacts of introduced pest and weed species</p>  <p>6. Manage the impacts of water-based recreational activities</p>  <p>7. Address key knowledge gaps to improve Australian Lungfish management</p>  <p>8. Rehabilitate Lungfish spawning habitat after major floods</p>  <p>9. Facilitate high levels of community participation and support in the implementation of Australian Lungfish management strategies</p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global
