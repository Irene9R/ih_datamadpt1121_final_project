In British Columbia, just prior to metamorphosis, congregates immediately upriver of salt water, enters ocean from May to July (Beamish and Youson 1987). Adults probably spend much of their life in estuaries (Moyle et al. 1989).

Potential threats include habitat alteration and degradation due to dams, diversions, pollution, channelization/dredging, urbanization, and other factors (Moyle et al. 1995). Renaud (1997) stated that the major cause of lamprey species declines in the Northern Hemisphere is habitat degradation through pollution and stream regulation (dams). Stream regulation has altered some habitats and prevented access to spawning grounds (Renaud 1997).","This species is represented by a fairly large number of occurrences (subpopulations). Lee et al.

This species may be very common locally, especially at the ammocoete stage, making up a large part of the stream biomass where present; as adults, abundance is difficult to monitor because the species is anadromous (Beamish pers. comm.). Little specific abundance information is available, and general comments regarding abundance are contradictory. According to Scott and Crossman (1973), this species is probably uncommon in British Columbia although more abundant to the south. However, Moyle et al. (1995) and Moyle (2002) reported that it was abundant in British Columbia, the center of the range, but has relatively few records from California, the southernmost portion of the range. In California, it is probably most abundant (but not observed in large numbers) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin river system (Moyle et al. 1989).

According to Moyle et al. (1995) and Moyle (2002), population numbers are unknown in California but are likely declining, coincident with the degradation of suitable spawning and rearing habitat in the lower reaches of larger rivers. Because these lampreys are easy to overlook, they may be more abundant than available information indicates (Moyle 2002).

Populations are potentially critically dependent on perennial spring-fed flowing streams (I. Potter and H.

This marine stage consists of newly metamorphosed juveniles and adults (450-750 mm in length) with individuals feed parasitically on fish and potentially marine mammals (Hillyard&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1985, Renaud <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Length of the marine stage is not precisely known, but suggested to range between two and four years (McDowall 2000, Salas <em>et al.</em> 2015). Little is known about the distribution of the marine phase, but individuals may travel large distances. Adults undertake upstream spawning migrations into rivers, with transition&#160;from marine to freshwater habitats occurring in June-September (Potter <em>et al. </em>1986, James 2008, Bice <em>et al. </em>2018). Active upstream migration in the River Murray, Australia, has been documented to occur for up to six months&#160;(i.e. December) and may involve movements of &gt;800 km (SARDI unpublished data).&#160;Whilst little studied in Pouched Lamprey, freshwater ingress in several other lamprey species is mediated by olfactory cues of riverine origin, and may include juvenile pheromones (Moser <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Freshwater immigrants are pre-reproductive, and following prolonged sexual maturation, spawning occurs in spring, up to 18 months subsequent to freshwater entry (Potter <em>et al. </em>1983, Glova 1995). Baker&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2017) documented spawning habitat in New Zealand, where mating pairs spawned egg clusters under large boulders and remained with eggs/larvae post-hatching. Spawning was followed by adult mortality, up to 105 days later. The juveniles or ammocoetes are benthic worm-like filter feeding organisms (~100 mm in length) that prefer sites with sandy substrates and high detrital loads (Potter <em>et al. </em>1986, Jellyman and Glova 2002). Ammocoetes remain in freshwater until metamorphosis&#160;(3.25 to 4.25 years; Potter and Hilliard 1986), after which the sub-adult (macrophthalmia) migrates downstream to marine adult habitats.</p>","<p>Throughout the species' range, river regulation and construction of barriers (barrages, weirs and dams) have likely affected the abundance and distribution of the species.

In Australia, small weirs have obstructed upstream migration in the Murray-Darling Basin and Western Australia (Bice pers. comm. 2019). In cases where upstream migration is completely obstructed, spawning and recruitment may occur if appropriate spawning and nursery habitats exists downstream of barriers. Nonetheless, the location of spawning and nursery sites is unknown&#160;for many of the rivers inhabited by Pouched Lamprey. Whilst measures are being implemented to mitigate barriers (e.g. fishway construction), obstruction of migration&#160;will remain an issue into the future.</p><p>Changes to river flow regimes (i.e. reductions in overall discharge and altered seasonality) have likely altered migratory cues (presence of juvenile pheromones) and the quality of juvenile nursery habitats.&#160;As of 2012, reductions in 'free-flowing'&#160;reaches of rivers across the species range, as a result of dam construction, ranged 0-50% (Liermann<em> et al.&#160;</em>2012). In addition, altered land use (conversion to farmland) has likely resulted in degradation of spawning/nursery habitats (e.g. siltation)&#160;in many parts of the species range. In New Zealand, adults now likely have to travel greater distances to find suitable spawning habitat (as a result of land use), which may impact on adult condition, whilst the overall area of suitable spawning habitat has likely decreased.

Maitland <em>et al.</em> (2015) state&#160;<em>'There has been a huge decline in the numbers of upstream migrating pouched lamprey in southwestern Australia and Tasmania and the same is true for the short-headed lamprey </em>Mordacia mordax <em>in southeastern mainland Australia and Tasmania (Ian C. Potter, Murdoch University, Western Australia, personal communication, 2011, 2012)'. </em>Nevertheless,&#160;the magnitude of these declines is unknown and poorly documented, largely owing to the difficulty in sampling lamprey.</p>",Unknown,"<p>This species is native and widely distributed across the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, except for South Africa. This includes south-western and south-eastern Australia, New Zealand and southern South America (McDowall 2000, Allen <em>et al. </em>2002, James 2008).</p><p>In Australia, it occurs in coastal drainages of southwestern Australia from Perth to Albany (WA), south-eastern Australia from St Vincent's Gulf (SA) to Lakes Entrance (Vic.), and Tasmania.</p><p>In New Zealand, it is broadly distributed throughout the North and South Islands, as well as the&#160;Chatham Islands and Stewart Island (James 2008).</p><p>In South America, it is broadly distributed in coastal catchments of southern Chile and Argentina (33°- 55° Latitude South), also the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island (Renaud 2011). This part of the distribution is now shown on the map, as the data have not yet been made public.</p>","<p>Historically, this species was an important food source for Maori in New Zealand and elaborate weirs were constructed to catch them. This traditional fishery still occurs on a small scale in the Whanganui River near Pipiriki (NIWA 2013). Lampreys are harvested during the adult upstream migration phase not long after they have entered freshwater (James 2008).</p><p>There is no trade in this taxon.</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>Whilst little formal conservation action is in place for Pouched Lamprey, the species is likely benefiting from actions to improve general fish passage at&#160;many artificial barriers in rivers throughout the species range. In the River Murray, Australia, fishways have now been constructed on the Murray Barrages near the river mouth, and all main channel weirs. These fishways successfully facilitate the passage of upstream migrating adult lamprey (SARDI unpublished data) and have potentially reopened &gt;2,250 km of river to lamprey migration. Many fishways have also been constructed on barriers in coastal streams in Victoria and Western Australia that likely facilitate the upstream and downstream migration of Pouched Lamprey (e.g. Beatty <em>et al.</em> 2007, O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 2010). Fishways have also been constructed in parts of Tasmania, and some trap and transfer occurs at particular dams (e.g. Meadowbank Dam; Hydro Tasmania).</p><p>Additionally in Australia, in recent years environmental water in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) has been allocated by water managers (the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office) for release from the Murray Barrages during the peak upstream migration period (winter), to stimulate freshwater ingress. Such actions are now included in the MDB's Basin-wide Environmental Watering Strategy.</p>",Australasian|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
