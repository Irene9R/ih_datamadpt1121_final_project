However, this fishery operates in only 5-10% of its range, and there is no indication of widespread population decline throughout the species distribution. It is listed as Least Concern. Given its commercial importance, current and future fisheries for this species should be carefully monitored.","This species is found on shelves and slopes at depths from 40-1,100 m (eastern North Atlantic) and from 75-742 m depth (western North Atlantic). The maximum depth record (1,006 m) given by Wisner and McMillan (1995) for western North Atlantic population was based on a single specimen (ISH 431-1986) recently reidentified as <em>Myxine jespersenae</em>, which was in fact collected off southeastern Iceland (MÃ¸ller <em>et al.</em> 2005). The sex ratio of females and males in the samples analyzed by Martini <em>et al.</em> (1997) was highly skewed, at 9.8:1, which is typical for the species as a whole. The paucity of males in population on both sides of the Atlantic has long been recognized, but it remains unexplained.<br/><br/>This species is found on muddy bottoms where they hide in the mud. Slime is utilized for defence and it feeds chiefly on dead and dying fish of varying species by boring into the body and consuming viscera and musculature. The species is chiefly nocturnal.  Its eggs are few in number about 19-30 mm and large (20-25 mm), the horny shell has a cluster of anchor-tipped filaments at each end. The copulatory organ is absent in this species.

However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies (Patzner 1998).","Data on the developing fishery on the western Atlantic population of <em>M. glutinosa</em> has been collected by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and by the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) (Martini and Flescher 2002). In 1991, two boats made 32 trips over an 8-month period. During 1993, some 890,000 lb of hagfish were landed at Gloucester, Sandwich, Hampton, and Stonington. During 1994, five boats were involved in full-time hag fishing and made a total of 796 trips. Catches rose during 1997-1999, totalling 11.5 million lb and generating approximately US $3.3 million. Over the period 1991-1996, roughly 50 million hagfish were processed and shipped overseas; during 1997-1999, that number grew to roughly 212 million. Hagfish shorter than 500 mm, the minimum length suitable for leather, are discarded into the surface waters, where they quickly become moribund. On some trips, over 50% of the catch was discarded as unmarketable. Under these conditions the number of individuals removed from the environment would be more than twice the number landed ashore.  It is not known what effects such a decline will have on the benthic ecology. However, from a regulatory perspective it is obviously difficult to set defensible quotas or guidelines for a fishery when virtually nothing definitive is known about the size of the population, their reproductive potential, their individual growth rates, or their longevity.<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Maine (GOM), Atlantic hagfish are caught using modified 55-gallon plastic barrels, called hagfish pots, attached to sinking line and buoys. Typically 20-40 traps are deployed in a string for a small commercial vessel and 80-200 traps for larger vessels (NEFSC 2003). A series of funnelled holes in the side of the barrel allow hagfish to enter the baited pot but doesnât allow them to escape. Several rows of 3/8â holes allow smaller animals to escape the traps.<br/><br/>Reporting of Atlantic hagfish landings is presently not required by law and fishery data are therefore incomplete. Atlantic hagfish landings first appear in the NEFSC commercial database in 1993 with a reported landing of approximately 500 metric tons. Annual reported landings during 1994-2000 ranged between 1,100 and 3,000 metric tons with a peak in 2000 (Keith 2006). <br/><br/>Reported commercial hagfish trips ranged from 94 trips in 1994 to 863 trips in 1996 and averaged slightly above 400 trips per year during 1994-2000. Landings during 2001 to 2005 have ranged from 700-1,300 metric tons per year. Trips targeting Atlantic hagfish declined after 2001, averaging 253 per year (Keith 2006) NMFS Logbook database indicated that the number of vessels in the hagfish fishery peaked at 23 vessels in 1996 and 22 vessels in 2000 (Keith 2006). Since 2000 there has been a steady decline of vessels reporting landings, with only six vessels reporting in 2005.<br/><br/>A data collection program has been proposed for Atlantic Hagfish by NMFS requiring seafood dealers to acquire permits and report on the purchase of hagfish made from commercial fishing vessels to aid in the future management of this species (Federal Register 2006, Keith 2006).",This species is known to be very abundant and has a large distribution.,Unknown,"There are two populations from the North Atlantic Ocean of this species.

The fishery has not ceased despite low population levels. Extrapolating this across the full range of the species, there has been an estimated 23% decline since 1980. This species is listed as Near Threatened. More research is needed to determine the status of the species population.","This is a shallow waters species living at depths from 5-270 m. It is a nocturnally active animal, with about 70% of the observed individuals uncovered and out of the burrows as compared to about 3% by day (Fernholm 1974). It is, so far, the only species of hagfish that has been found to have a certain spawning time at the population level and an annual migration to spawning grounds (Dean 1904, Kobayashi <em>et al.</em> 1972, Fernholm 1974, Nozaki <em>et al.</em> 2000). A population living at 6-10 m depth on a muddy bottom in Koajiro Bay, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, was not found from July to September in the shallow waters of the bay. In this period, individuals from the same population were caught in deeper waters of 50 m and 100 m, where they presumably spawn (Fernholm 1974 Nozaki <em>et al.</em> 2000). Tsuneki <em>et al.</em> (1983) described the same behaviour for specimens from Kamo Bay (about 20 m depth), south end of Dogo Island, Japan, which migrate to adjacent deepest waters (50 m) outside the bay for breeding in September. According to Tsuneki <em>et al.</em> (1983), of 362 specimens collected, 167 (46%) were males, 188 (52%) were females, and seven (2%) were hermaphrodites. The mean length was 50.8 cm for males and 48.9 cm for females. There were 44 mature eggs per female on average.

Reported landings for this species are mixed with the Black Hagfish (<em>E. deani</em>) and have been quite variable in both total catch and effort over the past 20 years (1988-2007). The reasons for the variability in catch and effort trends are not well understood. This species is therefore currently listed as Data Deficient. More research is needed to quantify the impacts of fishing on this species population.","This species is found on the continental shelves and upper slopes at depths from 16-966 m. Environmental information from Mayne Bay on Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island, indicates that <em>Eptatretus stoutii</em> occurs on substrates consisting mainly by silt and in waters characterized by high near-bottom salinity (31-32â°) but low surface salinity (24â°) into which they occasionally swim (McInerney and Evans 1970).<br/><br/>Based on Oregon hagfish fishery, Barss (1993) sampled 924 Pacific hagfish from commercial and research catches, from 1988 through 1989. Mean length of fish sampled from commercial landings was 39.6cm. Fifty percent maturity for male and female was 35 cm and 42 cm, respectively. Examination of gonads indicates that spawning occurs throughout the year. Mature Pacific hagfish females averaged 28 eggs over 5 mm in length.<br/><br/>Of 309 specimens examined by Howard Ayres, 182 (59%) were males, 121 (39%) females, and six (2%) hermaphrodites (Conel, 1931). Also, of 870 specimens examined by Wisner and McMillan (1990), in which the sex was reliably determined, 51% were male and 49% female. These ratios contrast notably with other eastern Pacific hagfishes, in which females dominated by 60-74%. The largest egg found measured 28.6 x 7.5 mm, obtained from a 435 mm female. The number of developed eggs (20mm or longer) varies from 11 (23 x 7 mm) in a 330 mm female to 48 (20 x 6 mm) in one of 515 mm TL.<br/><br/>This species inhabits fine silt and clay bottoms. It enters large fishes by way of the mouth and anus and feed on its viscera and muscles and may greatly diminish catches taken with fixed gears. This species produces mucilaginous slime when harassed (Hart 1973). The copulatory organ is absent in this species (Patzner 1998).","This species is targeted in trap fisheries along the west coast of North America for the Asian leather market. Whole frozen fish are shipped to South Korea for the eel skin leather market.<br/><br/>In 1988, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife began sampling and monitoring the development of a new fishery for Pacific Hagfish (<em>Eptatretus stoutii</em>) and Black Hagfish (<em>E. deani</em>) (Barss 1993). Hagfish landings by Oregon trap vessels ranged from 11 metric tonnes in 1988 to a peak of 340 metric tonnes in 1992. In the 1988 catch, about 35% (4,165kg) was <em>E. deani</em>, the rest was <em>E. stoutii</em>. The estimate of catch per trap using âKorean trapsâ was 1.4 kg.  <br/><br/>In 1989, three vessels landed 156 tonnes of hagfish at Newport and Astoria, with a decreased CPUE catch of about 0.8 kg of hagfish per trap. In 1990, the catch dropped with 11 vessels landing 75 tonnes of hagfish from 102 trips (0.73 tonnes/trip) but since then there has been an increase in total hagfish landings and CPUE but the catch has mostly been comprised of <em>E. stoutii</em>. In 1991, 12 vessels landed 124 metric tonnes from 131 trips (0.94 tonnes/trip), and in 1992, 15 vessels landed 340 metric tonnes of hagfish from 310 trips (1.09 tonnes/trip) (Barss 1993). Mixed catch reported from the US to the FAO, also shows a variable but increasing trend in landings from a low of 100 tonnes in 2000 to a peak of 600 tonnes in 2005 (FishSTAT 2009). <br/><br/>Catch data from British Columbia is very low, but suggests that there has been a decline in effort along with decline in metric tonnes landed. However it is not known how much of this decline was due to the poor quality of skins that were produced, or a decline in abundance of the hagfish, or to competition from the east coast fisheries.",This species is known to be abundant across its distribution range.

Because of the paucity of the local source of roast hagfish, <em>Paramyxine atami</em> sold in Teradomari near Niigata, a large amount of <em>M. garmani</em> were imported from Onahama (eastern Japan) to Teradomari  (western Japan) until 1994 in order to supplement the <em>Paramyxine</em> catch. However, the hagfish catch off Onahama declined rapidly, perhaps due to overfishing by Japanese and Korean boats off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture (Honma 1998). While catch data is mixed and reported as aggregate for Hagfish, the hag fishery in this region has declined both in terms of numbers of boats and in size of catch (Gorbman <em>et al</em>. 1990, Honma 1998), but has increased in value.<br/><br/>Mixed hagfish landings data in this region between 1980 and 1995 shows a 70% decline in total hagfish catch (Gorbman <em>et al.</em> 1990; Honma 1998) and effort has remained consistent through this period, likely as a result of low abundance levels.
