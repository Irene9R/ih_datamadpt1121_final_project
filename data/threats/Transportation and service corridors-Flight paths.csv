22030377,5074,Coelops frithii,Near Threatened,A4c,2019,2018-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species is listed as Near Threatened, approaching criterion A4c,  because the global population has likely declined at a rate between  20-25% over the past five years due to a decline in its extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), and the  loss and disturbance of forest and cave systems across its range. The  declines are expected to continue for at least another 10 years (three  generations in total; GL = 5 years, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The species has been recorded from various types of forest, including  karst forest, lowland secondary forest, subtropical forest, submontane  forest, and mangrove (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Lee <em>et al.</em> 2007, Bates <em>et al.</em> 2008, Furey <em>et al.</em> 2010, Loi and Thong). It has also been observed flying near surface of backwater near forest (Abramov <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/><br/>It is primarily a cave-dweller and uses several types of roosting habitats such as cave, tree hollow (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002), man-made tunnel, abandoned mining cave (Fang and Cheng 2011),  and beneath of big rock (Tsai, W.-Y. pers. comm.). In Taiwan, roost  sites are highly associated with forest. It has been recorded using the  same caves with <em>Rhinolophus monoceros</em>, <em>R. formosae</em>, <em>Hipposideros  armiger</em>, <em>Myotis laniger</em> and <em>Miniopterus fuliginosus </em>(Fang and Cheng  2011). In Vietnam, this species is known from the same cave with  <em>Hipposideros alongensis</em> (Thong <em>et al.</em> 2012) and with <em>Rhinolophis  affinis</em>, <em>Rh. pusillus</em>, <em>Hipposideros larvatus</em> and <em>Myotis muricola</em> in  other caves (Son, unpublished data). In Indonesia, this species roosts  in the cave, together with <em>Hipposideros larvatus </em>(Wiantoro, S. pers.  Com.). Several maternity colonies with 100-200 mature individuals have  been reported from artificial caves and abandoned tunnels in mountain  areas with elevation up to 900m asl (Ho, Y.-Y. and Huang, J. C.-C.,  unpub. data). <br/><br/>Pregnant females were observed between March to  May and gave birth of one offspring in May and June. Young bats were  able to fly by 40 days after the birth. No evidence shows it hibernates  or torpors in a year. In Taiwan, the species remains active in winter,  when most of the other cave bat species hibernate (Fang and Cheng 2011).  <br/><br/>It is generally a lowland species, of which most occurrence  reports were from elevation less than 1,000 m asl. The species is found  foraging mainly in clutter vegetation close to the ground in forest  understory (Fang, Y.-P. pers. com.), which is likely associated with its  slow flight (Lai 2000) and low duty-cycled echolocation strategy (Ho <em>et al.</em>  2013). In Taiwan, the species has been reported to feed mainly on  spiders and some insects, including adult lepidopterans, coleopterans,  dipterans and homopterans (Fang and Cheng 2011).","Overall the species is most likely threatened by habitat loss and  degradation associated with ongoing deforestation and disturbances to  roosts in large area of its distribution range in Southeast Asia, South  Asia and China. Declining of population is expected at the global scale.  In Taiwan, decreasing gene flows among geographic populations with  increasing geographic distance were reported (Fang and Cheng 2011),  suggesting the species is a poor disperser. In account of the  association with forest and slow flight behavior, it is presumably  vulnerable to loss and fragmentation of forest. The expansion of road  systems could also threat the species. Two roadkill incidences are  reported from lowland in Taiwan where forest is highly fragmented by  road systems (<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://roadkill.tw/"">https://roadkill.tw/</a>).  Roost disturbances and destruction likely threaten the species. Loss of  roost sites, especially large maternity roosts, is expected to  interrupt gene flows among the nearby colonies. Light pollution might be  also a threat since individuals are observed avoiding artificial light  by cave entrance (Huang, J. C.-C., pers. obs.). In South Asia, some  populations are threatened by deforestation, generally resulting from  logging operations and the conversion of land to agriculture and  settlements especially in the Indian northeast (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002). In Bangladesh, cyclones represent an additional threat to the  habitat. In Indonesia, especially Java Island, limestone mining is  become the major threat on their roosting sites (Wiantoro S, pers. obs).","The species is thought to undergoing a past and continuing decline  across its range. Although the species is widespread, it does not appear  to be common. This may indicate its natural rarity or reflect  difficulties in surveying the species. It is usually found in groups of  less than 20 or fewer individuals in South Asia (Molur <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002), Thailand (Bates <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2008) and Taiwan (Fang and Cheng 2011), except a few colonies of 50~350  animals in Taiwan (Fang and Cheng 2011, Ying-Yi Ho pers. obs.).",Decreasing,"This widespread species ranges from South Asia eastwards into  southeastern China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. In South Asia this  species is presently known from Bangladesh Sunderbans (Khulna division)  and India (Meghalaya and West Bengal) (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002). In  China, it has been recorded from the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong,  Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan, Sichuan and the island of Hainan (Smith and Xie  2013). In Southeast Asia it ranges from Myanmar, through all countries  in the region, to Thailand and Indonesia (including the islands of  Sumatra, Java and Bali). The presence of this species in Cambodia is  previously uncertain (Bates <em>et al.</em> 2008), but recently confirmed from the northern part of the country (Sarak <em>et al.</em>  2013). In Taiwan, it has been recorded from elevations ranging from  lowland to 1900 m asl, while most known records were from below 300 m  (Fang and Cheng 2011). In Vietnam, it is recorded from lowland to 700 m  asl, however, they are found from the karst areas of the north and  center areas (Kruskop 2013, Loi and Thong 2017). In Indonesia, this  species has been recorded from two limestone areas, which are Tuban  karst area in East Java and Gunungsewu karst area in Central Java.",,Terrestrial,"The species is considered vulnerable and protected in China (Smith and  Xie 2013) and Taiwan (Cheng et al 2017), most likely due to its rarity.  It has been recorded from several protected areas in Southeast Asia and  Taiwan. It might be present in protected areas in South Asia and China.  Within South Asia there is a need for programmes to increase public  awareness about the species and bats in general (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002). Protection of roost sites and the surrounding forest, especially  for those support large maternity colonies and connect different  subpopulations, are critical to maintain the population and gene  diversity for the species. Additional research to monitor the key  roosts, understand the influences of roost disturbances, habitat  degradation and development of road systems are needed.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry. The “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Pacific Walruses by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a quota is determined annually. Russian legislation prohibits sport hunting of Pacific Walruses, and a variety of types of protection are afforded to major haulout sites along the Russian coast (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Despite its current population trend, the species remains potentially threatened by a number of factors. It tends to congregate in very large flocks, and suffered rapid declines in many parts of its range during the twentieth century because of hunting and other threats. Its roost sites are unprotected, large numbers died in a recent disease outbreak, and most importantly, the dry rice paddies where it feeds are being converted to vegetable farms and other uses. If evidence arises in the future that these threats have begun to drive a decline, the species may warrant uplisting.<p></p> <p></p>","It nests in open tussock meadows near water and in mossy bogs with clumps of willows <em>Salix</em> and larch <em>Larix</em>. It winters (in dense aggregations) on freshwater lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and farmland, often roosting on water during the day and feeding in fields during the night. It feeds on seeds and grain, water snails, algae and other water plants. The species arrives on its Korean wintering grounds from September, peaking through October and November and returning north in mid March/early April (Degtyarev <em>et al</em>. 2006).","Hunting was probably the main reason for its decline and is still a serious threat, particularly as it concentrates in large flocks on wetlands and arable land. However, hunting itself is now thought to be in decline (Moores 1996, Moores <em>et al</em>. 2010). In China and South Korea, birds are killed by poisoned grain; pesticide poisoning and pollution from agricultural and household wastes are thought to be a serious problem in the Geum River, South Korea (Degtyarev <em>et al</em>. 2006). Large declines in the numbers of Anatidae have occurred in Sanjiang plain and Poyang Hu, China, as a result of habitat loss to agricultural development and hunting. Wintering sites in South Korea are largely unprotected and threatened by the development of wetlands (N. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2010); there has been a recent proposal for building the largest tourist development in northeast Asia on the Haenem reclamation site, a key site for wintering Baikal Teal (C. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2005). Also, its habit of forming dense aggregations in winter renders the species susceptible to infectious diseases; 10,000 birds were recorded dead owing to avian cholera in October, 2002 (Degtyarev <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species suffers from disturbance at the Geum River with up to 12 incidences per day of disturbance from low flying aircraft (Degtyarev <em>et al</em>. 2006).","The 2004 Asian Waterbird Census estimated the population in Korea at 455,000 individuals (D.

Further to this, Brazil (2009) has estimated national population sizes at &lt;c.100 breeding   pairs and c.50-10,000 wintering individuals in China and c.10,000-1 million   breeding pairs in Russia.",Increasing,"<em>Sibirionetta formosa</em> breeds in eastern Siberia, <strong>Russia</strong> and occurs on passage in <strong>Mongolia</strong> and <strong>North Korea</strong>.

In the early 20th century, it was one of the most numerous ducks in eastern Asia and flocks of many thousands were regularly reported, but a significant decline took place since the 1960s and 1970s. Since then however, wintering counts in South Korea have increased spectacularly from the c.20,000 located in the 1980s to a total of 658,000 recorded during simultaneous surveys in 2004, including c. 600,000 in the lower reaches of the Geum River, and a staggering total of c.1.06 million counted in January 2009 (Moores <em>et al</em>. 2010, N. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2010), with concentrations of over 20,000 at six different sites (N. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In support of the view that a genuine population increase has taken place in South Korea, an analysis of counts conducted at 38 sites every year since 1999 indicate an increase from a yearly average of 11,533 in 1999-2003 to a yearly average of 314,994 in 2005-2009 (N. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2010). The increase in the South Korean wintering population is believed to be linked an increase in newly reclaimed land as well as a decline in hunting pressure (Moores 1996, Moores <em>et al</em>. 2010, N. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In January 2006 a flock of 8,000-10,000 individuals was noted at the small Chongming Dongtan Ramsar Site in China (where the previous maximum was 300 individuals) and in 2006/2007 a flock of 50,000 was recorded at Yancheng National Nature Reserve; these represent the largest flocks recorded outside of South Korea in recent years (Zhang Kejia <em>in litt.</em> 2006, Zhang 2006).

As soon as the young fledge, breeding birds begin to congregate in loose flocks which can be many thousands strong (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. The species migrates southwards between late-June and October. During the autumn migration it may roost in flocks of tens of thousands at favoured sites<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996), and this is the main moulting period for adult birds. The <em>islandica&#160;</em>subspecies moults in northwest Europe, while western populations of the nominate subspecies often moult in north Morrocco (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016), and many adults pause in north Morocco in July to moult. Huge flocks occur at some wintering sites, particularly in the floodplains of Lake Chad.&#160;The return passage occurs between February and April<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1996), and birds arrive at the breeding grounds in groups of 5-30 individuals (Johnsgard 1981)<strong></strong>. Many one-year-old birds remain in the wintering range during the summer. During the winter and migration the species usually forages gregariously<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> In its breeding range it mostly inhabits areas with high but not dense grass and soft soil<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996, Johnsgard 1981,&#160;Schekkerman and Beintema 2007, Tomkovich and Lebedeva 1998), occasionally using sandy areas; although other information suggests it may prefer short vegetation (Laursen and Hald 2012). Its preferred habitats include cattle pastures, hayfields (Johnsgard 1981), lowland wet grasslands, grassy marshland, raised bogs and moorland, lake margins and damp grassy depressions in steppes<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1996). Subspecies <em>islandica </em>shows a distinct preference for large patches of dwarf-birch bog and marsh, particularly with abundant sedge-pools<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996, Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2006). Extensive farmland habitats are of critical importance for breeding Western European populations<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996), with y<span lang=""NL"">oung, that grow up in herb-rich meadows recruiting to the breeding population 2.5 times better than young that grow up in monocultures (Kentie <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In intensively managed grasslands small shallow pools attract breeding godwits and, in combination with herb rich meadows, may improve breeding succes (Weterings <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;After the young have fledged, adults and fledglings often move to secondary habitat which more closely resembles that of their non-breeding range, including wet damp areas around fish-ponds and sewage farms, tidal marshes, mud flats and salt-water lagoons (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, Tucker and Heath 1994)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>Subspecies <em>limosa </em>tends to winter in freshwater habitats<strong></strong>, including swampy lake shores, pools, flooded grassland and irrigated rice fields<strong></strong>. Subspecies <em>islandica </em>and <em>melanuroides</em>, however,<em> </em>often winter in saline habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996) such as sheltered estuaries and lagoons with large intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), sandy beaches, salt-marshes and salt-flats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996). Despite these general differences there is considerable overlap in wintering habitat between sympatric populations of subspecies <span style=""font-style: italic;"">limosa</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">islandica</span> (Alves <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Lopes <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Seasonally-flooded grassland is a critical habitat for the birds wintering in Ireland (Hayhow 2008). Birds on passage in Iberia make much use of rice fields (Lourenço <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (especially beetles), annelid and polychaete worms, molluscs, ragworms, crustaceans, spiders, fish eggs, and the spawn and tadpoles of frogs<strong> </strong>(Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996). On the breeding grounds grasshoppers and other orthopterans are often prevalent in the diet (Johnsgard 1981). Particularly during the winter and on migration it will also take plant material including berries, seeds and rice grains<strong> </strong>(Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, Lourenço <em>et al. </em>2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. On its wintering grounds in Portugal, the bivalve <em>Scrobicularia plana</em> has been found to represent its primary food source (Moreira 1994), while&#160;in the salinas of Spain, it mainly feeds on chironomid larvae (Estrella and Masero 2010).&#160;<span lang=""NL""><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is placed on the ground in short, often luxurious vegetation<strong> </strong>(Johnsgard 1981, Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It consists of a shallow scrape 12-15cm in diameter, lined with a thick mat of stem grass, leaves and other available vegetation (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983). Breeding birds show a high degree of nest site fidelity<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996) and some degree of natal philopatry (Kruk <em>et al.</em> 1998) which is more pronounced among males (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2011). <p></p></span>","Loss of nesting habitat owing to wetland drainage and agricultural intensification, and conversely abandonment in some parts of the range, are the most significant threats (Mischenko 2008,&#160;Kentie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land and loss of habitat to development (Tucker and Heath 1994), increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland&#160;(Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), earlier and more frequent cutting as farmers adapt to climate change (Kleijn&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010), spring burning and scrub encroachment (A. Mischenko&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007)&#160;and possibly disturbance by walkers (Holm and Laursen 2009). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of egg and chick mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Kentie <em>et al. </em>2015). On intensively grazed pastures, trampling is a major cause of nest loss, and a switch to monoculture on arable land reduces the supply of insects on which the species feeds (Kentie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to silage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">A study in<span lang=""EN-US""> the central regions of <span lang=""EN-US"">European Russia suggests that<span lang=""EN-US""> <span lang=""EN-US"">significant decline in spring flood levels during two last decades, as a result climate change, has <span lang=""EN-US"">strengthened<span lang=""EN-US""> the negative impact of agricultural abandonment (<span lang=""EN-US"">A.

Indeed, sink locations have been documented for the species, where birds recruited from good quality habitat disperse to low quality habitats (often suffering high predation) effectively losing these individuals to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Leigh&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1980, Reijnen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996<strong></strong>). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)<strong></strong>.&#160;The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestion of the lowland habitats where they breed and from ongoing agricultural expansion (Gunnarsson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Gill&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007), although this population has been increasing strongly over recent decades (BirdLife International 2015).<br/>Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture, urban expansion and agricultural intensification at rice paddies. The proposed development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Masero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the European Union (EU) in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2008), which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, for example on the African wintering grounds, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact is unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species range (H. Hötker <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, although the effects of the release of some pollutants, like untreated sewage, on this species may be minor as long as there are several alternative prey present at a site (Alves <em>et al. </em>2012). In Egypt there are plans to increase the depth of the sailing channel of the Nile, impacting upon this species's habitat there (H. Ibrahim&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994) in conjunction with the extensive drainage of wetlands in this area, for energy production, water storage and agriculture (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Invasive plants may also degrade wintering habitat in Australia (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Studies of <em>islandica</em> godwits have shown that individuals breeding in the habitats where productivity is higher also winter in the areas where survival is higher (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds.&#160;<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).<strong>&#160;</strong>The population is estimated to number&#160;102,000-149,000 pairs&#160;in Europe (including 25,000 pairs in Iceland) (BirdLife International 2015); 25,000-100,000 in west-central Asia; 150,000 in central Asia and Siberia (Asian Waterbird Census unpublished data); 160,000 in the rest of Asia and Australia.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;has a large discontinuous breeding range extending from Iceland to the Russian far east, with wintering populations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Australasia<strong> </strong>(Van Gils <em>et al. </em>2017). It occurs as three subspecies, <em>L. l. islandica</em>, <em>L. l. limosa</em>, and <em>L. l. melanuroides</em>. Subspecies<em> islandica </em>breeds predominantly in <strong>Iceland</strong>, with much smaller numbers in the <strong>Faeroe Islands</strong>, Shetland (<strong>United Kingdom</strong>) and the Lofoten Islands (<strong>Norway</strong>). This subspecies winters in roughly similar numbers in the <strong>Republic of Ireland</strong>, the United Kingdom, <strong>France, Spain</strong>&#160;and <strong>Portugal</strong>, with small numbers in the <strong>Netherlands</strong> (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016). Subspecies<em> limosa </em>breeds across a wide area extending from Western Europe and central Europe to central Asia<strong> </strong>and Asiatic Russia, as far east as the River Yenisey. The west European population of this subspecies migrates south through France and Iberia to winter largely in West Africa, while eastern breeding birds winter in southeast Europe to the Middle East, and may also be the origin of wintering birds in <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Chad</strong> and northern <strong>Cameroon</strong> (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Oomen 2008, Lourenço &amp; Piersma 2008b).&#160;Subspecies<em> melanuroides </em>breeds in disjunct populations in <strong>Mongolia, </strong>northern <strong>China</strong>, Siberia (<strong>Russia</strong>) and the Russian Far East. These birds migrates across a broad front to winter from western South Asia to <strong>A</strong><strong>ustralia</strong>, encompassing&#160;<strong>India</strong>, Indochina, <strong>Taiwan, </strong>the <strong>Philippines, Indonesia, </strong>and Melanesia (Dutson 2011, Van Gils&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).<strong>&#160;</strong><br/>Population trends vary across the range. There have been large and well-documented declines in the mainland European breeding population (of the nominate subspecies) of between 50-60% (BirdLife International 2015). For example, in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>&#160;the population decreased dramatically from 120,000-135,000 pairs in 1969 and 85,000-100,000 pairs in 1989-1991, to just 46,000-62,000 in 2009 (Tucker and Heath 1994,&#160;<strong><sup> </sup></strong>BirdLife International 2004a, <strong></strong>EU Technical Report 19 2007, Oomen 2008, Höglund <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009), 35,200-59,800 pairs in 2008-2011 (BirdLife International 2015), and potentially to 33,000 pairs in 2015 (Kentie <em>et al. </em>2016). In certain areas though, the breeding population has recently stabilised as a result of agri-environmental measures (Oosterveld <em>et al. </em>2016). These declines are mirrored in the information from West African wintering areas, with notable declines in Senegal and Morocco, while further east (Mali, Chad and north Cameroon) wintering numbers appear stable, though data is sparser (Lourenço and Piersma 2008b). This is true also for the central Asian breeding population, which is thought to be stable of fluctuating (L. Belyalova<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>, but for which there is little recent data.&#160;In the eastern flyway, declines have been estimated at between 20-30% over three generations on the species Australian wintering grounds (Garnett <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010)<strong></strong>, which hold c. 50% of the wintering population of <em>L. l. melanuroides</em><strong> </strong>(Watkins 1993).&#160;The population of <em>L. l. ilsandica, </em>in contrast, has be increasing dramatically over the past few decades, although this increase may be levelling out and the subpopulation represents a relatively small part of the global population (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Wetlands International in press)<strong></strong>.&#160;A recent analysis based on published literature, survey data and expert opinions from throughout the species range suggests that, overall, the global population may have declined at a mean rate of approximately 23% over 25 years leading up to 2015 (I.

An EU management plan for 2007-2009 was adopted, and an AEWA action plan replaced it at the end of 2008 (Anon. 2008). Intensive management of breeding habitat has been carried out in some Western European countries (H. Hötker <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, and a number of agri-environment schemes focus on this species, although results have been mixed (Musters <em>et al.</em> 2001, S. Nagy <em>in litt. </em>2005,<sup>&#160;</sup>A. Mischenko <em>in litt. </em>2007, Verhulst <em>et al.</em> 2007). A number of significant wintering areas are protected areas, as are several breeding sites in the UK and the Netherlands.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Obtain more quantitative data on status, population trends and conservation requirements outside Europe. Carry out research on survival, recruitment, breeding and migration (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Critically evaluate the effectiveness of current conservation action. In the EU, use a mixture of agri-environment schemes, direct payments to wader-friendly farmers (Musters <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2001) and large reserves to secure protection and appropriate management of breeding habitat. The coverage of agri-environment schemes in Europe should be increased (Kleijn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and increases in groundwater depth should be prioritised as an outcome (Verhulst <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). New nature reserves should be established on important sites throughout the species range, and there should be attempts to get greater coverage of key areas for this species within in the Special Protection Areas network (van der Vliet <em>et al. </em>2015).  Manage existing reserves appropriately: prescriptions include avoiding drainage of existing wet meadows, raising water tables where necessary, low-level use of organic fertiliser, low intensity grazing, late mowing, and prevention of succession to bushy vegetation. Winter flooding is sometimes recommended but may reduce numbers of invertebrate prey (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2005). On intensively farmed land, maintenance of unfertilised field margins has been shown to have positive effects (Oosterveld <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Investigate the potential for using a 'headstarting' approach to increase survival to fledging (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016). Prevent afforestation of lowland breeding habitat in Iceland. Prevent a loss of key breeding areas due to abandonment of grasslands and meadows in east Europe and Russian Far East. Monitor human disturbance as a threat.&#160;<br/>Ensure that migratory staging posts and winter feeding habitats and roosts are conserved and monitored, and knowledge of them is improved (Estrella and Masero 2010). Designate a special protection area at Extremadura's rice fields, which is a key stopover site (Masero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Manage artificial habitats appropriately, e.g. maintain low water levels in salinas such that they are available to foraging godwits (Estrella and Masero 2010), and block drainage to retain water in Iberian rice fields (Lourenço and Piersma 2008a). Protect important Yellow Sea tidal flats in China and South Korea. Engage with governments and local people throughout its migration routes. Effectively enforce the EU-wide ban on hunting until there is clear evidence that the population has returned to a favourable conservation status. Safeguard habitats in West Africa and Iberia, perhaps by offering support to rice producers (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Collaborate with farmers and hunters, carrying out environmental education and outreach work where appropriate. Restore wetland sites in Australia (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This is a migratory species, migrants leaving their breeding grounds between August and November, and returning in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It relies heavily on soaring flight using thermals, and thus avoids large bodies of water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Birds are generally observed singly or in pairs, but will congregate at plentiful food sources, and migrate in flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Porter and Aspinall 2010). <strong>Habitat </strong>It breeds near forest edges, preferring moist woodland; most nest in lowlands but it is recorded breeding up to 2,200 m in montane areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians are all taken as prey, with different prey types predominating in different parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built in trees, usually close to the forest edge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>Where populations are struggling, productivity can be increased artificially by ensuring both chicks survive to fledging: in natural conditions one is almost always lost by siblicide, known as ""cainism"" (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","The main threats posed to this species are through habitat loss (notably abandonment or conversion of grasslands into arable land and deforestation) and hunting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Meyburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). The latter is especially prevalent on migration, with possibly thousands of birds shot annually in Syria and Lebanon (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Deforestation is degrading breeding habitats (Dravecký <em>et al</em>. 2015), and disturbance caused by forestry workers reduces breeding success (Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al.</em>. 2019). Studies on habitat use in Estonia suggest that changes in agricultural practices, particularly a reduction in grassland, and an increasing sown area of oilseed rape and maize may degrade foraging habitat around breeding areas (Vali <em>et al. </em>2017). Abandonment of breeding territories has been linked to depopulation of rural areas leading to a decline in stock grazing, resulting in afforestation of grassland and a decline in rodent prey (Demerdzhiev <em>et al. </em>2019)<em>.</em>&#160;It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012). Electrocution may pose an additional threat on migration and at wintering grounds, but this has not been well studied (Demerdzhiev &amp; Ratarova-Georgieva 2017).&#160;The Chernobyl nuclear accident may have affected the species (Alon 2000 in Global Raptor Information Network 2015). Construction of the new Istanbul airport could have an impact on the species (S. Oppel <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Egg collection for private collections has been recorded in Bulgaria (unpublished data, cited in Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al </em>2019)<em>.</em>&#160;Meyburg <em>et al </em>(2018) reported an incident in which a radio tagged Lesser-spotted Eagle was struck by an aircraft in Poland, suggesting that this may be an additional threat during migration.","The European population is estimated at 17,100-23,100 pairs, which equates to 34,200-46,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms approximately 73% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 46,800-63,300 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. A survey in 2014 counted 47,594 individuals in southern Turkey (S. Oppel&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014). c.58,000 individuals were recorded in 2008 during migration counts over the Bosporus (Fülöp&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), and 51,850 were counted in 2014 at a migration bottleneck near Burgas, Bulgaria (Iankov <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;It is placed in the band 45,000 to 65,000 mature individuals.",Stable,,"Egg collection for private collections has been recorded in Bulgaria (unpublished data, cited in Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al&#160;</em>2019)<em>.</em>",Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation actions underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendix II, Raptors MOU Category 3, EU Birds Directive Annex I, Bern Convention Appendix II.

Drivers of the decline are uncertain but likely include climate change affecting prey availability, as well as collisions with vehicles and infrastructure. There remains some uncertainty about the overall rate of decline, and if it proves to be even higher the species may be eligible for further uplisting to Endangered.","<p>The species breeds on open&#160;tundra from near tree-line to edge of polar seas, with hummocks or rocks and sparse low vegetation and dwarf shrubs and lichen; locally also coastal fields and open moorland, usually at elevations below 300 m, except in Norway (where lemmings occur only on mountains at 1,000 m or higher).

Movements are unpredictable and related to abundance of prey species; thought to vary considerably from region to region across polar tundra, and intensity of movements fluctuates annually&#160;(Doyle <em>et al</em>. 2017; Holt <em>et al. </em>2017). During years of abundant prey, increased numbers of young Snowy Owls fledge and hence greater numbers therefore migrate south into the USA from their Canadian/Alaskan Arctic breeding grounds to find sufficient wintering territory, a phenomenon known as a 'snowy owl irruption' (Therrien <em>et al</em>. 2017; Curk <em>et al</em>. 2018; Santonja <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>","Historically, this species was one of the most persecuted owls in North America - thousands of owls were shot for taxidermy, and adults and eggs were hunted for food (Holt <em>et al. </em>2020). Harvesting of the species for food, feathers and claws by native peoples still occurs but has decreased significantly, therefore while it may have a local impact on populations, it is unlikely to have any wider effect on total numbers. In some areas, nesting habitat may be degraded as a result of urban development (Holt <em>et al. </em>2009). Snowy Owls getting caught in traps set for foxes may be a significant threat in some areas (Ellis &amp; Smith 1993, cited in Holt <em>et al. </em>2020), as may secondary poisoning by Warfarin bait set for rats (Campbell &amp; Preston 2009, cited in Holt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Electrocution, aeroplane strikes, collision with vehicles and entanglement in fishing equipment have all been identified as sources of mortality in Alberta, Canada (Holt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Climate change is likely to have a significant impact on the species, as changes in the onset of spring and snowmelt in the breeding areas are likely to affect prey populations (International Snowy Owl Working Group 2010).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2013) estimated the population to number approximately 200,000 individuals (Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013) (although there is some uncertainty over whether this refers to individuals or mature individuals). However, Potapov and Sale (2013) presented a 'Loose Boid’ method of estimating population size&#160;which gives far lower figures. They concluded that instead of being evenly distributed across the tundra, snowy owls could be found in seven different loose 'boids': very thinly distributed groups which move throughout given areas in line with conditions, especially food availability. The largest of these boids was suggested to be in central northern Canada and could contain 4,000 pairs. In total, they estimated that, on average, each boid may contain 2,000 pairs and so the global population size would be c.14,000 pairs or 28,000 mature individuals, which fits with a maximal estimate of 14,000 females suggested by DNA analyses by Marthinsen <em>et al. </em>(2009). However, they also suggested that the population size could be as low as 7,000-8,000 pairs (Potapov and Sale 2013). Satellite tracking projects in the Canadian Arctic and Norway have documented extensive individual movements, further suggesting that the population may have been overestimated in the past (R. Solheim and G. Gauthier&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2017).<p>The European population is estimated at 1,200-2,700 pairs, which equates to 2,400-5,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"This species has a huge range across predominantly arctic regions from western Scandinavia through northern <strong>Russia </strong>to Alaska (<strong>USA</strong>), northern <strong>Canada </strong>and <strong>Greenland (Denmark)</strong>, and has also bred occasionally in Iceland and the UK.
