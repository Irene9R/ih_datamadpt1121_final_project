Unpublished data indicate that this species may be a junior synonym of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus cheesmani</span>, and there is taxonomic confusion in several species of the genus including<span style=""font-style: italic;""> L. cheesemanii</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. gloveri, L. spadiceus</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. wheeleri</span>. <em>Lagocephalus&#160;gloveri</em> is a popular food fish in China, Taiwan and Japan. There is little species-specific population information available. This species is non-toxic and safe for consumption as processed and fresh fish product. It appears to be landed in large quantities in parts of its range, but does not appear to be particularly valuable. Based on population trends seen in other species of commercially important pufferfishes it is inferred that this species is undergoing population declines in parts of its range. It is also likely to be impacted by coastal habitat degradation, particularly near estuaries and river  mouths. Suspected population declines from exploitation and habitat degradation are not quantifiable and therefore do not meet the thresholds for a threatened category.&#160;Pending clarification concerning this species' distribution and population status, this species is assessed as Data Deficient.&#160;The taxonomy of this and several other species of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus</span> remains unresolved.<br/><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""></span>","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> is a tropical species found at depths ranging from 0-100 m.

Juveniles can be found in estuaries (Matsuura and Liu pers comm. 2011). <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> feeds on molluscs, crustaceans and fishes. It is most similar to <em>L. spadiceus</em> and <em>L. guentheri </em>in appearance (Matsuura <em>et al.</em> 2011).<p>Puffers of the genus <em>Lagocephalus</em> are globally distributed in warm shallow waters, however classification at the species level in <em>Lagocephalus</em> has not yet been studied in depth, causing confusion in the status of several species including <em>L. cheesemanii</em>, <em>L. gloveri</em>, <em>L. spadiceus</em>, and <em>L. wheeleri </em>(Matsuura <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).</p>","<strong>Pufferfish fishery<br/></strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> is impacted by pufferfish fisheries in parts of its range. In Japan, Pufferfish landings have declined since the early 1990s. Concern about the fishery centers on the most valuable and preferred species, <em>Takifugu rubripes</em>,&#160;which, as of 2010, was considered depleted in Japan.<em> </em>Landings of <em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in Japan had declined to 5% of annual landings in 1987. Landings of ""other pufferfish"", a category which includes <em>L. gloveri, </em>were maximized after the decline in <em>T. rubripes </em>landings. These ""other pufferfish"" have declined from a peak of roughly 400 tonnes in 1999 to less than 100 tonnes in 2007, a decline of roughly 75%. Declines in landings have been attributed to the effects of highly-effective long-line fishing (Kawata 2012).<br/><br/>Fishery-dependent data from China showed declines in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of<em> L. gloveri</em> from 2001 to 2003, however this data may represent several species of this genus.

Liu pers. comm. 2011). In the semi-enclosed regions of the North Bohai and Yellow Seas, large amounts of industrial and municipal effluents containing heavy metals, particularly arsenic, have been implicated in the deterioration of coastal environments (Luo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Heavy metals have also been implicated in the degradation of the heavily populated and industrialized Pearl River delta region in southern China (Cheung <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the Gulf of Thailand, coastal habitat degradation has resulted from pollution, primarily from untreated municipal and industrial waste water, as well as a rapid decrease in mangrove forests, coral reefs, and fisheries resources (Cheevaporn and Menasveta 2003).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagacephalus gloveri</span> is common and can be locally abundant (K.

These agreements restructured fishery management by giving coastal countries the ability to regulate foreign fishing vessels. The Fisheries Agency of Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which led to the establishment of an off-fishing season, restriction on minimum body size, improvements to fishing grounds, and other measures.

The species is thought to have disappeared from Almoloya (Magdalena Basin) despite recent non-targeted surveys within the area (M. Koeck pers. comm.&#160;2019), and also from El Molino pond (Laguna de Sayula valley).&#160;<em>Ameca splendens </em>is threatened by&#160;faecal contamination found in waste water discharges in the Río Teuchitlán and the lands surrounding it, which are predominantly used for livestock, meaning this species potentially faces threats from agricultural pollution and sedimentation. It is furthermore impacted from severe river fragmentation of the Río Teuchitlán, leading to augmented sedimentation, reduction of dissolved oxygen, and growth of submersal plants, and from non-native invasive species, mainly three Poeciliid species (<em>Poecilia mexicana</em>, <em>Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus</em> and <em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>). The Butterfly Splitfin is assessed as Critically&#160;Endangered (CR) because of its extremely small AOO and EOO, single location, and the continuing decline of&#160; its habitat quality.","Typical habitats of the Butterfly Splitfin include springs around Teuchitlán, characterized by clear water and sand and silt bottom. It has got two right angles in the E and S corner and an open angle in the west corner. The width is about 1 2m, the longest line extends from E to NNW and is about 25 m long. In the sharp NNW angle is an outlet into a dammed sections of the Teuchitlán river used as cattle trough, another outlet is on the outer side of the right angle, draining to the subsequent section of the river. The depth of the spring is around 1 m, the walls are concrete but bordered inwards partly with big rocks. In the E angle arises the main spring under the roots of a large <em>Metasequoia</em> tree. Though <em>Ameca splendens </em>can be also found in the following sections of the river, the species prefers to live in the spring area and has got the highest density there. Other species co-existing with the Butterfly Splitfin are the native <em>Goodea atripinnis</em> and the exotics <em>Poecilia mexicana</em>, <em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>, <em>Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus</em> and <em>Oreochromis aureus</em>.

The La Vega Dam is an important element to the maintenance of the Ameca River as well, as it controls the quality and volume and flow of this river, which is highly detrimental to species inhabiting this river&#160;(Ramsar Secretariat 2009). Additional threats on a&#160; different scale come from people using the Teuchitlán spring area as recreation area and from invasive non-native species. While the first threat seems to be negligible at current extent, the aggressive predatory Poeciliid fish species seems to have a much heavier impact, especially outside of the springs.&#160;<em>Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus, </em>one of the invasive species,&#160;is highly aggressive and a major threat to many native fish, being a predator and feeding from fry, attacking juveniles and dispersing them, so a slight reduction in quantity of specimens can be already inferred.","There is insufficient information regarding population size.

Recent surveys (January to March 2018) showed some distinct declines of the <em>Melanochelys trijuga thermalis</em> (A. de Silva pers. obs.). Presently available data do not allow an approximation of the percentage decline over the past three generations or a prediction for a current three-generation period extending into the future. The species was considered Least Concern in India, but is generally considered threatened in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, and some subspecies (<em>coronata, edeniana, parkeri</em>) may be threatened.</p>","<p><em>Melanochelys trijuga</em> is a highly adaptable semi-aquatic species, it uses both natural and man-made ponds, temple ponds, pools, and other waterbodies with aquatic vegetation, but has also been encountered in rivers and other flowing waters (Das 1991) and agro wells (A. de Silva pers. obs. 2018).&#160; It inhabits altitudes up to 300 m in the Terai (Schleich and Kästle 2002). In Sri Lanka this semi-aquatic species is considered to be the most common Testudinae inhabiting all three altitudinal plains (up to 1,400 m above sea level) (Deraniyagala 1939) and climatic zones: wet, intermediate, and dry. Northwestern subpopulations appear to be more dependant on forest habitats.<br/><br/><em>Melanochelys t. thermalis</em>, though essentially an aquatic and nocturnal reptile, may be encountered far away from water, either crossing roads or other foraging activity or basking on rocks or tree trunks that are in water, or recently observed climbing trees (de Silva <em>et al.</em> 2018). It can move well on land. On capture, the animal struggles leading to scratching which was the most frequent (38.16%) defensive behaviour observed. This is followed (15.79%) by emission of faecal gas and defecation (Abeysekera&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/>The species feeds opportunistically on a variety of animal and plant foods (Das 1991). In Sri Lanka there are many village houses where the turtle come and feed on cooked rice where pots and pans are washed. The species is primarily crepuscular or nocturnal, seen foraging after dark along the edges of waterbodies.&#160;Basking on boulders in water or tree trunks or on land is a common feature of the species.<br/><br/>Maximum size, and presumably size at maturity, vary substantially between the different subspecies. In a series of ten <em>M. t. parkeri </em>specimens, the curved carapace length ranged from 33 to 43 cm (A. de Silva pers. obs.). It probably matures in about 5 years (I. Das pers. comm. 2018). Generation length is about 15 years. Two to six clutches comprising one to four eggs are laid in a year; though there may be some variability between subspecies (review in Das 1991). A detailed account of the reproductive biology of <em>M. t. thermalis </em>is reported by Deraniyagala (1939).</p>","<p><em>Melanochelys trijuga</em> is used for subsistence consumption throughout much of its range (Das 1991, de Silva in Das 1991, de Silva 2011, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000, Schleich and Kästle 2002), and continues to occur in some numbers in the East Asian food trade. <em>Melanochelys trijuga </em>was not encountered in 35 surveyed Indian markets before 1983 (Moll 1983), but was encountered in two of 61 markets surveyed in 1991–1993 (Choudhury and Bhupathy 1993). Locally its eggs are collected and consumed (Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). Small numbers of juveniles occur in the pet trade.<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka during de Silva's surveys and other field work, three major threats faced by this terrapin were observed. The principal threat was collection of&#160; the animal for its flesh and eggs (considered medicinal and aphrodisiacs) and also for illegal sale. Many inland fishermen who were interviewed from many parts of the island reported that these terrapins occasionally get entangled in their nets and only a few are released back, others are eaten or sold. The other threat was observing dead specimens on roads where their death is caused due to road-related accidents. In Nepal, accidental or deliberate fires to promote growth have been known to kill this species (Das 2009).&#160;</p>","<p>In Bangladesh the species (ssp.<em> indopeninsularis</em>) is apparently restricted to hill streams of the eastern regions, where it was considered Data Deficient (Rashid and Khan 2000) but more recently (2010) was considered to have declined severely, to the point where it was considered Critically Endangered in the country (S.M.A Rashid pers. comm. at Singapore Red List Workshop Feb. 2011).<br/><br/>In India <em>Melanochelys trijuga</em> is considered common in many localities, though localised declines were suspected. Subspecies<em> trijuga </em>was considered secure (Lucknow Red List Workshop Participants Sept. 2005), while the status of subspecies <em>coronata </em>was deemed indeterminate, possibly Vulnerable by Choudhury <em>et al. </em>(2000), but was considered as of least conservation concern by participants at the 2011 Singapore Red List Workshop. Similarly, <em>M. t. indopeninsularis&#160;</em>was considered to be common in the terai region and to be of least concern (Participants Singapore Red List Workshop Feb. 2011).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, the endemic subspecies <em>M. t. edeniana</em> is uncommon to rare, a trend that appears to have continued to the point where it was considered quite rare by 2010, and noted that it was often observed in trade shipments (Participants Singapore Red List Workshop Feb. 2011).<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka the species was considered threatened due to exploitation (de Silva, in Das 1991). Recent observations by (A. de Silva pers. obs. 2018) showed many killed due to road traffic, many farmers informed that at present they see less possibly due to the large quantities of agro-chemical used to paddy fields.&#160;The species inhabit in agricultural canals and other water ways in the paddy fields.<br/><br/>Seventy nine freshwater habitats located outside the protected area network of southwestern Sri Lanka were surveyed and showed low densities of 1–2 individuals per ha (Karunarathna <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Melanochelys trijuga</em> occurs across most of India, Sri Lanka, southern Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar (Iverson 1992; Das 1991, 1995).

Its large size (carapace length 383 mm) when compared to other subspecies.&#160;<br/>2.	Not uncommon in Sri Lanka. <br/>3.	The sutures between the carapace bones are more or less distinct, suggesting that their size is not due to old age, which obliterates in <em>thermalis.</em>&#160;<br/>4.	The shape of the carapace suggests a greater terrestrial adaptation than the smaller <em>thermalis</em>.<br/><br/>Status surveys of the various subspecies, with emphasis on occurrence in protected areas, are needed, particularly in Myanmar, where no data exists for the last century.

Generation time is not known, but by analogy with other large softshells it will not be less than a decade. Quantitative data are not available, but an estimate that most populations have halved, and the fact that several populations have disappeared completely, indicates that the species has had a population size reduction of at least 80% over three generations (30 years), and that this decline is continuing. The species therefore qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered (CR A2cd +4cd).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p><em>Pelochelys cantorii</em> inhabits large lowland rivers, lakes, reservoirs and estuarine areas including mangrove channels and coastal mudflats near river mouths (Moll 1985, Das 1991, Thirakhupt and van Dijk, 1995, Choudhury<em> et al.</em> 2000). It nests on riverbanks and sea beaches (Moll 1985, Das 1991).<br/><br/><em>Pelochelys cantorii</em> feeds on a variety of animal prey, mainly fish and crustaceans. It's flattened head and widely spaced eyes suggest that this species is an ambush feeder, with striking behaviour being observed in captive specimens (Das 2008).<br/><br/>Maximum size not known in detail; usually stated to reach 100–180 cm carapace length, but most reports of very large <em>P. cantorii</em> have proved to be based on misidentified <em>Chitra</em> and <em>Rafetus</em>. The largest vouchered specimens from Thailand are about 60 cm carapace length.<br/><br/>Age and size at maturity have not been recorded. Females produce clutches of 24–28 eggs (Moll 1985); but has been reported as 40–701 in the Ouijan River in China (Gu <em>et al</em>. 2000), multiple clutching is possible but not confirmed. Zhao and Li (2017) report that clutches are over ten eggs, with a maximum 100 per clutch.

More recently it has also appeared in the Calipee trade (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).&#160; It is rarely seen in markets in Malaysia, Thailand, India or elsewhere. Nest poaching has also been noted (Choudhury <em>et al. </em>2000).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation and loss are probably particularly acute for this species, with lower river basins and estuarine areas particularly heavily impacted by human settlement, cities, harbours, ports and industrial development, and nesting sites impacted by sand removal, development and tourism. Entanglement in fishing nets and water pollution are further threats. Small numbers of captive-bred juveniles occur in the global pet trade.</p>","<p>Historically <em>Pelochelys cantorii </em>may have been locally common (Cantor 1848, Straits of Malacca), but in recent decades is usually described as “widespread but nowhere abundant” (Moll 1985).<br/><br/>In Bangladesh <em>P. cantorii </em>is considered Critically Endangered, with very few animals seen any longer (P.

It is now considered Critically Endangered on the China National Red List. Records of the occurrence on the mainland of southern China are complicated by confusion with <em>Rafetus swinhoei</em>.<br/><br/>In India, Das (1991) noted the species as not uncommon in Orissa, but had been practically eliminated by 2000 (Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). Participants at the 2005 Lucknow Red List Workshop agreed that the species was nearly extinct in southern India, and Critically Endangered and headed for extinction in India overall. Very few specimens have been found on surveys or in markets in recent years (Participants Singapore Red List Workshop 2011). Very few specimens have been found in recent years.<br/><br/>In Thailand, populations have disappeared from the Mae Klong and Chao Phraya river basins, and the species is restricted to remnant populations in the Peninsula (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995), where its situation appears relatively stable (Kitimasak pers. comm. at Singapore Red List Workshop 2011). There are now no known nesting sites in Viet Nam (B. Horne pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Very few animals have been seen in trade in Viet Nam since monitoring started in the 1990s (T.

Guntoro pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>No reliable data exists for this species in Malaysia, a few specimens are still found (Chan pers. comm. at Singapore Red List Workshop 2011). No data exists for this species in Myanmar. There are no recent records from Singapore or Brunei Darussalam. Occurrence in the Philippines is vouchered by very few specimens over the past 150 years (Taylor 1921).<br/><br/>Over its entire range the population of <em>P. cantorii</em> is suspected to have reduced by at least 80% in the last three generations (30 years), and this decline is predicted to continue.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pelochelys cantorii</em> is widespread, with localised occurrences in lowland rivers and estuaries from southern and eastern India and Bangladesh. through Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia (Peninsula, Sarawak, Sabah), Singapore (extinct), Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, southern China, the Philippines (where widespread), and Indonesia (Sumatra, Kalimantan) (Iverson 1992, Das 1995, Webb 1995).

It is listed as Least Concern.","<em>Sparus aurata</em> is a coastal species, inhabiting seagrass beds, sandy bottoms, and the surf zone. It is commonly found at depths to about 30 m, but the adults may occur as deep as 150 m. <em>Sparus aurata </em>is a&#160;euryhaline species and enters brackish waters. This species has reduced home ranges and shows site fidelity when displaced (Abecassis and Erzini 2008) &#160;and may be solitary or form small aggregations. It is mainly carnivorous, feeding on molluscs, particularly mussels which it can easily crush, crustaceans and fish, though it is accessorily herbivorous (Carpenter in press).&#160;<br/><br/>This is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Sexual maturity develops in males at two years of age (20–30 cm) and in females at two to three years (33–40 cm). Females are batch spawners and an lay 20,000–80,000 eggs every day for a period up to four months. In captivity, sex change is conditioned by social and hormonal factors (Colloca and Cerasi 2009). Spawning generally occurs from October to December, with sequenced spawning during the whole period. Incubation of the eggs lasts about two days at 16–17°C, and the larval stage lasts about 50 days at 17.5°C or about 43 days at 20°C. Egg size is 0.9–1.1 mm and larval length at hatching is 2.5–3.0 mm.<br/><br/>The parameters of the Von Bertalanffy growth equation for this species are: L<sub>inf</sub> = 55.33 cm, K = 0.513, t<sub>0</sub> = - 0.282 (Chaoui <em>et al</em>. 2006); L<sub>inf</sub> = 62 cm, K = 0.221, t<sub>0</sub> = - 0.774 (Lasserre and Labourg 1974); and L<sub>inf</sub> = 59.76 cm, K = 0.153, t<sub>0</sub> = - 0.711 (Kraljevic and Dulcic 1997).

Catch statistics indicate a slow and steady increase for the Mediterranean from 1950 to the mid-1980s. Thereafter, there was a rapid increase from several hundred tonnes to over 90,000 tonnes. This increase in catch landings may be partly due to the wild capture of escapee fish from aquaculture sea cages, but most likely because the aquaculture production figures are not adequately separated from the wild caught fish catch figures in the Mediterranean fisheries statistics (D. Pollard pers. comm. 2009).<br/><br/><em>Sparus aurata</em>&#160;is common outside sea-cage forms in the Turkish Aegean Sea feeding on the feed (pellets) and accounted for 0.7% of the total weight of one fish farm from 2004–2008&#160;(Akyol and Ertosluk 2010).<br/><br/>Most aquaculture production (128,943 t in 2008 according to the Federation of European Aquaculture Producers (FEAP)) occurs in the Mediterranean, with Greece (49%) being by far the largest producer in 2002. Turkey (15%), Spain (14%) and Italy (6%) are also major Mediterranean producers. In addition, considerable production occurs in Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Malta, Morocco, Portugal and Tunisia.

Sexual maturity is reached in the first year of life, and this species is ovuliparous and in the natural environment the schools spawn in clean and calm waters with rocky bottoms.<br/><em>Rhamdia quelen</em> is known to be an intermediary host of the trematode <em>Clinostomum</em> sp. (Fortes and Hoffmann 1980). The courtship behaviour of this species involves the male circling around the female, with the circulation becoming closer at the time of ovulation, proceeding the male to press the flanks of the female to activate her ovulation.","<em>Rhamdia quelen </em>is threatened by the herbicides, fungicides and pesticides pollution run off from the agriculture industry of rice, soybean, corn and wheat production, as as well as&#160;some pesticides might be added directly to water to control macrophytes and predatory insects (Szarek <em>et al</em>., 2000; Van Der Oost, <em>et al.,</em>&#160;2003).

Off the coast of Ghana, this species was characteristic of the assemblage of fishes found to depths of 40 m over soft bottoms (Koranteng 2001). In Brazil, it was found in the Curuçá River Estuary, northeastern Amazonian Coast during the rainy and dry season (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2011), a mostly marine estuary. It is usually found alone or in small, loose aggregates.  Adults are pelagic, but are typically found near continental margins. Juveniles are commonly found on coastal and offshore banks (Robins and Ray 1986), and it is thought that this species utilizes estuaries as a nursery area (Denadai <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). The diet of&#160;<em>L. laevigatus</em>&#160;consists mainly of, in order of frequency of occurrence, the sea whip&#160;<em>Leptogorgia setacea</em>, followed by various crustaceans, teleosts and amphipods. Lesser utilized food options for&#160;<em>Lagocephalus laevigatus</em>&#160;include polychaetes, bivalves, algae, gastropods and isopods, all of which comprise&#160;very small volumes in the puffer diet (polychaetes, bivalves, algae, gastropods and isopods comprise &gt; 5% in their total food intake). Considering the volume of the items ingested by<em>&#160;L. laevigatus,</em>&#160;the sea whip&#160;<em>L. setacea&#160;</em>is&#160;most consumed, followed, with much less importance, by fish, amphipods and unidentified crustaceans (Denadai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). The toxicity of the smooth puffer may be derived by the Cnidaria that it ingests (Denadai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Life history and reproduction</strong><br/>In Brazil,&#160;<em>Lagocephalus laevigatus&#160;</em>probably&#160;spawns from August through November (i.e. the end of winter and beginning of Spring). There tends to be more males than females in wild populations (Fall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The length of first maturity for males is 24.5 cm and for females is 27.5 cm (Fall&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Off the coast of Senegal, there are two spawning periods: The first during the hot and rainy season (July to October), and the second during the dry and cold season (December to January).

They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012).

It is worth noting that Tetraodontids in general were considered undesirable in the region until the late 1970s and 1980s, and only began to be utilized as food sources as other species (groupers, breams, barracudas,&#160;snappers, etc.) became rare.

This species<em> </em>shows intermediate tolerance to the environmental conditions that prevailed in the Lerma River basin at the end of the eighties, with the following tolerance intervals: temperature of 13-28 ° C, concentration of dissolved oxygen from 2.4 to 15 mg/l, turbidity from undetectable (ND) to 600 UFT, suspended solids ND-580 mg/l, pH from 6.3 to 9.4, hardness from 19 to 280 mg/l of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, sulfates ND-170, phosphates ND-6.0 and nitrates ND-35.2 (Díaz-Pardo <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993).","<p>The main threats facing the ichthyofauna of the Lerma river basin are associated with pollution (urban, industrial, agricultural, livestock and mining), the construction of hydraulic works, the extraction of water. In the particular case of lake species, pollution, siltation, drying, overfishing and introduction of invasive species are the main factors that explain the decline of their populations (Díaz-Pardo <em>et al.</em>&#160;1993, Soto-Galera <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998).<br/><br/>The species is of potential use for aquaculture, given that it is a member of the genus that is the main animal protein source in these regions since pre-Hispanic times, leading to a threat of overfishing. This species is also threatened by pollution, sedimentation in addition to the subsequent drying and hypereutrophication of its lake and river habitats. An example of such is the city of Morelia located along the middle reaches of the Río Grande de Morelia (Soto-Galera <em>et al</em>. 1999). The city of Morelia is growing rapidly and is a major commercial, industrial and agricultural centre, that discharges large amounts of largely untreated wastes into the river, as well as surrounding forests being cut down to expand agriculture, leading to soil erosion (Soto-Galera <em>et al</em>. 1999). The combinations of these problems and the inadequate management of procedures have led to reductions in the amount and quality of tributary inputs, leading to a reduction in species number and losses from the Río Grande de Morelia (Soto-Galera <em>et al</em>. 1999).</p>","Habitat alteration had reduced the range of distribution and led to the local extinction of the species in some basins. During the Miocene these basins were connected, allowing dispersal and colonization of new hydrological systems. Later on, tectonic, volcanic and climatic events of the Plio-Pleistocene promoted continuous periods of isolation and re-connection, allowing the species evolve through continuous cycles of expansion and contraction of its distribution. Therefore, it is expected that these events have left signals in the geographical distribution and genetic diversity and divergence of existing populations. Although the analysis of genetic diversity and genetic structure in the population becomes an important factor for the conservation of a species, few studies have been made in this taxon (Rosa<em> et al</em>. 2015). <br/><br/>A population decline has been observed in the Rio Lerma Basin, Lago de Cuitzeo-Rio Grande de Morelia basin of Michoacan and Guanajuato in Central Mexico (Soto-Galera<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1999). Additionally, a decline has been inferred due to a reduction in the extent/quality of its natural habitat in the Valley of Mexico (Álvarez del Villar and Navarro 1957). The collection records show a clear increase in the number of <em>C. humboldtianum</em> records in the Lerma river basin, as a result of their establishment during the last decades of the last century in various artificial reservoirs (Díaz-Pardo <em>et al.</em>&#160;1993, Soto-Galera and Alcántara-Soria 2016). Many of these populations are numerous and sustain fisheries, as would be the case of the dams: del Bosque and Tepuxtec in Michoacán; Villa Victoria and Huapango in the State of Mexico and Requena in Hidalgo (SAGARPA 2004, Soto-Galera and Alcántara-Soria 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Chirostoma humboldtianum </em>is a <span>benthopelagic&#160;endemic freshwater fish<span> species widely distributed in isolated basins of Central Mexico.

1998108,191692,Alloophorus robustus,Vulnerable,"B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv)+2ab(i,ii,iii,iv)",2019,2018-04-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bulldog Splitfin is difficult to find and very shy. It was historically distributed over a large area in Mexico, reaching from the Chapala lake in the west to the Río Laja in the east. Throughout the decades, it disappeared from many of the big lakes and dams and has reduced in numbers where it once was common. In the Pátzcuaro lake, it was an important part of the hauls of the local people, but due to low population numbers, it is no longer used for consumption. Different threats, often specific for certain habitats, eliminated the species or led to a decrease in numbers. Predation by Black Bass extirpated <em>Alloophorus robustus </em>from the Zirahuén lake, while competition from&#160;<em>Xiphophorus variatus</em>&#160;occurred in Río Laja. Water pollution was the reason for the disappearance of the species from the Chapala lake and Río Grande de Santiago, also causing very low numbers in the Pátzcuaro lake. Only three out of nine original subpopulations now exist. <br/><br/>With our state of knowledge (the two lineages of the Bulldog Splitfin might be seen as separate species in the future), the worst case scenario for AOO (112 km<sup>2</sup>) meets the threshold for Endangered (500 km<sup>2</sup>), while the EOO (11,400 km<sup>2</sup>) meets the threshold for Vulnerable (20,000 km<sup>2</sup>). Finally, considering the number of locations (8), the above mentioned threats, severe declines in AOO, EOO, locations and subpopulations along with quality of habitats, the Bulldog Splitfin is assessed Vulnerable.&#160; &#160; <br/> <em></em>","Though the Bulldog Splitfin has a historically large distribution, although the species is not common. It lives concealed in vegetation and waits for prey of mainly small fish, crayfish, shrimps, tadpoles and larges invertebrates. <em>Alloophorus robustus</em> is a predatory species; it is quite aggressive as a juvenile of just a few centimetres in length, but bigger individuals seem to be more placid. The habitats of this species vary, encompassing ponds and lakes of different sizes, in addition to springs, channels, creeks and rivers, as long as there is submersed vegetation, reeds or shaded areas between roots of trees. The following passages describe some of the habitats where this species occurs, but it is generally thought to be rare. <br/><br/>La Mintzita is a marshy spring–fed lake of about 80 m diameter that drains       into the Río Grande de Morelia and hence into the Lago Cuitzeo. The Río Grande de Morelia/Cuitzeo basin is endorheic, although its       fauna indicates that it was once connected to the adjacent Río Lerma       basin. Most of the Río       Grande de Morelia/Cuitzeo system has been greatly degraded, and La       Mintzita is one of the last remaining high-quality sites in the basin. A few hundred metres below the lake the outlet canal receives       waste from a large paper mill (Bio Papel Scribe S.A. de C.V.) and no longer has the capability to support       fish life, so La Mintzita is isolated from other fish populations in the       basin. Lyons<em>&#160;</em>(2004) sampled the outlet canal just below the lake with a       backpack  electroshocker and the lake itself just above the outlet with a        seine. The canal was about       8 m wide and 0.5 - 1 m deep with a  fast strong current and gravel bottom. In 80 m of sampling, they collected the following Goodeids: 3 <em>Alloophrous       robustus</em>, 30 <em>Goodea atripinnis</em>,       about 100 <em>Xenotoca </em>cf. <em>variata</em>, 5 <em>Skiffia       lermae</em>, and about 15 <em>Zoogoneticus       quitzeoensis</em>. They also       caught 10 <em>Poeciliopsis infans</em> (Poeciliidae; native) and about 25 <em>Xiphophorus       helleri</em> (an exotic Poeciliid), plus 10 <em>Yuriria       alta</em> (Cyprinidae; native) and 10 <em>Scartomyzon       austrinus</em>. They then pulled       the seine over about 300 m<sup>2</sup>  in the lake, which       averaged about 1 m deep with a sand and clay  bottom and clear water at       15-19 °C temperature. They captured 3  <em>A. robustus</em>, 5 <em>G. atripinnis</em>,       30 <em>X. </em>cf. <em>variata</em>, about 100 <em>S.       lermae</em>, 3 <em>Z. quitzeoensis</em>, plus at least 1,000 <em>P. infans</em>, 5 <em>X. helleri</em>,       and 30 <em>Y. alta</em> (Lyons&#160;2004).<br/><br/>The spring in Chapultepec, Lago de Pátzcuaro drainage, is egg shaped and fenced in with two  effluents, one on the south end, one on the west end. The size is  approximately 100 x 50 m, the depth from observations outside of the  fence is at least 1.5 m. The effluents are channels from about 80 cm (south-channel) to  more than 1 m (west-channel) width. Both channels have a sandy ground with  gravel and several rocks on the borders. In recent years (2014-2017),  submerse vegetation in the channels occurred in form of some floating  water hyacinths directly after the outlet in the south and areas with dense<em> Egeria</em>  sp. stocks. Grassy riparian vegetation covered the borders and hang  over the surface, the west-channel was partly covered by trees. At the west-outlet, some exotic <em>Zantedeschia</em> sp. grew along with the borders and shaded it partly. This part of the channel was densely planted with<em> Egeria</em>  and deep to 1 m. After 120 m from the outlet, it is dammed, leaving the  subsequent part of the channel with a varying depth between 15 and 40 cm.  The current in both channels was fast to moderate, the water looked  characteristic milky blue, probably due to some dissolved minerals. The  vegetation in the spring itself was composed of <em>Egeria</em> sp. and <em>Potamogeton</em>  sp. The water parametres taken in March 2017 were: water temperaturea 19.5°C; pH, 7.22; conductivity, 1,180 μS. Only a single juvenile male was found in the west channel during a survey by Köck<em> et al.</em> in 2017, and two individuals during a survey by Lyons <em>et al.</em> in 2014 at the same place; other fish species recorded were <em>Allotoca diazi</em>, <em>Goodea atripinnis</em>, <em>Skiffia lermae </em>and<em>&#160;</em><em>Allotoca dugesii</em>. A survey by Mexican students in 2018 was not successful in finding any <em>Alloophorus</em>. <br/><br/>The Cuitzeo lake is the oldest and second largest Mexican lake and covers an area of about 500 km<sup>2</sup> including the marshy grass surrounding it. It is irregular shaped with northern, western an eastern sections, connected by marshland in the middle. The western section is divided into an east and a west part by two north-south dams, built for HW's 43 and 43B. The lake is astatic and very shallow (about 0.5 m deep), consisting of muddy ground with murky water. In dry years, the western part of the west section is isolated completely from the east part by closing the passages under the roads to save the west section from drying up completely. With this method, at least the east part of the west section keeps water. The lake is surrounded by partly dense and large reed areas. In one reed area directly at the HW43B dam, Köck <em>et al.</em> collected a juvenile male on a survey in November 2014 (wet season).<br/><br/>The Presa Verduzco or Presa de La Luz east of Jacona de Plancarte is shaped like a cake slice with the effluent in the sharp angle in the north. The circular arc has a length of about 400 m, the radius a varying length between 210 and 280 m. The arc is mainly bordered with reeds and trees, providing some small coves and reed islands. In one of the coves under riparian vegetation, Köck <em>et al.</em> collected a group of young fish about 3 cm long on a survey in 2016. The ground of the Presa is made of sand, gravel and silt, with parts showing bigger rocks and stones. The ground of the reed-areas is mainly made of silt, sand and mud.","The Bulldog Splitfins suffers from different threats and, in some cases, threat scenarios are typical for a certain habitat, like the total loss of the species from the Zirahuén basin by predation and competition though non-native Black Bass species (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em> and<em> punctulatus</em>). <br/><br/>The main threats to the type subpopulation (Lago de Pátzcuaro subpopulation) are water pollution  and urban development in the area, including expanding tourism, and  exposed exotic fish species since the early 1930's. Introduction of Black bass (<em style="""">Micropterus</em><em style="""">&#160;salmoides</em>) in 1933, and Common carp (<em style="""">Cyprinus carpio</em>) and Tilapia (<em style="""">Oreochromis niloticus</em>)  since the 1970's, has almost completely eliminated the species from the lake. The common water  hyazinth is also a threat; by covering the surface it reduces the flow of the channels and interferes with gas exchange. Additionally, as a carnivorous  species, increasing turbidity of the habitats reduces chances to  find food, especially for fry (Hernández-Chávez&#160;<em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2014, for <em style="""">Allotoca catarinae</em>). It's estimated that the water infiltration rate for Humedales del Lago de Pátzcuaro has been reduced from 12% to 8%, but assuming the potential presence of  a new period of dry years in the region, the hydraulic contribution of  the basin will be critical to maintain the balance of the water level.  In addition, erosion and loss of the soil will carry on as the basin  continues its process of ecological deterioration; this is expected to cause greater reduction in the water entry into the lake due due to the  decrease in the infiltration rate and the lack of recharge of surface  aquifers. Its waters, exploited since pre-Columbian times, are also  effected by the use of surrounding land for agricultural activity. This covers  just over 40% of the basin and approximately 30% of the total area consists of grasslands used by cattle and horses. The Río Angulo subpopulation also suffers from common carp competition and increasing sedimentation of the Lago Zacapú. Water pollution, increasing turbidity and urban development threatens the Río Cupatitzio subpopulation in and south of Uruapán<em>. </em>Additional threats come from a trout farm in Uruapán that might impact the native fish via escaped carp. These three subpopulations have to be regarded as Critically Endangered: the Laguna de Zirahuén subpopulation&#160;due to Black Bass, the Laguna Yuriría subpopulation&#160;through water pollution and the Middle Río Lerma subpopulation (by severe water pollution everywhere and competition through non-native<em style=""""> Xiphophorus variatus</em> in the Río Laja) may even be Possibly Extinct. The threats to the Río Grande de Morelia subpopulation vary by location. The Lago Cuitzeo stock is threatened by pollution, nutrients, sedimentation and severe droughts, which increase predation by waterbirds, including American white Pelicans (<em style="""">Pelecanus erythrorhynchos</em>) that overwinter here from the United States. The areas providing water for the lake, such as La Mintzita spring and Presa Cointzio dam are not effected by droughts or visited by bigger birds. Pollution, urban sewage, water extraction for human consumption, nutrients and non-native fish are threats to these stocks. La Mintzita  remains in good condition, but its future is uncertain.         Settlement and use of the       adjacent lands around the lake have   increased in the last 10 years, as has       runoff of domestic wastes   into the lake. More ominously, the city of Morelia is considering   pumping water       from the lake for municipal uses, which could   reduce the lake level and       perhaps even eliminate the springs that   feed the lake, destroying       this unique habitat. This subpopulation has to be regarded Endangered. The Lago de Chapala/Río Grande de Santiago subpopulation is almost completely gone due to reduction in habitat quality. The only known extant stock inhabits the isolated Lagos Los Negritos east of the Chapala lake, covering an area of approximately 0.3 km<sup>2</sup>. The fish are threatened by habitat loss, agricultural influences, non-native fish competition (<em style="""">Lepomis</em> sp.) and recreational activity. Samples in 2017 were not successful. This subpopulation is regarded Critically Endangered. The Cotija subpopulation is threatened by agriculture, sedimentation, habitat loss, competition through non-native fish, urban sewage, human activities. The Río Duero subpopulation has been partly affected by Black Bass introduction (Lago de Camécuaro), partly by competition through non-native fish (<em style="""">Xiphophorus hellerii</em>, <em style="""">Poecilia mexicana</em>), through pollution, urban sewage, urban development and habitat loss. Due to at least two habitats in each subpopulation, they are regarded Endangered. <em></em><em style=""""><br/></em><em><br/></em>","In contrary to other bigger species of Goodeids - like<em> Goodea atripinnis</em> or <em>Chapalichthys</em> spp. - it is hard to gain information on population status and development of <em>Alloophorus robustus</em>, mainly because of its secret way of life. As an ambush predator, hunting mainly at dusk and dawn (at least from obersvation in aquariums), it is often hidden at daytime and derived from aquarium observations shy and cautious. Nevertheless, some statements can be made taking in consideration fishery information. So was the Bulldog Splitfin once a species targeted by fishermen due to its size and obviously also due to its number. Reports from the development of fish populations in the Pátzcuaro lake talk about descreasing stocks the way stocks of Tilapia and common carp increased since the 1970's. Additionally, looking at the situation within the Zirahuén lake and the spring in San Francisco del Rincón, where this species has been extirpated by Black Bass, a reduction of the Bulldog Splitfn stocks by Black Bass being introduced in the Pátzcuaro lake in 1933 (but becoming extinct again) can be inferred. So despite of the size, the Bulldog Splitfins seems to be not able to compete with <em>Micropterus</em> spp. Even smaller non-native species, but being competitors for prey, might be a problem, <em>Alloophorus</em> is not able to solve. So the introduction of <em>Xiphophorus variatus</em>, a Platyfish, in dams along the Río Laja, seems to had a dramatic impact on the local Bulldog Splitfin population, which became extirpated (Lyons 2011). Finally can be said, that the population of <em>Alloophorus robustus</em> shrinked dramatically, and it is sometimes entirely gone from bigger lakes, but also with decreasing numbers in other habitats known to be strongholds. The situation of the different subpopulations and their status is illustrated under ""Threats"".<br/> <br/>Another factor might have a big influence on the threat status of the population in the future: Phylogenetic studies gave a hint, that the Bulldog Splitfin might be comprised by two species with the original <em>Alloophorus robustus</em> being originally distributed from the Río Turbio system, a northern Río Lerma affluent, and the Río Angulo drainage S of the Lerma river eastwards. Then the second species by contrast would have been distributed from the Río Duero drainage westwards, including the Chapala-Río Grande de Santiago system and the Río Balsas headwaters. In that case, the reduction of AOO, EOO and number of locations simply by splitting in two species would directly lead to an upgrading of the threat status of both species.",Decreasing,"The Bulldog Splitfin belongs to a few Goodeid species with a large distribution range. It is historically known from the federal states of Guanajuato, Jalisco and Michoacán and occured at the type location, the endorheic Lago de Pátzcuaro, with surrounding springs and tributaries, the adjacent endorheic Laguna de Zirahuén including the Estanque Las Condembas (Lago de Opopeo), and the likewise endorheic Río Grande de Morelia basin with the Lago Cuitzeo,&#160;several springs of the Río Grande de Morelia, the Presa Cointzio, the&#160;Laguna de Yuriría and several affluents of the Cuitzeo lake. The historical range also includes the ríos San Antonio&#160;(Río Santa Bárbara) and Cupatitzio in Uruapán, Río Balsas drainage, the Río Angulo drainage with the Lago Zacapú, and several northern tributaries of the middle Río Lerma like the ríos Laja, Turbio and Guanajuato. More collection sites are known from the Río Duero drainage (a lower Río Lerma affluent) including several spring areas (Presas Orandino and Verduzco), the Lago de Chapala with the isolated Lagos Los Negritos east of the lake and subsequent sections of the Río Grande de Santiago, and finally the Presa San Juanico and other habitats in the Río Grande&#160;headwaters in the Cotija region, Río Balsas drainage.&#160;<br/><br/>Lyons (2011) reported that this species disappeared from the Lago de Chapala, the adjacent Río Grande de Santiago and the Río Lerma and most of its tributaries. It no longer inhabits the Laguna de Yuriría and lost its last stronghold north of the Río Lerma in a spring in San Francisco del Rincón; as a result, there are potentially no remaining habitats in the states of Jalisco and Guanajuato (except for northern shores of the Cuitzeo lake). It has become rare in many other habitats; larger stocks can only be found in some springs of the Río Duero drainage, the spring at the Molino Viejo de Chapultepec (Lago de Pátzcuaro drainage), the Lago Zacapú and the La Mintzita spring (Río Grande de Morelia drainage).<br/><br/>In 2008, the Bulldog Splitfin was estimated to have disappeared from more than the 50% of its historical range (Domínguez-Domínguez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>The river and lake names above are officially used by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (http://antares.inegi.org.mx); nevertheless, other names may be used more often or better known and therefore preferred.","The species was targeted by local commercial fisheries in Lake Pátzcuaro but, due to increasing stocks of <em>Oreochormis niloticus </em>and Common carps causing competition, it almost completely disappeared from the lake. It is no longer used for consumption and is not a target species for the ornamental fish trade. <em></em>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The conservation efforts for the Bulldog Splitfin concentrate on Ramsar Sites, with the hope of a positive effect on species inhabiting these sites. However, there are no conservation plans for native fish in these areas, so the successes are negligible. The <em>Alloophorus robustus - </em>fishing has been included under the  sustainable fisheries regulation for Lake Pátzcuaro approved in 2015  (Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-036-SAG/PESC-2015: Pesca responsable en el  Lago de Pátzcuaro ubicado en el Estado de Michoacán. Especificaciones  para el aprovechamiento de los recursos pesqueros.). Anyway, due to ongoing competition through common carps and Tilapia, and due to predation by Black Bass in historical time, the species has disappeared from the lake almost entirely and plays therefore no more a role in consumption and fisheries. <br/><br/>Humedales del Lago de Pátzcuaro within&#160;the Pátzcuaro lake, is surrounded  by mountains and rugged topography with a steep slopes. The lake is an endorheic and  eutrophic system, meaning it has no outlet to the sea and is shallow  and turbid, with a high concentration of nutrients. In the southern area  of ​​the lake from Pátzcuaro, there is an average annual water  temperature of 19.2 °C and a total alkalinity of 165 mg/l. As a closed system without significant  tributaries, this lake may be more sensitive to hydraulic imbalance, with the  annual volume variations being mainly determined by the precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface runoff and infiltration water through internal springs. It is also occasionally fed by  temporary surface streams during the rainy season, such as the San  Gregorio rivers and the Santa Fe and Soto streams in the north. In the  extreme southwest it receives water from agricultural discharges of the Chapultepec channel (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1447, 2005).<br/><br/>La Mintzita is a reservoir formed  by a series of springs. The site is home to species that are protected  under Mexican legislation, some of which are threatened, such as&#160;the <em>Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis </em>and&#160;<em>Skiffia&#160;lermae</em>.&#160;The site counts more than a hundred bird species, including&#160;<em>Anas platyrhynchos diazi </em>and&#160;<em>Bubo virginianus</em>, in addition to the endangered <em>Buteo jamaicensis&#160;</em>and <em>Regulus calendula</em>.  This wetland plays an important role in the retention of sediments from higher altitudes of the catchment area, as well as filtering nutrients produced in the Cointzio Resort. Threats to this Ramsar Site,  such as the overuse of water resources, illegal domestic drainage, the  deforestation of the gallery forests and human encroachment activities should be regulated once the Management Programme for  the State Protected Area is finalized. The area is already designated as  a Zone Subject to Ecological Preservation and a management plan is  currently being prepared to regulate, limit and sanction illegal  activities. The plan is expected to be finalized by the end of 2010 (Ramsar Site No.1919. Most recent RIS information: 2009).<br/><br/>The Lago Zacapú is fed by approximately 20 cold water springs (19 °C),  which emerge at the southwestern end of the valley of Zacapú, some of  which are used for human consumption and recreation (Ramsar Secretariat,  Site No.1465, 2004). Due to the confluence of fish species,  migratory birds, plants and endemic amphibians (<em>Ambystoma andersoni</em>),  it can be considered as a broad transitional zone, giving it great  ecological importance. The two main sections of Lago Zacapú differ: one has depths of between 4 to 6 m, and the other ranges from 12 to 90 m deep,  bedded by soils and alluvium (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1465, 2004).<p>There is an ongoing monitoring and <em>ex-situ</em> breeding project run by the Laboratorio de Biología Aucatica in Michoacan University, Morelia, Mexico</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Unlike other cave fish species, although it can live in complete darkeness&#160;<em>Poecilia mexicana</em>&#160;still has functional eyes which are thought to be linked to sexual preference choice, with large males favoured by females (Bisazza and Pilastro, 1997) given they are superior in dyadic conflicts as well (Ribowski and Franck, 1993). With both female choice and male competition, it results in selection for larger male body sizes and so small males compensate by using alternative mating tactics (Farr, 1989). Poecilia mexicana mature males can range from 18 mm to more than 70 mm (Menzel and Darnell, 1973), with male growth rate after maturity dropping to almost zero, meaning they cannot move between size classes.

In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. bimaculatus</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</span><br/>Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005).","<span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu bimaculatus</span> is most closely related to<span style=""font-style: italic;""> T. flavidus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).

The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. snyderi</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. chinensis</span>, and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. porphyreus</span>.

In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger  puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases  (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. bimaculatus,</em>&#160;however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. bimaculatus</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines.

As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

It is found in the Yellow, Bohai, and East China Seas. It is a coastal species which is found at depths ranging from 10 to 135 m. This species is dependent on estuaries for spawning. Juveniles mature in estuaries and migrate offshore to spawn.<em> Takifugu rubripes</em> is a highly prized food fish in Japan with a high retail value. Population declines which have been attributed to the use of highly-effective fishing gear have been recorded in parts of its range, however range-wide information is currently not available. Available landing information from Japan indicates landings have declined to about 5% of their historical peak from 1987 to 2004. Stocks in the Seto Inland Sea have failed to recover from historical declines resulting from excessive fishing effort and a decline in anchovy stocks. Due to declining stocks, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005. This plan set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is aquacultured in large quantities in order to meet consumer demand, however wild-caught <em>T. rubripes</em> remain highly valued. Stock enhancement programs using aquacultured<em> T. rubripes</em> are in place, however the efficacy of these programs is unknown and mortality in aquaculture is high due to parasitic diseases, which may become introduced into wild populations. Genetic diversity is maintained in both wild populations but is decreased in cultured populations, which may reduce the overall fitness of this species. Available information suggests that <em>T. rubripes</em> has undergone significant population declines in parts of its range. As a highly-valued foodfish the persistence of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em> is highly dependent on species-specific regulatory measures including an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, mandated release of small fishes, and aquacultured fish to meet increasing consumer demand. Therefore, it is considered Conservation Dependent and is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened.","<strong>Habitat and depth distribution<br/></strong><em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is a demersal species. Adults are found in inlet waters, occasionally entering brackish waters.  Fingerlings are often seen in brackish river mouths (Kato<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005) and can tolerate salinities ranging from 25%–100% of that of seawater (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2005). Immature <em>T. rubripes</em> are found in the area between the Seto Inland Sea and the Japanese coast, and they move from the open sea prior to becoming adult fish.&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em>&#160;is unable to live deeper than 150 meters and prefers depths of 100 to 135 meters and above on the continental shelf in the western Enshu Nada (Achiha 2006).&#160;Electronic tagging was used to examine the ecology of this species, and revealed a typical diurnal change in swimming depth with seasonal variations. In winter, this species generally occupies the upper 10 m of the water column, and dives to depths reaching 90 m. In autumn the main swimming layer ranged from the surface to the upper 30 m of the water column (Nakajima 2001). This species exhibits burrowing behaviour.<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction and Life History<br/></strong>The age of first maturity has been estimated at two to three years (Yu 2003,&#160;K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Longevity is estimated at nine years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).&#160;The results of tagging experiments indicate that adult <em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea migrate to coastal areas in western Japan to spawn. After spawning, the puffer seems to migrate again to the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, and to the Gulf of Bohai (Tagawa 1996). <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> returns to the same spawning ground and strongly shows homing behaviour to its natal spawning grounds (Nakajima and Akira 2005).&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em> moves offshore with growth and breeds in the sea (Kato<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005) from March to May. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> spawns demersal eggs which hatch in four to ten days (Sato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). Juveniles mature in shallow bays and river mouths for one year, and then migrate permanently to the open ocean (Kato <em>et al.</em> 2010). Juveniles resemble <em>T. niphobles</em> (Masuda <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Generation length calculation</strong><br/>The generation length of <em>T. rubripes</em> has been estimated using the following formula: A<sub>m</sub> + ((A<sub>max</sub> - A<sub>m</sub>)/2), where&#160;A<sub>m </sub>= age at maturity and A<sub>max </sub>= longevity. The estimated generation length of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 5.75 years.<br/><br/><strong>Toxicity<br/></strong>This species bioaccumulates tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Noguchi <em>et al.</em> 2006). The liver and ovaries are highly toxic, the intestines slightly toxic and the  flesh, skin and testes are innocuous (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/><strong><em>Takifugu</em> and Tetraodontidae<br/></strong>As one of the first vertebrates whose genome has been completely sequenced,&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;has become a model organism for genomics studies (Aparicio&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002).&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes&#160;</em>is morphologically similar to&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. pseudommus</span>, and a number of genome-level molecular studies suggest that they are the same species (Cui&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005), differing only in the color of the anal fin.

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes.

However, this is not likely to relieve the pressure placed on wild stocks, as fished torafugu is preferred to cultured torafugu and commands a higher price. Additionally, cage aquaculture of <em>T. rubripes</em> is often plagued with high mortality due to outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Kikuch 2006)</p><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""referenceText""><span id=""ref_bib4""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata<em> et al</em>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar<em> et al</em>. 1991). Fishes of the genus<em> Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of<em> Takifugu </em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu</em> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant. Japan actively enhances the stock of <em>T. rubripe</em>s. In 1994, Japan produced 2344 x 10<sup>3</sup>&#160;fingerlings, 1722 x 10<sup>3&#160;</sup>of which were released.<br/><br/><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and overfishing</strong><br/>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","<strong>Population structure<br/></strong>Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;revealed that the genetic differences between&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. pseudommus</em>,&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>basilevskiannus</em>, and&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species&#160;<em>T.</em><em>&#160;rubripes</em><em></em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<em>Takifugu chinensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. pseudommus&#160;</em>were previously proposed to belong to the same species as&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;based on analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Song&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Reza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Local populations in Nagasaki, Japan, have been identified by IUCN as threatened at the population level due to this over-exploitation. Additionally stocks in the Seto Insland Sea have failed to recover from historical declines resulting from excessive fishing effort and declining anchovy stocks, which formed a key component of this species' diet (Nagai 2003). Several reasons have been given to account for declining populations of targeted Fugu species. <em>T. rubripe</em>s is primarily captured by long-line. Long-line fishing, which is a particularly effective method of catching this species, has become widespread with the advent of modified, low-cost, easy-to-use long lines. Large numbers of sexually immature Fugu have been caught, and <em>T. rubripes</em> between year one and two, which are reputed to taste better, are most heavily targeted, which has resulted in recruitment over-fishing for <em>T. rubripes</em> and other targeted Fugu species (Nagai 2003).&#160;Prior to 1999, the prevalence of foreign fishing vessels in open seas resulted in the capture and discard of large numbers of <em>T. rubripes</em>.<br/><br/>There are population declines in parts of its range from harvesting, however this is not inferred to reach thresholds for a threatened category (K.

It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu</em> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><br/>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin<em> et al</em>. 2005).","<em><em>Takifugu reticularis</em> </em><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">is rare in Chinese waters (Liu and Liu pers. comm. 2011).<em><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""> </span></em>It has been recorded as a stray in Japan, and<em> </em>was the least abundant tetraodontid caught in a nearshore surf-zone environment in Southern Japan (Suda <em>et al.</em> 2004, Inoue <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;<br/></span><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><br/><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>      <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

Partitioning of food resources enables <em>S. spengleri </em>to coexist with <em>S. testudineus</em> (Targett 1978). Food partitioning also allows<em> S. spengleri </em>to coexist with <em>S. dorsalis</em>—<em>S. spengleri</em>&#160;feeds primarily on amphipods at all size classes, while <em>S. dorsalis</em>'s diet changes from primarily amphipods as juveniles to primarily pagurid hermit crabs as adults (Gathof 1981).<br/><br/>The toxicity of the skin and viscera of <em>S. spengleri</em> has been confirmed, and it may be one of the most toxic species found in Atlantic waters (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2003).

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> revealed that the genetic differences between  <em>T. </em><em>orbimaculatus</em>, <em>T. </em><em>coronoidus</em>, <em>T.</em> <em>fasciatus</em><em></em>, and <em>T. </em><em>obscurus</em> are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species <em>T.</em><em> coronoidus</em><em></em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue <em>et al.</em> 2009). <span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times, <em>Takifugu</em>  interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization  in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita  1967, Masuda <em>et al.</em> 1991, Miyaki <em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Each&#160;combination of <em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><em><br/>Takifugu coronoidus</em> is a rare species throughout its distribution in China. <em>Takifugu&#160;coronoidus</em>&#160;was not found in a search of available museum collection databases (Accessed through the Fishnet2 Portal, www.fishnet2.org, 2014-06-14).<span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu coronoidus</span> is found off the coast of China in the lower reaches and mouths of rivers such as the Chongming (Shanghai), Shazhou, Haimen and Nantong (Jiangsu), down to southern Guangdong Province (Wu <em>et al.</em> 1999).

This species is limited to the coasts of lower reaches and estuaries of Yangzi River (Su and Li 2002).","There is no use and trade information available for this species, however many <em>Takifugu </em>species, although not targeted, are incidentally caught. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> spp. are primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing (K.

Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu coronoidus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. coranoidus</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>   <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).</p>","There have been no confirmed population declines in <em>T. plagiocellatus</em>.  However, because of its affinity with coral reefs and seagrass beds, we  infer that it may be experiencing population declines due to habitat  loss in parts of its range.This little known species is likely threatened by coral reef and seagrass habitat losses. As of 2008, fifteen percent of the world’s coral reefs were considered under imminent threat of being “Effectively Lost” (with 90% of the corals lost and unlikely to recover soon), with regions in East Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the wider Caribbean being the most highly threatened (Wilkinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Of 704 zooxanthellate reef-building coral species which were assessed by using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Criteria, 32.8% are in categories with elevated risk of extinction (Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2008). One-third of global seagrass species are currently experiencing population declines, and 21% of globally assessed seagrass species are in threatened or Near Threatened categories primarily due to coastal development and pollution (Short <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).<br/><br/>In addition, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. plagiocellatus</span> may be impacted by the following:<br/><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia.

Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).   <p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. exascurus.</em>&#160;However, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. exascurus</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing&#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>  <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

Historical landings from the Yangtzee River basin show steep declines in landings (95%) from the 1950s to the 1970s, and although recent landing statistics are not available, qualitative assessments by scientists in the region indicate that wild stocks of this species are in a state of decline. It is inferred that this species is dependent on fisheries management, such as off-fishing seasons, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and the increasing aquaculture of fish to meet increasing consumer demand which can not be met by wild stocks alone. Therefore, it is considered Conservation Dependent and is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened.&#160;Further research is needed to better quantify stock decline, and may reveal that this species qualifies for a higher threat category, especially given its high commercial value.

At present, the price of <em>T. flavidus</em> is the highest among puffer species in China (Zhang&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. flavidus</em> are not fully understood, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species has been crossed with the commercially important&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in  order to maximize desirable traits both parent species, creating a  commercially-desirable hybrid suitable for aquaculture (Zhao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<strong>Population Structure<br/></strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. bimaculatus</span> (Yamanoue<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008).

Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).&#160;<p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span> is cultured in China for export to Japan, where its flesh is consumed as food (Ji <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011). Artificial breeding of this high-value species is occurring in order to  continue to meet consumer demands despite declining numbers (Shi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). This species has been crossed with the commercially important <em>T. rubripes</em>  in order to maximize desirable traits both parent species, creating a  commercially-desirable hybrid suitable for aquaculture (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>)). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (&gt;50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. flavidus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. flavidus</em>. Additionally,<em> T. flavidus </em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p>    <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>    <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

During trawls of the shelf and drop-off areas of southwestern  Sakhalin, maximum catches of this species this were recorded at a  temperature of 16–17°C over depths of 115 to 124 metres. In general, the main  aggregation of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. porphyreus</span> was concentrated over the shelf, at depths shallower than 200 meters (Velikanov and Stominok 2006).<br/><br/><em>Takifugu porphyreus</em> bio-accumulates tetrodotoxin (TTX).

They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).","<em></em><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><em><br/>Takifugu porphyreus</em> is commercially targeted for the Fugu  trade. Japanese fisheries data from 1979–2007 show fluctuating landing  trends which appear to indicate shifting targets, and marked declines in  recent years. As fewer highly-desirable and notably over-exploited  species were landed (Torafugu <em>T. rubripes</em> and Karasu <em>T. chinensis</em>), landings of <em>T. porphyreus</em>  began to increase in 1990 and continued to increase until 2003 to a peak  of ~380 tonnes after which landings declined to less than 150 tonnes  between 2005 and 2007. The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. </em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">porphyreus</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p><p>  </p>","<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;inter-specific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Although the recent sharp decrease in landings of <em>T. porphyreus</em> observed from 2003 to 2007<em> </em>is cause for concern, the window of time over which this decline has occurred is insufficient for the application of criterion A.<br/><br/>Several reasons have been given to account for declining populations of targeted Fugu species. Fugu species are&#160;primarily captured by long-line.This fishing method is highly effective and has become widespread with the advent of modified, low-cost, easy-to-use long lines&#160;(Nagai 2003). The targeting of sexually immature individuals between age one and two has resulted in population declines in the commercially-important<em> T. rubripes.</em> It is&#160;inferred&#160;that juvenile <em>T. porphyreus</em> are likely to also be subject to this fishing preference.<br/><br/><em>Takifugu porphyreus</em> appears to be common off southwestern Sakhalin.

In the Yangtze River estuary, this species is known to spawn from May to June, May to July and April to June (Ruijing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).</p>","<p><em>Takifugu pardalis</em>&#160;may be threatened by coastal habitat degradation and overfishing in parts of its range.&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. xanthopterus</em> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.</p>  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu pardalis</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. chrysops</span> (Yamanoue<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008).

It is found at depths ranging from one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifugu pardalis </em>is incidentally caught, but is not targeted by consumptive fisheries. It is called ""Higan-fugu"" in Japan (Nakabo 2002).&#160;<em>Takifugu pardalis</em>, like other Fugu species, is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is very efficient in catching this species (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005).</p>","There is little species-specific population information available for <em>T. stictonotus.

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010). Stock enhancement programs exist for  this species in Japan using  hatchery raised fingerlings (Fushimi 2001).  Optimal release locations  have been determined (Nakajima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>   2008), however it has been found that hatchery-reared juveniles were   more easily preyed upon than wild juveniles due to differences in   swimming depth and TTX concentrations (Shimizu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>        <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005).</p>","There is little species-specific population information for <em>T. snyderi.

Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010).

The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to the importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999.

Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time, the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1991, Miyaki <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Kai <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).

However, there has been expressed interest in utilizing this resource, and in rearing this species in floating fish cages (Yu 2003). Individuals may occasionally appear in markets. This species is marketed as ""Komon-damashi"" in Japan (Nakabo 2002).<br/><p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are as follows: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger  puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases  (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>  Additionally, the toxic viscera of pufferfish (mainly ovaries and liver) produce tetrodotoxin, which is valued for its many pharmaceutical applications (Yu 2003).",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu alboplumeus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. alboplumbeus</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. oblongus</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this minor commercial species are impacted by this fishery. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</span><br/> Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu </span>are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</span><br/> Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). <br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu oblongus </span>is rare in the waters of Hong Kong (Sadovy and Cornish 2000) and Japan, which is the upper limit of its range (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Along the coasts of Pattani and Narathiwat provinces bordering the Gulf of Thailand, samplings were conducted every two months from November 2005 to July 2007 by bottom trawl towing during daylight hours at approximately 2.3 knot for 60 minutes, and only five specimens were collected in a total of 144 hauls (Hajisamae and Yeesin 2010).<br/><br/><em>Takifugu oblongus</em> is common in museum collections, where it was represented by 54 lots (FishNet2 Database searched December 2013).",Decreasing,"In the Indo-West Pacific,<em> T. oblongus</em> is distributed from  South Africa to Indonesia, northward to Japan, southward to Australia. It is found along the coast of the South China Sea, and in the southern part of the east China Sea (Su and Li 2002, Nakabo 2002). It is found at depths of one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifugu oblongus </em>may be a minor component of the Japanese puffer fish trade. It is called ""Taki-fugu"" in Japan. Despite a ban on the sale of toxic pufferfishes in fish markets,&#160;<em>T. oblongus</em> may sometimes found in processed fish products in Taiwan (Huang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/><strong>Aquaculture</strong><br/>There is no evidence that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. oblongus</span> has been artificially cultured. Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. oblongus.</em>&#160;However, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. oblongus</em>. It is unknown whether&#160;<em>T. oblongus </em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p>     <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>      <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>      <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is known to inhabit a variety of shallow-water marine and brackish habitats to depths of 10 m, including estuaries, bays, tidal creeks, protected coastal waters, seagrass beds and mangrove swamps. <em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> is common and abundant in parts of its range and may be an important component of the trophic structure in mangrove systems. This species is considered highly toxic and is not targeted by consumption fisheries. There are no major threats, and the only real utilization for this species is for its toxic properties, as a poison to pest mammalians. There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>S. testudineus,</em>&#160;however, its range overlaps several marine protected areas. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.","<strong>Habitat/Ecology</strong><br/><em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> is found predominantly in bays, tidal creeks, protected coastal waters, seagrass beds, mangrove swamps, and estuaries and is confined to very shallow depths over sandy and muddy bottoms (Robins and Ray 1986). It utilizes mangrove roots for protection (MacDonald <em>et al.</em> 2009). It is considered an estuarine-resident in Brazil and is important in the trophic equilibrium of the Paranaguá estuarine complex, where it is common and abundant (Fávaro <em>et al. </em>2009). These habitats include both marine and brackish waters. <em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> is absent or rare on coral reefs. It is more numerically abundant in low-energy estuaries with relatively less marine influence, which are characterized by lower pH, low dissolved oxygen, well-developed mangroves, and low water transparency (<span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5"">Fávaro<em> et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>While this species does not form schools, it is known to form large aggregations. When frightened, this species is known to dive into sandy substrate to take refuge (Lieske and Myers 1994). Juveniles prey mainly on gastropods, bivalves and brachyuran crabs—while adults consume the same prey items as juveniles, the diet gradually shifts to a bivalve and crab-dominant diet, supplemented by amphipods, hermit crabs, seagrasses, detritus, isopods, barnacles, tunicates and sipunculids. Partitioning of food resources enables <em>S. spengleri </em>to coexist with <em>S. testudineus</em> (Targett 1978). <em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> is considered a very successful competitor, and may restrict the ranges of several other members of the genus by competitive exclusion (Targett 1978). As a dominant component of the coastal Yucatan fish fauna, it plays an important role in transferring energy from the benthos to higher trophic levels of the food chain (Chi-Espínola and Vega-Cendejas 2013).<br/><br/>In a study in a Caribbean mangrove habitat, in Honduras, MacDonald <em>et al.</em> (2009) found that checkered puffers spent about 60% of their time resting in place, often protected within the maze of mangrove roots, following brief intervals spent swimming or feeding.<br/><br/><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5"">The results contribute to the biological knowledge of the species and highlight the importance and trophic function of <em>S. testudineus</em> for the energy transfer from the benthos to higher trophic levels of the food chain.<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/><strong>Reproduction</strong><br/><em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> typically maintains a 1:1 sex ratio.

Reflecting results in Colborn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2001), the geographic range of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. glossodonta</span> is likely representative of multiple species. Data on population decline are available from only a few locations, despite the expansive geographic range. In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and   modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6%   of the total catch; in 1992, they comprised only 7.5% of the total catch. This decline (37.1% in 15 years) was a result of overfishing, as opposed to a change in fishing method and effort (Beets 2000). Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). In Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, recent studies have demonstrated significant declines in abundance and average size of bonefish in the catch between 1977 and the late 1990s. Given fisheries characteristics throughout the region, we expect that in areas where bonefish are exposed to fishing effort that Tarawa serves as an example of what would likely occur in other areas throughout its range.&#160; In addition, although data on population decline is limited, this species may be closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Valiela <em>et al.</em>(2001) estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year.&#160; Using this estimate, mangroves have declined  global by an estimated 27% over the last three generation lengths for <em>A. glossodonta </em>(13.5  years).&#160; Much of this species' distribution lies in the Indo-Pacific,  where up to 14% of mangrove species are listed as threatened  (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) in some places  (Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160; The Indo-Malay Philippine Archipelago  is of particular concern, as it has one of the highest rates of mangrove  loss globally, with an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since  1980 (FAO 2007).&#160; In the tropical Indo-Pacific, 12% of all seagrasses  are currently threatened, and 20% of all seagrass species are  experiencing declines.&#160; In the temperate North Pacific, the  northern-most part of <em>A. glossodonta</em>'s range, 22% of all seagrass  species are threatened, and 44% are experiencing population declines  (Short <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Given the&#160; declines in these habitats,   we infer that the extreme habitat loss in parts of its   Pacific  range  will have similar negative consequences for population    trajectories. In addition, the recreational fishery is not well-established in the Indo-Pacific region, so there is little economic incentive for conservation; we do not expect conservation to be occurring at present. Therefore, we estimate global decline to equal or exceed 30% over three generation lengths in the past (13.5 years), with some substantially greater localized depletions in parts of the Indo-Pacific. Perhaps the greatest hindrances to the global conservation of this species are uncertainties about population connectivity and taxonomic resolution.

Crustaceans comprised more than 50% of the diet in a Hawaiian study (Friedlander 1997).<br/><br/>Natural mortality from sharks is very high at Palmyra Atoll (Adams pers. comm. 2011). The maximum size for this species is 90 cm (SL) (Myers 1991).","Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have decreased dramatically  over the past few decades, presumably because of overfishing and loss of  habitat, from over 300,000lbs in 1900 to less than 3,000lbs.  since 2002. Bonefish were the most important species in the commercial seine  fishery between 1966 and 1970, with average annual yields of nearly  18,000 pounds. Although the presence of multiple species within the  fishery makes species-specific declines hard to pinpoint, the commercial  seine catch now averages only 581lbs per year, accounting for less  than 8% of the catch. Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have declined from over  136.4 mt in 1900 to only 1.2 mt in 2001. This figure, however, includes  all   bonefish species in Hawaii (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>Heavy fishing pressure and degradation of habitats at Tarawa and Kiritimati Atolls  have resulted in the loss of pre-spawning staging sites and spawning  migration routes, which may be responsible for the observed declines in  bonefish catches, average size, and sex ratios at these locations (Friedlander<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008). There are declines in CPUE, mean length and weight of fish and also a change in sex ratio (Beets 2000). Sex ratio (F:M) was 0.71:1 in 1977 and in 1992–1993 it was recorded as 0.15:1. In 1977, mean length was 46.4 cm and mean weight was 1.3 kg. In 1992, mean length recorded was 37.6 cm and mean weight was 0.84 kg. There was a decrease in the smallest size of sexually mature individuals between the two time periods: in 1977 the smallest size of sexually mature males was 42.5 cm&#160; and 46.5 cm for females; in 1992 is was 32 cm for males and 35 cm for females. In addition, Beets (2000) conservatively estimates that the 30% of total catch was non-reproductive. In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6% of the total catch; in 1992, they comprised only 7.5% of the total catch. Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). The effects of catch-and-release fishing on this species are unclear.<br/><br/>Unrestrained growth of human populations in the coastal zones has also  accelerated habitat destruction, water quality degradation, and  disruption of prey species dynamics. Fishing and habitat loss and degradation may pose the most significant threats to this species. Disruptions to shallow  coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses and mangroves due to climate  change may pose significant future threats to this species, particularly  in areas with accelerated rates of coastal development and  urbanization. <br/><br/>The limited range of this species may  also make it vulnerable to local threats, such as habitat loss  (Friedlander<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008). It has been noted that habitat alteration, fragmentation and loss may contribute to the  decline in abundance of this species in Tarawa (Beets 2000). Bonefish are closely associated with mangroves,seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Given the dramatic  declines in these habitats (Mumby <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004, Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2001, Polidoro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Orth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006, Short <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011), we infer that comparable regional declines are likely  throughout its range. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2001) estimates that mangroves have  decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year. Since bonefish rely upon habitats of  limited extent, they are especially susceptible to habitat loss and  degradation, particularly due to climatic and anthropogenic influences. These habitats are often fragmented in nature, exacerbating this  issue. As with other coastal species, fragmentation will likely have  direct and indirect negative impacts on bonefish.","As multiple species within the genus are morphologically  indistinguishable, there is limited species-specific information  available on population status. Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have declined from over 136.4  mt in 1900 to only 1.2 mt in 2001. This figure, however, includes all  bonefish species in Hawaii (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). A recreational fishing guide on Oahu indicated that although netting of  bonefish continues, it is not as prevalent as it once was (Adams pers.  comm. 2011). It is therefore unclear whether the decline in landings is due to a change in effort or a true change in population size. Capture of recruits (CPUE) of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula </span>spp. in Kahana, Hawaii was highest in 1999 and has declined by 79% since that time (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>This species is rare in Mauritius (Sato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<br/><br/>In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and  modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6%  of the total catch; in 1992, they were 7.5% of the total catch. This decline (37.1% in 15 years) was a result of overfishing, as opposed to a change in fishing method and effort (Beets 2000). Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). A survey from the Fisheries Division of Kiribati conducted in 1995 shows  that bonefish was the second-most common species caught, accounting for 7% of  total catch. Gill nets caught 82% of the bonefish, with handlines  providing the remainder (18%) of the catch (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). In Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, recent studies have demonstrated significant  declines in abundance and average size of bonefish in the catch between  1977 and the late 1990s. The annual take of bonefish from Tarawa Lagoon  is between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 fish per year, but no stock  assessment has been conducted (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). This species is probably the most abundant molluscivorous fish in the lagoon (Beets 2001). Comparison data from fished and protected locations at Palmyra Atoll   show significant differences in population characteristics which may   indicate that threats are expressed asymmetrically across its range   (Adams pers. comm. 2011).&#160; Given fisheries characteristics throughout the region, we expect that in  areas where bonefish are exposed to fishing effort that Tarawa serves  as an example of what would likely occur in other areas throughout its  range. In addition, the recreational fishery is not  well-established in the Indo-Pacific, so there is little economic incentive for  conservation.&#160; Therefore, we do  not expect conservation to be occurring at  present.<br/><br/>Like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span>, <em>A. glossodonta</em>&#160; may be  closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other   shallow  coastal habitats. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et  al.</span> (2001)  estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a  rate of  2% per year. &#160; Using this estimate, mangroves have declined global by an estimated 27% over the last three generation lengths for <em>A. glossodonta </em>(13.5 years).&#160; Much of this species' distribution lies in the Indo-Pacific, where up to 14% of mangrove species are listed as threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) in some places (Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160; The Indo-Malay Philippine Archipelago is of particular concern, as it has one of the highest rates of mangrove loss globally, with an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007).&#160; In the tropical Indo-Pacific, 12% of all seagrasses are currently threatened, and 20% of all seagrass species are experiencing declines.&#160; In the temperate North Pacific, the northern-most part of A. glossodonta's range, 22% of all seagrass species are threatened, and 44% are experiencing population declines (Short <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Given the&#160; declines in these habitats,  we infer that the extreme habitat loss in parts of its   Pacific  range will have similar negative consequences for population    trajectories. <br/><br/>Given population declines of at least 30%&#160; over three generation lengths at Tarawa, significant habitat loss throughout much of its range, we estimate global decline to equal or exceed 30% over three generation lengths (13.5 years),  with some substantially greater localized depletions in parts of the Indo-Pacific.",Decreasing,"<p>The Shortjaw Bonefish occurs from Hawaii and French Polynesia to the Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean, north to southern Japan and south to Lord Howe Island, Australia.

This species has been reported to form spawning aggregations and reaches a maximum longevity of at least 40 years, with the age of 50% maturity being reached at 8 to 10 years of age. This species is long-lived with low natural mortality and is vulnerable to overfishing.&#160;It is highly prized in most of its range and is fished in commercial, recreational and artisanal fisheries. It is also farmed in floating net cages in Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines and is found in the live reef fish food trade. This species is experiencing localized population declines in parts of its range. It is subject to varying degrees of management throughout its range and is found in marine protected areas. Despite localized declines, this is a widespread species and we suspect that it occurs in many areas of low fishing pressure, where it is still abundant. Therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern; however, monitoring of this species where it is heavily exploited is recommended.","This reef-associated species occurs in the vicinity of coral or rocky reefs (Anderson 1986), often over adjacent sand flats and gravel patches (Allen 1985). It is also trawled in deeper water on relatively flat or hard bottoms bottoms. Juveniles less than 20 cm long are common in mangrove areas (Allen 1985) in near shore, turbid waters, or among both coastal and deeper water offshore reefs (Williams and Russ 1992). They move to deeper waters as they grow larger (McPherson <em>et al.</em> 1988), with large fish often moving into shallower water during the winter months (Williams and Russ 1992, McPherson <em>et al.</em> 1988). They form schools of similar-sized individuals or are solitary (Kailola <em>et al.</em> 1993) and are frequently commensal with sea urchins (Allen 1985).&#160;This species feeds on fishes, crabs, stomatopods, other benthic crustaceans and cephalopods (Anderson and Allen 2001). <em>Lutjanus sebae</em> is a commercially important species in many parts of its range, but in certain regions of the Indian Ocean, large individuals are known to cause ciguatera poisoning (Opic&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1994).&#160;<em>Lutjanus sebae</em>&#160;reaches a maximum fork length of about 116 cm (McPherson and Squire 1990).&#160;<br/><br/>Emperor red snappers are broadcast spawners (Grimes 1987) and form spawning aggregations (Robinson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;&#160;Males are significantly larger than females on both the east coast of Australia (McPherson <em>et al.</em> 1985) and west coast of Australia (Newman and Dunk 2002).&#160;A maximum age estimate of 34 years attained in the Kimberly region of western Australia may be an underestimate of longevity given the population had already been fished for two decades, and in 2010 a 40 years old, but not very large (51.6 cm FL), female specimen was captured off the Kimberley coast of north-western Australia (Newman <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species lives to at least 40 years old and as such has low rates of natural mortality (Newman<em> et al</em>. 2010), which has been measured at 0.104 to 0.122 (Newman and Dunk 2002). Age at 50% maturity is 8 to 10 years at 43 cm FL for females, 8 years at 46 cm FL for males (Flood <em>et al</em>. 2014). Most individuals have reached full maturity at 62 cm (Grandcourt <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>At New Caledonia and Australia, spawning occurs mainly during spring and summer. The duration of the spawning period is approximately 7 months. (McPherson&#160;<em>et al.</em>1992).","This commercially important species is caught using handlines, traps and trawls (Anderson and Allen 2001). It is caught primarily by handline for recreational and commercial purposes in Australia (Sumpton and Brown 2010). This species is utilized in commercial aquaculture enterprises in Southeast Asia (Imanto <em>et al.</em> 2006). In the commercial aquarium industry, small juvenile&#160;<em>L. sebae</em>&#160;are very popular and in high demand&#160;and are exported from the Philippines and Indonesia for the aquarium trade&#160;(Bray 2011). It is characterized by slow growth, long life span and large size and age at maturity indicating a low production potential and vulnerability to over-exploitation (Newman and Dunk 2002, Grandcourt <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Studies in the Seychelles found the mean age and size at which <em>L. sebae</em> was vulnerable to to handlines was considerably lower than the age and size at which sexual maturity is reached (Grandcourt <em>et al.</em> 2008). This species has low natural mortality rates in the order of &lt;0.10 year <sup>-1 </sup>indicating that the production potential of this species is low and that they are highly vulnerable to over-exploitation.","A retrospective stock assessment of this species at the Seychelles Bank between 1977 and 2006 found that demographic parameters predispose this species to overfishing. <em>Lutjanus sebae</em> becomes vulnerable to fishing gear at a mean size and age before the attainment of sexual maturity at 62 cm, and the fishery is highlighted as one needing urgent attention. &#160;Production potential of this species has likely been overestimated in the past which highlights the importance of incorporating age-based demographic parameters in stock assessments for relatively long-lived, slow growing tropical species.&#160;Up to 65.7% of yields in the fishery in 2004 were individuals under the mean size at which sexual maturity is achieved&#160;(Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><strong><br/></strong>Analysis of otolith stable isotopes indicates that the Emperor red snapper comprises a number of separate biological stocks in the North Coast Bioregion/Western Australia, which is the primary area of exploitation for this species -&#160;one in Kimberley, one in the Pilbara and the third in Gascoyne. Stock status was considered sustainable in &#160;this area. The stock status is Undefined in the Northern Territory and Queensland (Flood <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In the Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery (NDSF) within the Kimberly region of Western Australia,<em> L. sebae</em> has comprised on average 23.6% of the total landed catch of demersal scalefish from 1995 through 1999, ca. 160 metric tonnes per year (Newman and Dunk 2002). Although longevity of this species is at least 40 years of age (Newman <em>et al.</em> 2010), individual <em>L. sebae</em> in excess of 20 years of age comprised &lt; 10% of the 439 fish aged in 2006 from the NDSF in the Kimberly region (Newman <em>et al</em>. 2010). Catch levels of this species in the NDSF over the last 5 years (2009 to 2013) have been stable, ranging between 128 and 156 t, and were below catch levels for the preceding 5-year period of sustainable fishing (Flood <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Long-term standardized catch rates of this species to 2009 showed declines in the Gulf of Carpentaria (O'Neill <em>et al</em>. 2011).

There is some loss of mangrove habitat, which may represent a refuge for this species in areas where other forest has been lost, for aquaculture (e.g. in northern Sumbawa), roads and urban development; mangrove distribution in this region is however fragmented and patchy, although it is not clear whether this is natural or a consequence of habitat loss.","Judging from the paucity of specimens in museum collections, the species is rare. Several expeditions failed to collect this species and the Western Australian Museum held several consecutive expeditions that between them only collected about a half dozen specimens (Kitchener, How and Smith, pers. comm. 2010, de Lang, 2011). In seven months surveying in the Lesser Sundas between 2010 and 2013 only two specimens (one each on Sumbawa and Flores) were found across the entire island group. This may have been a sampling artefact as these surveys did not target apparently suitable mangrove habitat (S. Reilly pers. comm. 2019). As a widespread species it seems unlikely to be naturally truly rare (D.T. Iskandar pers. comm. 2019), but it occurs in mangrove habitat that is difficult to survey (S. Reilly pers. comm. 2019).",Unknown,"This species has been recorded from Lombok, Sumbawa, Rinca, Komodo, Flores, Sumba, and Alor Islands, within the Lesser Sunda Islands (Indonesia).

In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012).

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu niphobles</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. alboplumbeus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>     <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu poecilonotus</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. exascurus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). <br/><em><br/>Takifugu poecilonotus</em> is common and can be locally abundant in Japan, where it is seen in small schools of less than 20 individuals (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). During bi-monthly underwater visual censuses in the sub-tidal habitat of  Nagahama, Wakasa Bay, Sea of Japan, over five years from January 2002 to  December 2006, this species was observed during 153 of 360 transect  surveys and was the most frequently  observed tetraodontid. Sighting frequency was independent of water  temperature. This species was also observed during similar underwater  visual surveys conducted from 1970 to 1972, although the exact number could  not be found because the survey could not be accessed (Masuda 2007). Fifteen specimens of this species were collected in the surfzone of a sandy beach in Southern Japan, where it was more abundant than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. reticularis (</span>six specimens collected) but far less abundant than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. niphobles</span> (118 specimens collected) (Inoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>Takifugu poecilonotus</em> is moderately in museum collections. It was represented by 41 lots (FishNet2 database searched March 2014).",Unknown,"In the Northwest Pacific, <em>T. poecilonotus</em> is known from the southern Korean Peninsula throughout Japan, including the Pacific coast (Ikeda <em>et al.</em> 2010), south to Taiwan (Shao 1997) and Hong Kong (Ni and Kwok 1999). In Japan, this species is distributed from 23°–45° N (Masuda 2007). It is found at depths ranging from one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifufu poecilonotus</em> is incidentally harvested for food but is not targeted (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Although it is sometimes marketed as ""Komon-fugu"" in Japan (Noguchi and Arakawa 2008), this species displays a frequent occurrence of considerably high levels  of TTX in its muscle tissue, and its preparation and consumption has  been been cited as a public concern (Kodama <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1984). Despite a ban on the sale of toxic pufferfishes in fish markets,&#160;<em>T. poecilonotus</em> may sometimes found in processed fish products in Taiwan (Huang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<em> Takifugu poecilonotus</em>, like other fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).   <p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>There is no evidence that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. poecilonotus </span>is artificially cultured. Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>  </p><p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu poecilonotus,</em>&#160;however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. poecilonutus</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>   <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>   <p><strong>Further Research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth&#160;among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. puffer </em>&#160;is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999 (Kikuchi 2006). One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high mortality (survival is estimated to be less than 50%) from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).</p><p>Tiger puffer (<em>T. rubripes</em>) was introduced to China from Japan (Lin and &#160;Huang 2007). To meet increasing demand for pufferfish, China began large-scale artificial breeding of pufferfish in the 1990s. An annual output of about 4000 tonnes of <em>T. rubripes</em>, which was introduced from Japan to China (Lin and Huang 2007) is exported to Japan and South Korea. Additionally, an annual output of about 6000 tonnes of <em>T. obscurus</em> was also produced for export in China.

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 5 m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and summer closed-fishing area, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><strong>Extinction Risk Assessment</strong><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/>Takifugu xanthopterus</span> was previously assessed in 1996 by IUCN and was found to be Data Deficient (Roberts 1996)</p>  <p><strong>Further Research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

At an estimated generation time of 25 years (by analogy with <em>B. affinis</em>), total population decline has exceeded 90% over the past three generations (here estimated as three times the time of maturity) as a result of exploitation of eggs and adults as well as habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation and the decline is projected to continue into the future, hence the species also qualifies for listing as CR under criteria A2acd+4cd.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<em>Batagur baska</em> is a highly aquatic turtle species, associated with estuarine river sections, with nesting taking place on large on sand banks. It feeds primarily on riverside plants and fruits, however, it also consumes molluscs and has been observed to accept a variety of animal matter in captivity (Moll 1980). Females mature at 45 cm carapace length and may reach 60 cm; males mature at around 40 cm carapace length and can reach up to 49 cm (Moll 1985). Breeding maturity may occur at an age of nine years in captivity, but requires up to 25 years in rivers with modest productivity (Moll 1980). Females only produce a single clutch per year of about 18-33 eggs (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).","<p><em>Batagur baska</em> has been exploited long-term for local subsistence and ritualistic consumption as well as some regional trade, including supply to the Calcutta markets in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Harvest of its eggs has been extensive as the eggs are highly prized for consumption and can be collected at known sites at predictable times.<br/><br/>The species’ use of estuarine and mangrove habitats and sandy nesting beaches means it has been significantly impacted by habitat loss, as estuaries are prime locations for human settlement and industrial development, mangrove areas are cleared for fuelwood and for shrimp and other aquaculture development, and sandy banks and beaches are exploited for sand as building material and tourist developments.<br/><br/>The extent of threat posed by entanglement in fishing nets, the effects of altered water flow from hydrological mega-projects (dams, reservoirs, river diversion) on nesting sites and habitat in general, or habitat pollution, have not been documented as specific threats, but have likely impacted the species.<br/><br/>Seizure records from illegal trade have reported both <em>B. affinis </em>and<em> B. baska </em>as<em> ‘Batagur baska</em>’; at least 139 live specimens of one of these two species were reported as seized from 6 illegal trade shipments during the period 2000-2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73).&#160;</p>","<p>In the 1980s a moderate to large breeding population of <em>Batagur baska</em> was thought to exist in the Sunderbans of Bangladesh (Moll 1985).

The total Indian population was estimated as fewer than 40 animals, with about three nests produced per year, although there was hope that more animals and/or nesting sites might exist and be found with intensive survey efforts (Lucknow Red List Workshop participants, 2005). Participants at the 2011 Singapore Red List Workshop estimated that about 30 adult animals remained.&#160;In India, there are 8 males and 7 females; and 300 juveniles in captivity (S.

Currently, only three females remain in two pagoda ponds (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In Austria, there are two males, three females and 15 juveniles held in an assurance colony (P.

The species inhabits shallow inshore tropical and subtropical waters around coral reefs and mangrove fringes on continental and insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 92 m. It is taken mainly in artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries, which are intense and largely unmanaged throughout its range.<br/><br/>This species was formerly common in the Gulf of California in the 1960s but has since become rare there and extensive surveys of multiple landings sites in 1998–1999 did not encounter this species. Similar patterns of decline occurred in Brazil where it is considered extinct in the state of São Paulo and there have been no recent records in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Espírito Santo. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, this species now appears to be rare, yet it was formerly abundant in Banc D’Arguin, Mauritania, and it has been depleted by the 1990s and not seen there since 2009. This species now only seems common in the Cape Verde and is rare elsewhere in West Africa. Artisanal and commercial target and bycatch fishing pressure is intense and management is lacking throughout much of its range. It is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) in approximately three-quarters of its range in the Southwest and Eastern Central Atlantic and the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, however, this species is likely to be stable in the Western Central and Northwest Atlantic part of its range which likely has significant fraction of suitable habitat and lower fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (50 years)&#160;based on abundance indices, regional decline in area of occupancy, and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.</span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>The Lemon Shark is demersal and pelagic in shallow inshore tropical and subtropical waters around coral reefs and mangrove fringes to a depth of 92 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It reaches a maximum size of at least 340 cm total length (TL) and possibly as much as 368 cm TL (Hueter and Gruber 1982). Males mature at 224 cm TL and females mature at 239 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is placentotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 4–17 pups, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 60–65 cm TL. Female age-at-maturity is 12.7 years and maximum age is at least 20.2 years (Brown and Gruber 1988), and possibly higher with one individual estimated to be 37 years old based on mark-recapture and genetics (Brooks&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Generation length is therefore at least 16.5 years. The Lemon Shark has low-to-moderate productivity of 0.158 year<sup>-1</sup> (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>","<p>The Lemon shark is taken as target and bycatch of artisanal and commercial longline and gillnet fisheries, which are intense and unmanaged across much of its range. It is taken recreationally on hook and line in the United States of America (USA). This shark has a medium-to-high susceptibility to fishing (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016, Saldaña-Ruiz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017) and its large size and slow life history suggest it is sensitive to fishing pressure. Historically, the Lemon Shark has been a target species in Belize, Mexico, and USA and reported as bycatch in St. Lucia (Oliver 1996, Anon. 1997). In the USA in 2018, estimated commercial landings were 8,910 individuals yielding 37,593 lbs dressed weight and it was commonly caught by recreational anglers (NMFS 2019).</p><p>Fisheries effort increased considerably in the Gulf of California in the 1980s and 1990s, with an increase in the number of fishers, vessels, and nets in the water; depletion of large pelagic sharks and other species occurred and caused fishers to turn to coastal species (Sala&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Off Mazatlan, Mexico, unmanaged gillnet and longline fisheries targeting sharks arose prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965). Artisanal drift gillnets and demersal longlines are common further south in Mexico and there is a single record of this shark at ""Tres Marias"" Islands and Isabel Island in the Central Mexican Pacific (Pérez-Jiménez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Across much of its Central and South American range, artisanal fisheries are ongoing and are inadequately managed.</p><p>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) decreased by 71% from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased.</p><p>In Mauritania, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates increased by 246% over 1992–2015 (23 years). Historically, catches gradually rose from 1,918 t in 1950 to 9,916 t in 1979 then declined to 6,302 t in 1991, then rose steeply to a peak of 17,015 t in 2015 (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). These increases in landings are congruent with the fishing effort that has increased substantially during the same period (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). While effort has been stable, catches have continued to increase. In Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed at least a 30% decline, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981, then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Guinea-Bissau, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates data have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 22% decline over the years 2012–2016. Historically, catches gradually rose 6-fold from 782 t in 1962 to 5,001 t in 1997 then steeply rose to a peak of 17,181 t in 2012 followed by a fluctuating decline to 13,485 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region.</p><p>Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for Lemon Shark, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many parts of its range (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) and may have consequences for population viability.</p>","<p>The only estimate of abundance available for the Lemon Shark is from Bimini, The Bahamas where it is estimated that, on average, approximately 77 juvenile individuals inhabit the inshore areas of the North Sound at census time (White <em>et al. </em>2014) while there are around 400 juveniles in the South Bimini nursery (R.D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2020). In the western Atlantic, Lemon Shark genetic structure has been proposed as both showing relatively little structure with no discontinuities between the Caribbean Sea and Brazil indicating that gene flow occurs throughout the western Atlantic (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2014), and suggesting there are two distinct northern and southern hemisphere stocks (Ashe <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>First, in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, population trend data is available from a stock assessment from the southeast United States (US), Gulf of Mexico, and the Bahamas (Hansell <em>et al.</em> 2020). The time-series of relative abundance (biomass as a fraction of that which would achieve maximum sustainable yield, B/BMSY) was analysed using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020, Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). The trend analysis of the time-series for 1981–2017 revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.4%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 16.9% over three generation lengths (50 years), with the highest probability of an increasing population over three generation lengths.</p><p>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia this species is rare enough that the only recent records are anecdotal (P. Mejía-Falla unpubl. data 2020). In Brazil, this species has been exploited to the point where it has disappeared from&#160;parts of southeast and&#160;central Brazil after being formerly abundant. Similar levels of fishing pressure are likely to have occurred throughout southern central America and Venezuela and the Guianas. In Brazil, it is considered extinct in the state of São Paulo and it is serious depleted and there have been no recent records in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Espírito Santo (ICMBio 2018). Declines in juvenile abundance were documented in their nursery grounds at Atol das Rocas, a Marine Protected Area in Brazil, over a very short period (1999–2003) and hence it is hard to draw any wider population inference. These declines were used to suggest that even a modest level of fishing and removal of mature females in adjacent areas may dramatically affect small&#160;populations of sharks within a small and isolated protected area (Freitas <em>et al.</em> 2009). This species is considered to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;30% over three generation lengths (50 years) due to fishing pressure causing a decline in area of occupancy.<br/></p><p>Third, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific this species was formerly common but because it was prized for its meat, fins, skin, and liver oil it has been intensively exploited to the point where it is now rarely landed and reported throughout its range. There are few data but insight into the pattern of decline can be derived from the long history of landings from Mexico. There, in the Gulf of California, the Lemon Shark was formerly common in the 1960s, but in recent decades has become rare in the artisanal fishery (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species was historically a prized catch (since the 1940s). Landings of this species peaked at 200 t in 1969 and declined to close to zero by the mid-1990s (<span lang=""EN-US"">Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). In comparison to other species, its relative abundance was scored as ‘high’ in the 1960s, ‘moderate' between the 1970s and 1980s and 'low' in the 1990s and 2000s (<span lang=""EN-US"">Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). It was not recorded in surveys of 28 artisanal landings sites in Sinaloa from 1998–1999 that enumerated a total of 2,390 sharks (Bizarro <em>et al. </em>2009, J.J. Bizarro unpubl. data. 2020). Elasmobranchs are the target fishery across much of this state (Bizarro <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160;Other species that have undergone a similar pattern of decline in Gulf of California, Mexico are similarly rare throughout the region. For example, the Whitenose Shark (<em>Nasolamia velox</em>) underwent a similar pattern of decline in Mexico and is suspected to have declined to the point where it was assessed as Endangered throughout its distribution in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific (R. Pollom pers. comm. 25 August 2020). On the Pacific Ocean side of Costa Rica, this species may have been taken in small numbers in the demersal longline fishery 10–15 years ago but now that effort has been reduced as the fishery transitioned to an offshore pelagic longline fishery. Gill nets have also been reduced in the North Pacific in recent years (M. Espinoza unpubl. data 2020).</span></p><p>In Colombia, there are few historic records of this species, and it can be considered scarce there, found only at Gorgona Island on the Pacific coast (P. Mejía-Falla unpubl. data 2020). This species may now be very uncommon in Ecuador (<a>A. Cevallos unpubl. data 2020</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">). In the area around Caleta Constante in northern Peru, there is an artisanal fishery targeting elasmobranchs (Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005). While the main catch included Smoothhounds (<em>Mustelus </em>spp.), Angel Shark (<em>Squatina armata</em>), Pacific Guitarfish (<em>Pseudobatos</em> <em>planiceps</em>), and stingrays (<em>Myliobatis</em> spp. and <em>Urotrygon </em>spp.), other species caught included Lemon Shark, Bull shark (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>), Tiger Shark (<em>G. cuvier</em>), and other <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. Catches of elasmobranchs in the artisanal fishery in the years leading up to 1995 had declined significantly (Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005). Artisanal and some commercial target and bycatch fishing pressure is intense over much of its range and lacks management. Overall, given the intense fishing pressure through most of its Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific range and its relative rarity in recent decades in some areas, it is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths in the region (50 years).</p><p>Fourth, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, this species now appears to be rare throughout its range, yet there is good narrative evidence that it was formerly abundant in Banc D’Arguin, Mauritania and declined by the 1990s. This species now only seems common in the Cape Verde Islands where there are sufficient numbers that there are tourism tours of nursery areas (S.D. Pires unpubl. data 2020). Understanding the status of this species is challenging as it is often distributed close to mangroves and may be less catchable by artisanal longlines and gillnets set in deeper waters or in research surveys (G. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).<span lang=""EN-US""> The best understanding of decline of sharks and rays comes from the history of the Banc d’ Arguin in Mauritania (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 25 August 2020). There, sharks were historically abundant, and were not exploited prior to the 1970s and 1980s. Until then coastal artisanal fishers only used surface and demersal nets, and there were no motorized canoes. Development and subsidies drove people towards fisheries including fisheries for sharks using larger mesh gillnets. This combined with the incentive to retain fins from fin buyers led to the rapid depletion of sawfishes (<em>Pristis</em> spp.) and giant guitarfishes and wedgefishes (<em>Glaucostegus</em>, <em>Rhynchobatos</em> and <em>Rhynchorhina </em>spp.), with the last sawfish seen in early 1990s. By late 1990s, hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna&#160;</em>spp.), Oceanic Whitetip (<em>Carcharhinus longimanus</em>), Silky Shark (<em>C. falciformis</em>), Dusky shark (<em>C. obscurus</em>) and other carcharhinids were targeted. In a period of 10-11 years these species became rare including Lemon Shark and Nurse Shark (<em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em>) (M. Ducrocq </span><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 25 August 2020). Lemon Shark has not been recorded in the Banc d’ Arguin National Park since 2009 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, this species is now very rare in Senegal with no captures near Dakar, and only one documented capture from Casamance region on the border between Senegal and Guinea-Bissau (A. Ba unpubl. data 2020). Lemon shark is rarely encountered in Guinea-Bissau, it was not captured in research surveys but may be captured by recreational fishers closer inshore near the mangroves (G. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). There were only three records of this species from surveys of artisanal gillnet fishers in Ghana (I. Seidu pers. comm. 26 August 2020). There are no recent records from Nigeria, but it is possible that Lemon Shark is present in commercial landings, but the catch composition information is aggregated and cannot be identified to species level. There were no recent records from a landing site survey in Cameroon (A. Tamo pers. comm. 26 August 2020), yet there are historic records of this species from a fish market in Cameroon in 1991 but it none since then (C. Grist pers. comm. in Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2005). Lemon shark is captured commonly by artisanal fishers and there are a few records of capture in industrial fisheries (K. Metcalfe and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). There are few records from research surveys of landing sites but it may be captured in commercial fisheries (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). There are more records from adjacent to mangrove forest of the Parc National Conkouati Douli, Republic of Congo (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). There are few records of this species from occasional landings site surveys in Angola (A-L. Soares pers comm. 24 August 2020).&#160;Given the intense fishing pressure through most of its range in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, it is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years).</span></p><p>Artisanal and some commercial target and bycatch fishing pressure is intense over much of its range and lacks management. Overall, given the intense fishing pressure through most of its range, the species' apparent limited biological productivity, and its relative rarity in recent decades in some areas, it is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) in approximately three-quarters of its range in the Southwest and Eastern Central Atlantic and the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, however, this species is likely to be stable in the Western Central and Northwest Atlantic part of its range where there is a significant fraction of habitat. Overall, it is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (50 years)&#160;based on abundance indices and actual levels of exploitation.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Lemon Shark is found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Oceans. In the western Atlantic, it ranges from Virginia (United States of America) to southern Brazil including the Caribbean Sea and in the eastern Atlantic, it ranges from Mauritania to Angola, including Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe (S.D. Pires and G. Porriños unpubl. data 2020). In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, it occurs from northern Mexico to Ecuador (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).</p>","Lemon shark are utilized primarily for meat and fins and comprise 0.46% of the fin trade, based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong in 2014–2015 (Cardeñosa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The rough and heavy skin has made the lemon shark one of the preferred species among tanneries for the production of leather. In parts of its range it is also valued for its liver oil. The Lemon Shark is routinely viewed by recreational snorkellers and SCUBA divers, and is a popular aquarium species.",Marine,"In July 2006, the United States (US) National Marine Fisheries Service finalized the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Federal Management Plan. This Federal Management Plan includes a range of management measures including quotas and seasonal closures. New&#160;habitat areas of particular concern (HAPCs) are being developed for Lemon Shark to reflect recommendations in the 2015 five-year review of the Highly Migratory Species Essential Fish Habitat in the USA.&#160;Lemon sharks are prohibited from being harvested in state waters of Florida, where most of the US habitat occurs.<br/><br/>Misidentification of this species is widespread and likely to  hinder monitoring and conservation efforts (R. D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2020). In the Bahamas, longline fishing was banned in 1993, and peak elasmobranch export occurred the same year. The export steadily declined until the last export of any elasmobranch product from The Bahamas occurred in 2004. The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary was established in 2011 (Haas<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017), and it is currently illegal to fish for, land or possess any sharks or shark parts there. Enforcement is very underfunded and inadequate, making it possible that exploitation may be occurring at present or in the future (R.D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2020). Cuba has designated 21% of the country as a Marine Protected Area. There is no fishing for sharks or rays in these areas. The most important Marine Protected Area is Jardines de la Reina, Alejandro de Humbolt, Guanacabibes. Shark fishing is illegal in Jardines de la Reina Marine Reserve and local guides have noted an increase in sightings of many species of reef-associated sharks including this species since 1997 when the reserve was declared and enforcement of fishing regulations began. Cuba also has two places designated for diving with sharks, Santa Lucia and Jardines de la Reina. Cuba has a prohibition on finning and in 2015 adopted a National Plan of Action for Sharks (NPOA-Sharks).&#160;<br/><br/>In Mexico, there is a closed season for the shark fishery in May and June in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Quintana Roo, and May 15–June 15, and August 1–29 in the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Yucatán. The Official Standard NOM-029-PESC-2007 establishes management measures that prohibit finning. It also establishes that fishing is prohibited at the surrounding area of 5 km of coral reef areas, at adjacent areas in front of mouth rivers and coastal lagoons (delimited by a semicircle of 2.5 km in the mouth), and at nursery areas (prohibited the use of gill-nets in June) in front of Playa Bagdad, Tamaulipas. There is a Marine Protected Area of 30 km from the Rio Bravo´s mouth to Conchinal; Terminos lagoon, Campeche; Usumacinta-Grijalva Rivers, Tabasco; Yalahau lagoon, Quintana Roo; and Espiritu Santo and Ascension Bays, Quintana Roo. There is also a Management Plan of the Natural Protected Area “Biosphere Reserve of the Mexican Caribbean” that prohibits any elasmobranch fishery in all this biosphere reserve that comprises all Mexican Caribbean. There are enforcement problems.<br/><br/>In the wider Caribbean, the Regional Office of Fisheries of the System of Integration (SICA), prohibits shark finning with the resolution OSP-05-11 in all of the Central American countries from Belize to Panama, including the Dominican Republic. In Belize, there are currently no conservation measures protecting sharks throughout territorial waters. Despite no-take restrictions in marine reserves, illegal fishing continues to take place and reef sharks are known to be caught. As such, increased enforcement is required in Belize's 13 marine reserves to specifically protect shark species against illegal fishing. Most sharks caught as bycatch in the hook and line fisheries could be released live but are usually landed. In Guatemala, there is a fishing ban for one month (usually August) for the capture of sharks (Families: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Triakidae, and Ginglymostomatidae) and two months (usually July and August) for rays (Family Dasyatidae). However, enforcement of these bans is a challenge.In Honduras, there is a national regulation (Governmental Decree 107-2011) that declared the territorial waters of Honduras a shark sanctuary. Fishing and exploitation of all shark species was prohibited in all territorial waters of Honduras. This regulation was revised by a new regulation (Governmental Decree 26-2016), which indicated that sharks that are incidentally caught can be used. There are enforcement problems.<br/><br/>Currently, there are some Marine Protected Areas in the middle and west of the Caribbean coast of Panama (e.g. Portobelo National Park, Bastimentos Island National Marine Park). These protected areas provide a certain level of ecosystem management through implementing control over local fisheries and providing protection for critical habitats (e.g. coral reefs, mangrove), both of these measures can benefit shark populations. Despite the creation of these marine parks, enforcement of protective initiatives in these areas is a challenge. In addition to the creation of Marine Protected Areas, Panama has established nationwide conservation and management policies for the fisheries industry. In 2006, an official regulation was approved that prohibits shark finning in Panama waters. In 2017, new regulations were implemented for longline fisheries (e.g. limits of the number of hooks to 1,000 per surface longline strand), which will help to further contribute to the conservation and management of sharks in Panama.<br/><br/>The archipelago of San Andrés y Providencia, Colombia, was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2000, and covers an area of 180,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(i.e., 10% of the total area of the Caribbean Sea) and comprises some of the most productive and biodiverse reefs in the region. Since 2008, all shark species have been fully protected in the Seaﬂower Biosphere Reserve, banning ﬁshing and possession of all sharks and their byproducts. These has led to one of the highest shark abundances found in the Caribbean Sea. Local communities pushed for these shark conservation measures in the Archipelago, simplifying the enforcement by local authorities. Enforcement in remote regions against poaching has been challenging, although the Colombian Navy has been leading the enforcement of these areas and has enabled scientific data collection. In addition, Colombia has banned wire-leaders on their longlining ﬁsheries as a bycatch-reduction measure across the entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), where industrial ﬁsheries are only allowed to have a total shark by catch of 35% in a single ﬁshing trip. Finning is prohibited within the Colombia EEZ and ﬁns are required to be attached naturally to the body at landing.<br/><br/>Antilles, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago developed draft NPOA – Sharks in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. However, for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, these are still in draft form due to a combination of factors including lack of political will. For the Dutch Caribbean, spatial management measures have been implemented. The Yarari Marine Mammal and Shark Sanctuary was created in 2015 for Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba in the Caribbean Netherlands. In November 2011, the Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (MoU Sharks) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. In Brazil, this species is part of the National Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks and Marine Skates Threatened by Extinction and is protected in some conservation units: Rio Grande do Norte (REBIO of the Atol das Rocas) Pernambuco (Fernando de Noronha Marine Park, APA Fernando de Noronha - Rocas - São Paulo Pedro and São Paulo; and in Bahia (PARNA Marinho dos Abrolhos) (ICMBio 2018).<br/>  <p>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is listed as Critically Endangered because it has experienced a population reduction of over 99% over the last two generations; its area of occupancy is less than 10 km<sup>2</sup>, its population is severely fragmented, and in continuing decline; and there number of mature individuals is less than 50.</p>","According to Heude (1880), some of the specimens he described were caught in the Huangpu River (the largest river flowing through Shanghai and the last significant tributary of the Yangtze before it empties into the East China Sea), and some in and on the shores of Tai Hu near Suzhou. All these wetlands are interconnected through the Grand Canal, the oldest and longest canal in the world with a history of over 2,500 years. The Yangtze subpopulation therefore appears to have inhabited lowland lakes and rivers in the Yangtze coastal plain. Pritchard (2012), reviewing records of the species in Viet Nam, describes it as cryptic, fairly sedentary, inhabiting sluggish or still waters associated with major rivers, shuffled into the mud and detritus on the bottom, and eating almost anything organic. Wang <em>et al. </em>(2013) reviewed the habitat selection of <em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> in the upper Red River, China, and demonstrated that they were mainly recorded in river sections with sandbars and in particular at confluences of tributaries with the main river where the water was deeper. They seem to occur in deep sections of large rivers, in backwaters and in lakes. The two known live wild individuals in Viet Nam both live in semi-artificial lakes (dammed back with barrier structures).&#160;The captive <em>R. swinhoei </em>in China accepts animal matter like fish, various mammalian meats, chicken, crayfish, snails, salad and other plants, and also sadly junk food thrown into his pond by visitors&#160;(Kuchling <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). At least adults of the species are omnivorous. The female in China preferred to nest on open, sunny sand banks and avoided different soil and vegetation cover (Kuchling unpublished), but nothing is known of nest site selection in the wild. Nothing is also known on the biology and habitat selection of hatchlings and juveniles.<br/><br/>The Yangtze female was well over 90 years of age at the time of death and usually laid three, sometimes four, clutches per year of 55 to 65 (infertile) eggs each. This suggests a generation time of at least 100 years.","<p><em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> remains under extreme pressure from exploitation of adults and eggs for (subsistence) consumption and targeted capture attempts in recent years due to its increased value. In addition, it has been affected by habitat loss through conversion, drainage, fragmentation and pollution of wetlands and riparian habitats, and hydroelectric barrages and sand mining.</p>","<p>An adult male of the Yangtze population has been kept for decades at the Suzhou Zoo in China. A female in the same zoo died in April 2018 and had mated many times with the male without producing fertile eggs. A male of the Red River subpopulation inhabited for a long time Hoan Kiem Lake in downtown Hanoi, Viet Nam, but died in January 2016. Another individual of the Red River subpopulation of unknown sex inhabits Dong Mo Lake west of Hanoi (subsequently captured in October 2020 and confirmed to be a female; WCS 2020) and a further individual was recently confirmed by eDNA in Xuan Khanh Lake, not far from Hanoi and Dong Mo Lake (Asian Turtle Program Press Release 11th April 2018). Surveys of the Red River basin in both Yunnan and Viet Nam in recent years have hinted at the possible survival of one or more animals, at least until recent times, but had not documented confirmed additional living animals until the capture of a female in October 2020. While the species has declined substantially over recent historical times, extensive records were known from the Red River subpopulation in both China and Viet Nam from the 1960s until the 1990s (Pritchard 2012). The last records from the lower Yangtze River region date from the 1930s. The decline accelerated greatly with increased agricultural and industrial development since the 1980s, and assuming a generation time of 100 years, has probably declined by over 99% over the past two generations.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Historical records for <em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> exist from throughout the Red River basin of Yunnan and Viet Nam, as well as the coastal plains of northern Viet Nam. The species is also known from the lower Yangtze lowlands of eastern China. Based on late Pleistocene and Holocene fossils from Zhejiang and Taiwan Straits, speculatively it may historically have occurred in the Pearl River system and other drainages between northern Viet Nam and the Yangtze delta.<br/><br/>At the time of assessment, the current distribution in the wild was limited to two animals in reservoirs near Hanoi; the possibility remained of rediscovery in other northern Vietnamese wetlands. In October 2020, a female turtle was captured in a Dong Mo Lake near Hanoi and the genetic results confirmed it to be this species (WCS 2020).

Heavy droughts, predatory non-native crayfish, several introduced exotic fish species, Tilapia farming and recreational activities have been identified as main threats. The known extant sites are the Ojo de Agua Los Berros springs and a spring on a private property in La Constancia. <br/><br/>The species is categorized as Critically Endangered (CR) based on its restricted EOO and its single location (mainly defined by threats posed by introduced species).","The species occurs in marshy pools, spring-fed ponds, springs and their outflows with abundant submerged vegetation (<em>Myriophyllum</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum</em>, <em>Potamogeton </em>and <em>Scirpus</em>) or none.  Concerning the substrates predominate silt, clay, mud, sand, soft marl,  gravel and rocks. The currents are usually slight to none,  occasionally moderate, the water is clear to turbid. The Rainbow  Characodon prefers depths of less than 0.5 m (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The spring-fed pond on a private property in La Constancia is about 3 x 5 m in diameter, deep down to 1.5 m. It is completely surrounded by rock walls except for the outlet, which squeezes through some roots of <em>Taxodium</em> sp. The ground was made of sand and gravel with several rocks and boulders along the walls.&#160;<em>Characodon lateralis</em> has been found on a survey by Köck <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2015) in very small numbers (M. Köck pers. comm. 2018). The only other fish species that occured in this pond was <em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>, the Green Swordtail (M. Köck pers. comm. 2018). This species is non-native to Durango and outnumbered the Goodeids by about 4:1. The outlet merged into a concrete pond that is usually used for Tilapia husbandry, but at the time of the visit, there was only one specimen. No Rainbow Goodeids could be found in this shallow pond (depth around 0.5 m). After several metres and a dam, the Tilapia pond became a shallow creek with a width of about 2 m and 20 - 30 cm depth. No <em>Characodon</em> were visible from the bank, but the creek was not surveyed accurately.&#160;<br/><br/>Several springs occur in the village of Los Berros or Ojo de Agua Los Berros. The habitat, the group around Köck <em>et al</em>. surveyed in 2015 was in the south directly at the street (M. Köck pers. comm. 2018). It had a size of 20 x 15 m and 50 cm deep with the ground made of sand and mud with rocks. Patches of green algae were the only vegetation, partly floating on the surface. Only afew <em>Characodon</em> were found here, but there were many introduced crayfish (<em>Procamabarus clarkii</em>). This predatory species is probably the reason for the low numbers in Goodeids. Five metres east of this main spring was a tiny spring with about one metre in diameter and a depth of 30 cm. Here, about 200 Rainbow Goodeids could be observed together with about the same number of non-native Green swordtails. A survey of the outlet of the two springs was inefficient, but difficult due to the swampy environmant and many submersed plants (<em>Bacopa</em> sp.). Other springs outlets were not surveyed.","The extant population of the Rainbow Goodeid is threatened by exotic species, mainly through predation through introduced crayfish (<em>Procambarus clarkii</em>) hunting in the dark on the ground where <em>Charadodon lateralis</em> sleeps, by competition through non-native Green swordtails (<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>) and Tilapia, in addition to water pollution through urban sewage, water exaction for agriculture and recreational activities of the local community.<br/><br/>The spring-fed pond (in San Juán close to Los Berros) was a habitat of this Goodeid species until about 2013, but is now completely populated with introduced fish species that probably extirpated <em>Characodon lateralis</em> and even the abundant submersed vegetation. During a survey by Köck <em>et al. </em>(2015), the encountered species were: <em>Astyanax mexicanus</em>, <em>Poecilia mexicana</em>, <em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>, <em>Oreochromis</em> sp. and <em>Gambusia</em> sp (M. Köck pers. comm. 2018). Some channels south and south-east of the Ojo de Agua de San Juán were also surveyed and displayed the same species, but no Rainbow Goodeid.&#160;<br/><br/>The only historically known habitat in Amado Nervo was a small spring surrounded by reed. During a few dry years, it silted up, and after the outlet creek dried up in 2006, the species disappeared completely. During a survey by Köck <em>et al. </em>(2015), the spring no longer existed: only a swampy reed remained (M. Köck pers. comm. 2018). The emanative water was dammed and the pond stocked with non-native Sunfish and Tilapia. A big, but shallow, lagoon following the outlet of the small dam was stocked with Tilapia and predatory crayfish (<em>Procambarus clarkii</em>). The narrow creek (30 cm wide, 5 - 10 cm deep) following the lagoon didn't reveal any fish.","The population of <em>Characodon lateralis</em> can be divided into two subpopulations. The status of the distinct subpopulations are:<em></em><br/><br/>Amado Nervo subpopulation: This subpopulation was restricted to a spring E of Amado Nervo that became dry in about 2012. Since this time, no specimen has been found on several surveys (last by Köck&#160;<em>et al.</em> in 2015, M. Köck&#160;pers. comm. 2018). A subsequent pond revealed Sunfish and <em>Gambusia sp.</em>, the following lagoon Tilapia and <em>Procambarus clarkii </em>(predatory introduced crayfish). This subpopulation is regarded Extinct in the Wild as several captive stocks are known.&#160;<br/><br/>Los Berros subpopulation: This subpopulation was historically widely distributed in springs and creeks N and W of Nombre de Díos. Recent surveys (last by Köck <em>et al.</em> in 2015, M. Köck pers. comm. 2018) suggest, that this species only occurs in a tiny spring on a private property in La Constancia with less than 100 individuals and in springs in (Ojo de Agua) Los Berros. In one surveyed spring, it occurred in very low numbers, a very close by one with a diameter of probably a metre revealed maybe 200 individuals together with introduced <em>Xiphophoeus hellerii</em> (Green Swordtails).

It is historically known from an area directly north of the town of Nombre de Díos encompassing the Río La Villa and the Arroyo Las Compuertas including some large springs like the Ojo de Agua Los Berros and the Ojo de Agua de San Juán. Furthermore, it was known from a spring and its effluent in Amado Nervo, that drains into the Arroyo La Ciénega, an affluent of the Río La Villa in Nombre de Díos. It disappeared from Amado Nervo due to a heavy drought and from several other historically known places like the Ojo de Agua de San Juán, probably due to exotic fish species.

3009637,46583,Alligator mississippiensis,Least Concern,,2019,2018-10-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The American alligator (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>) occupies all of its historical range at or close to carrying capacity. The population is abundant and is currently considered to be stable (or growing) at between 0.75 and 1.06 million adults that are well protected and managed. Sustainable use programmes for this species are in place with well implemented monitoring programmes. Therefore, it remains in the Least Concern category.","<p></p><p>The ecology of <em>A. mississippiensis </em>is one of the best-known of all crocodilian species (see Joanen and McNease 1987; Mazzotti and Brandt 1994). Maximum adult sizes rarely exceed 4.5 m total length (TL) for males and 3.0 m TL for females (Woodward <em>et al. </em>1995; Brunell <em>et al.</em> 2015). The name “alligator” presumably derives from a corruption of the Spanish word “el lagarto”. The work of McIlhenny (1935) in Louisiana was among the ﬁrst to document some of the remarkable aspects of the natural history of this species. Studies on alligator social behaviour have demonstrated a remarkable degree of complexity in the species’ ability to communicate vocally, through bellows and headslaps, and visually through a complex series of body postures (Garrick <em>et al</em>. 1978; Vliet 1989, 2001).</p>  <p>Females become sexually mature at 1.8-2.1 m TL and 10-16 years of age depending on climate and habitat productivity (Joanen and McNease 1989; Woodward <em>et al</em>. 1992; Wilkinson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Courtship and mating take place during the spring (April-May) warming period. Nest construction and egg-laying occur in June and early July (Joanen and McNease 1989; Woodward <em>et al.</em> 1989). Females construct a mound nest of vegetation or peat and lay an average of 30-50 eggs, depending on age and size of the female, and habitat quality. Incubation of eggs takes 63-84 days, depending on temperature (Lang and Andrews 1994), and young hatch in late August or early September. Females typically open the nest to help the young emerge, and will remain near the pod of hatchlings for up to 9 months and sometimes longer. In some cases, hatchlings overwinter with the female in dens, a burrow they excavate in thick vegetation or mud.</p>  <p>In some habitats, alligators use dens as refuges during droughts or winter freezes for protection against severe weather conditions. In marsh ecosystems, alligators create and maintain small ponds, called “alligator holes”, which play an important ecological role by providing both wetter and drier habitats for alligators and other organisms (Campbell and Mazzotti 2004). Alligators are one of the most temperate species of crocodilians, and are known to survive short spells of below-freezing weather by resting in shallow water with their snouts at the surface, thus keeping a breathing hole open in the surrounding ice (Brisbin <em>et al</em>. 1982).</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>The main threats to alligators are habitat degradation due to expanding agriculture and residential development, nutrient and chemical pollution (Woodward&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011), saltwater intrusion and flooding, and water diversion (Mazzotti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Several hurricanes (Katrina and Rita in 2005 and Gustav and Ike in 2008) had short-term negative effects on alligators in coastal Louisiana and Texas, but this resilient species rapidly recovered to normal population distribution and abundance (Elsey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008). Human-alligator conflict is arguably a threat to alligator conservation efforts.</p><br/><p></p>","<p>The American alligator is an outstanding example of the application of sustainable use for the successful conservation of a crocodilian species. Although heavily exploited since the 1800s, and classified as endangered in the 1960s, populations responded well to Federal and State laws in the United States, enacted during the early 1970s to prohibit illegal trade in alligator skins. Subsequent implementation of management programmes throughout the alligator’s range have further enhanced population recovery. Extensive surveys of alligator populations have been undertaken throughout the species’ range. Annual monitoring of numerous localities is conducted as part of sustainable use programmes in most range states. Overall, alligator populations are healthy. Populations remain in most historical localities, and the species is widely distributed and abundant throughout its range. Populations in the majority of surveyed locations are stable or growing, even under the imposition of sustainable harvests (see accounts and references in Use and Trade section below). Oklahoma is the only State that restricts management of alligators to protection-only. Owing to increasing alligator populations and expanding human populations, programmes to control alligators that pose a threat to people or domestic animals (termed “nuisance” alligators) are an integral part of alligator management programmes (Woodward and David 1994, King and Elsey, 2014). The current total wild population is estimated to be 3-4 million non-hatchling alligators. Survey results suggest approximately 26.5% of these are adult sized (Woodward <em>et al</em>. 1992).</p>",Increasing,"The breeding range of the American alligator (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>) is distributed in southeastern United States of America in the states of Arkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,&#160;Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma,&#160;and Texas. Within this range, <em>A. mississippiensis</em>&#160;inhabit freshwater swamps, lakes, marshes and streams. They also inhabit brackish water habitats and, although they have a low tolerance for salt water, they will occasionally use marine environments for feeding (Rosenblatt and Heithaus&#160;2011).","<p>Sustainable harvest management programmes have been operating in Louisiana, Florida and Texas for many years. More recently, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas have implemented sustainable harvest programs for larger alligators. Louisiana, Florida and Texas allow the collection of wild eggs for captive rearing and harvest (ranching). Farming and ranching are now being carried out on a large scale, particularly in Louisiana and Florida. Stocks in over 100 commercial farms and ranches throughout the country are high, with over 923,000 alligators on farms in Louisiana alone in 2016. Captive breeding (farming) produces about 45,000 hatchlings annually. Commercial production of skins is highly regulated with a coordinated system of permits, licenses, periodic stock inventories, ranch inspections, and rigorous tagging and export permit requirements.</p>  <p><u>Louisiana</u>: Utilization is primarily in the form of egg collection for ranches and a managed hunt that utilizes seasonal habitat segregation of female alligators into less accessible parts of the range to focus the hunt on males (65-75% of the harvest; Elsey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994, 2004). The wild harvest typically generates 30,000-35,000 skins annually. Hunting quotas are controlled by allocating a number of tags to each licensed hunter, based on the area and quality of alligator habitat and population estimates based on aerial nest surveys. Egg collection from private and state-owned lands has typically provided 350,000-500,000 eggs annually to ranches in recent years; although ideal habitat conditions led to ranching of over 616,000 eggs in 2016. Ten percent of the animals commercially ranched (~1.2 m TL) are required to be returned to the wild. Skin production from ranches has ranged from 250,000- 300,000 per year in recent years.</p>  <p><u>Florida</u>: The Florida programme includes farming, hunting and nuisance alligator control, as well as egg and hatchling harvests for ranching. Controlled hunting and egg collection on both private and public lands are based on harvest allocations generated from annual spotlight surveys and nest counts for each area (David&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996; Dutton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002). Long-term studies on harvested wetlands demonstrate that alligator populations remain stable when up to 6% of alligators &gt;1.8 m TL are harvested annually (Woodward&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992) or up to 50% of located nests are collected for ranching (Rice&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999). Harvest quotas based on annual monitoring of population density is an integral part of the programme. Annual production of skins in Florida is approximately 20,000 from wild alligators and 30,000 from farming/ranching. In recent years, 50,000-100,000 eggs and hatchlings have been transferred to farms in other range states for rearing and harvest.</p>  <p><u>Other states</u>: Texas allows wild harvest of up to 2000 larger alligators per year, and egg collection for ranching, which results in an average annual production of about 15,000 skins. South Carolina's programme allows controlled hunting on private lands (Rhodes 1996, 2002) and public waters. Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas have also conducted successful regulated hunts in recent years.</p>  <p>In most range states, nuisance alligator control is achieved by licensed trappers who, acting under the direction of state wildlife agencies, respond to public complaints of nuisance alligators (Woodward and David 1994, King and Elsey 2014). Nuisance alligators are captured or trapped, and in most instances killed and their skin and meat sold to defray costs. These programmes have converted an expensive animal control programme into a mostly self-ﬁnanced public service that provides increased safety to the public who live or recreate in alligator habitat.</p>  <p>Sustainable use of alligators in the USA generates more than&#160;US100 million dollars annually at the raw product level, providing a&#160;substantial incentive for the public to retain habitat and live with alligators. Fees from the regulatory system provide funding for management, regulation, enforcement, and research programmes on alligators.</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<span lang=""EN-US""><p></p><p>Alligators are listed on Appendix II of CITES and as Threatened on the US Endangered Species Act. International trade is regulated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through CITES. However, on-the-ground conservation and management is delegated to each U.S. state which sets protective and harvest regulations. The alligator benefits from a very large number of protected habitats in state and national parks and other protected areas, but a large proportion of the population occurs in unprotected habitat and on privately-owned lands. Conservation has been achieved by protecting key habitat, regulating harvest at sustainable levels and providing economic incentives for private land-owners to maintain habitat. A constituency of individuals and business interests that derive benefit from alligators support their conservation and provides funding, both directly and by use and access fees, to support conservation. Effective management of 'nuisance alligators' has also broadened public support and tolerance of alligators, despite instances of alligator predation on pets, livestock and occasionally humans. Recommendations for research and conservation to address current and future threats include:<br/> 1.&#160;&#160; <strong>Investigations on the effects of water management in the Everglades ecosystem: </strong>The construction of a network of canals in the greater Everglades ecosystem of Florida during the early part of the 1900s altered hydrological patterns and the long-term productivity of alligators in that ecosystem. Alligator ecology investigations, as part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, have been conducted since the 1990s and are still underway to measure the long-term effects of hydrological restoration of this ecosystem (Mazzotti <em>et al.</em> 2009). </p><p>2.&#160;&#160; <strong>Research on human dimensions in alligator conservation</strong>: Alligators present a bone fide safety threat to humans and their domestic animals. State alligator management programmes have been challenged in recent years with trying to maintain public safety while keeping alligator populations at levels that conserve the species and allow sustainable harvests for commercial and recreational purposes. Research into approaches to optimize the ecological, aesthetic, and economic values of alligators while maintaining public safety is needed.</p><p>3.&#160;<strong>&#160; Investigations on population biology</strong>: The presence of healthy alligator<em> </em>populations, and the availability of institutional and ﬁnancial resources, have led to numerous investigations of alligator biology over many years. Although the American alligator is the most thoroughly studied of all crocodilians, we still know relatively little about its population dynamics in the wild. A better understanding of the population ecology of this species would not only beneﬁt the management of alligators but other large crocodilian species as well. These investigations are facilitated and ﬁnanced by the presence of management programmes such as cropping and ranching, and are currently underway in several states. For example, a recent long-term study on growth and reproductive lifespan demonstrated female alligators can nest for up to 46 years, and that alligators commonly live to 50 and can possibly over 70 years (Wilkinson <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p><p>4.&#160;&#160; <strong>Research on husbandry techniques: </strong>Because of the extensive commercial ranching and farming industry in the USA, the American alligator is a prime candidate for research on captive husbandry. Incubation and rearing techniques need to be improved to increase the efficiency of the alligator ranching industry. Extensive research on these topics is currently underway, particularly in Louisiana (Reigh and Williams 2016) and Florida.</p><p>        5.&#160;&#160; <strong>Research on international market dynamics of alligator skin prices:</strong>&#160; The economic stability of state alligator management programmes is largely dependent on revenues generated from the sale of skins and meat from harvested alligators. Low skin prices over the past several years have constrained alligator farming, wild harvest, and nuisance control enterprises, jeopardizing the ability of states to maintain alligator management and conservation programmes at optimum levels. A better understanding of alligator skin production supply chains, as well as supply and demand dynamics. will help both government and private participants in alligator management to understand and adapt to changing economic conditions.</p><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
3047556,5668,Crocodylus porosus,Least Concern,,2021,2019-11-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a species, the global population of <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> is secure because of large populations, extensive habitat and effective management in Australia, Papua New Guinea and, to a lesser degree, Indonesia. There are increasing <em>C. porosus </em>populations in the Solomon Islands, Sarawak and Sabah due to effective protection measures, although management may require incentives derived from sustainable use in order to counter negative public attitudes towards them.","<em>Crocodylus porosus</em> is considered the largest of the living crocodilians, with reported lengths of up to 6–7 m (Webb and Manolis 1989, 2009; Whitaker and Whitaker 2008). <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> preys on people when given the opportunity. It is one of the most widely distributed of all crocodilians, ranging from southern India and Sri Lanka, throughout southeast Asia, east through the Philippines to Micronesia, and down through Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands to northern Australia.<br/><br/>Within this distribution, <em>C. porosus </em>occupies a wide of wetland habitats from the sea (including thousands of islands) to hundreds of kilometres inland. A great deal of ecological research was carried out in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Contrary to its common name “Saltwater crocodile”, which implies a marine existence, the species commonly inhabits non-tidal freshwater sections of rivers, and inland freshwater lakes, swamps and marshes. Indeed, it thrives in freshwater environments and some of the highest densities of <em>C. porosus </em>have been reported from heavily vegetated freshwater swamps without any tidal inﬂuence (Webb et al. 1977; 1984). Breeding and recruitment take place principally in rivers with signiﬁcant freshwater input, or in freshwater swamps (Jelden 1981, Webb <em>et al</em>. 1983, Cox 1985). In the marine environment it mostly inhabits tidal rivers and creeks, where salinity changes with different seasons and distance upstream, but they regularly move around the coast between rivers and occupy offshore islands.<br/><br/>Long-distance voyages at sea occur (Allen 1974, Manolis 2005) with unknown frequency (e.g. Cox 1985; Jelden 1985; Webb <em>et al</em>. 1984, 1987; Messel and Vorlicek 1989; Webb and Manolis 1989, 2009). Historical and recent data suggest that individuals move between range states (e.g. Malaysia-Singapore, Australia-Timor Leste). However, the species demonstrates high site fidelity, with long distance movements usually associated with translocated adults, or sub-adult and sub-dominant crocodiles dispersing in search of a territory. Individual crocodiles are also known to travel long distances between breeding and non-breeding sites (&gt;100 km) as well as to and from seasonal feeding sites (e.g. sea turtle nesting). The exact nature of these movements is not well known.<br/><br/>In the tidal waterways of northern Australia, the movement of <em>C. porosus </em>between river systems appears to be related to sex and ontogenetic changes in social status. Radio and satellite tracking of large, male <em>C. porosus </em>are now providing insights into the pattern of movement out of rivers onto the coast, between river systems, and within tidal and non-tidal habitats, including homing associated with relocated individuals (Read <em>et al</em>. 2007, Kay 2004, Brien <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, a recent study involving the genetic analyses of <em>C. porosus</em> nests along the Northern Territory coast, combined with satellite tracking data from five translocated adult males, revealed that the Coburg Peninsula appears to be a significant geographical barrier to movement and dispersal of <em>C. porosus </em>from the east and west of the Northern Territory (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>While the species is highly territorial, they are known to congregate at times of the year when resources are abundant. There are multiple reports of large numbers of adult crocodiles congregating around dead cattle floating in rivers of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. At Shady Camp lagoon on the Mary River, Northern Territory, large numbers (&gt;100) of sub-adult and adult crocodiles have been reported congregating at a barrage separating tidal from non-tidal waters when mullet are spawning. A similar occurrence happens on islands and beaches of northern Australia each year during sea turtle nesting seasons (e.g. green, flatback, etc.).<br/><br/>In the Northern Territory of Australia, the recovery of wild <em>C. porosus </em>populations following protection (1971) was carefully documented, providing new information on population dynamics. Increasing numbers of large crocodiles over time have been accompanied by decreasing numbers of small crocodiles (Webb and Manolis 1992, Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2011), which are predated or excluded from rivers and sometimes forced into marginal habitats, including upstream freshwater areas used for recreation by people (Letnic and Connors 2006).<br/><br/>Female <em>C. porosus </em>mature at around 2.2–2.5 m (12+ years of age in the wild). They lay their eggs in a mound of vegetation during the annual wet season (October-May; Webb <em>et al</em>. 1977, 1983). Mean clutch size in Australia is around 50 eggs at 113 g per egg (Webb <em>et al</em>. 1983), whereas in Papua New Guinea it is around 60 eggs at 100 g per egg (Cox et al. 2006). Incubation is typically 80-90 days (depending on temperature). As nesting is a wet season activity, loss of nests due to ﬂooding is typically very high (Webb et al. 1983; Cox 1985). Some wild females actively defend their nests and loss of eggs to non-human predators is exceptionally low. Lizards (varanids) take eggs, but usually when the eggs are dead and rotten, and can be located by smell. The recent invasion of Cane Toads (<em>Rhinella marina</em>) into the Northern Territory has reduced the varanid population which reduces this egg predation risk. The loss of very small numbers of eggs to rodents has been recorded (WMI, unpublished data), and wild pigs have been reported to raid <em>C. porosus </em>nests, but the signiﬁcance of this has not been demonstrated.<br/><p>  </p>","<p></p><strong>Human-crocodile conflict (HCC)</strong> – The largest risk posed to successful <em>C. porosus </em>conservation is the cohabitation of humans with an apex predator. Public awareness and education programs can help alleviate parts of this threat such as “Be CrocWise” (Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia in Australia). However, when <em>C. porosus </em>and humans are forced to cohabit, and even compete for resources (e.g. fishing), the risk of conflict will increase. Innovative solutions to further mitigate these risks are urgently required for continued conservation success.<br/><br/><strong>Land use</strong> – <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> attack cattle and other livestock as they drink at the water’s edge. Pastoralists involved in the Northern Territory of Australia’s egg and wild harvests are compensated to some degree for stock losses, and are also provided with incentives to conserve habitats. Elsewhere, retaliation killings occur as crocodiles threaten the livelihoods of local people. Fishermen inadvertently trap and kill crocodiles with fishing equipment (hooks and nets).<br/><br/><strong>Food </strong>– Unregulated fishing may be depleting fish stocks in some range states, which could have detrimental effects on <em>C. porosus </em>populations both from resource competition and increasing interactions leading to HCC.<br/><br/><strong>Invasive weeds </strong>– Introduced plants for the pastoral industry including Para Grass (<em>Urochloa mutica</em>) in northern Australia have a high heat during decomposition which increases the temperature experienced by the developing embryos within the nest. No research into the effects on embryo survival or resultant sex ratios has been conducted to know if detrimental impacts could result. Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipe</em>) is also a reported as a problem in Sri Lanka (Samarasinghe and Chandrasiri 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Invasive pests </strong>– No detrimental impacts on Australian <em>C. porosus </em>from the introduced Cane Toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>) have been reported so far (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2016). Feral pigs and buffalo are known to have impacted negatively on nesting in some areas in northern Australia, but the significance has not been quantified (C. Manolis, pers. comm. 2019). In Papua New Guinea, introduced ﬁsh species (<em>Piaractus brachypomus </em>and <em>Barbonymus gonionotus</em>) to degrade nesting habitats (Cox <em>et al</em>. 2006, G. Solmu, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Habitat destruction and pollution</strong> – Urban encroachment, sand mining, tourism and agriculture threaten habitat modification for <em>C. porosus </em>as well as pollutants (Samarasinghe and Chandrasiri 2013, Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. 2015) in some range states.<br/><br/><strong>Traditional harvesting </strong>– Some traditional harvesting occurs by indigenous peoples throughout the range states but poses little threat to the overall <em>C. porosus </em>populations.<br/><p></p>","The total wild population of <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> is estimated to be in excess of 400,000 non-hatchlings. As a species, the global population of <em>C. porosus</em> is secure because of large populations, extensive habitat and effective management in Australia, Papua New Guinea and to a lesser degree Indonesia (mainly Papua and West Papua Provinces). There are increasing <em>C. porosus</em> populations in the Solomon Islands and Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah) due to effective protection measures and future management may require incentives derived from sustainable use to counter growing negative public attitudes due to human-crocodile conflict (HCC). Reintroduction and protection efforts in Bhitarkanika National Park, India, have been successful although increasing HCC is now occurring. In contrast, re-establishment of populations outside of protected areas in India may never be possible due to the large human population and lack of suitable habitat. Likewise, re-establishment of wild populations of <em>C. porosus</em> in Thailand, Viet Nam and Cambodia, where the species has long been presumed extinct, is unlikely, even in protected areas.<br/><br/>The species has the most commercially valuable skin of any crocodilian (Fuchs 2006) and was intensively hunted for skins historically throughout its range, particularly from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. Restoration of depleted populations have been demonstrated to recover reasonably quickly if: (1) habitats are intact; (2) they are given the opportunity through effective protection; and (3) people are prepared to tolerate expanded populations. Examples are the populations in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia which have also implemented successful sustainable use models to assist in this recovery. However, elsewhere these preconditions have not been met. Habitat loss continues to be a major problem in many areas occupied by <em>C. porosus</em>, and frequently they are killed as pests regardless of whether their skin is used commercially or not. Another significant source of mortality is drowning in fishing nets, especially in river systems where commercial net fishing occurs (eg. northern Australia). Therefore, resourceful incentives will be required to enhance the tolerance of people co-existing with these apex predators with HCC considered the largest risk to their continued abundance.<br/><br/>Information on the current status of <em>C. porosus</em> in each range state is summarized as:<br/><br/><strong>Australia</strong><br/>Surveys by Professor Harry Messel and colleagues established the baseline for crocodile monitoring in northern Australia in the 1970s (e.g. Messel <em>et al</em>. 1978-1987). The population was protected (Western Australia 1970; Northern Territory 1971; Queensland 1974) after intensive unregulated hunting commenced in 1945-46. The recovering Australian population was transferred to CITES Appendix II (for ranching) under Resolution Conf. 3.15 in 1985 (Webb <em>et al</em>. 1984), and was given an unqualiﬁed Appendix-II listing in 1994 (under the old Berne Criteria, as Resolution Conf. 9.24 was only agreed to in 1994, at the same CITES meeting). Australia is considered the most secure long-term stronghold for C. porosus throughout its range due to large tracts of relatively uninhabited land and a successful sustainable use program that lead to the exportation of nearly 35,000 skins in 2015 (Caldwell 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>Northern Territory</em></strong>: Spotlight surveys carried out since the early 1970s indicate that in some rivers the population continues to increase, whereas in others the numbers have stabilized (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2011) despite high levels of legal egg harvest (ranching program) in almost all river systems (Saalfeld <em>et al</em>. 2016). The size structure is now biased towards larger animals (&gt;2 m), and total crocodile biomass continues to increase, even in rivers where numbers have stabilized (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2011). The total population in the Northern Territory is considered to be near pre-exploitation levels with an average of five non-hatchling crocodiles per km (Webb <em>et al</em>. 2000, Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2011, Saalfeld <em>et al</em>. 2016). A sustainable use program based on ranching of wild eggs forms the basis of management (Leach <em>et al</em>. 2009, Saalfeld <em>et al</em>. 2016), combined with a program of problem crocodile removal (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2014) and a limited wild harvest by landowners. Recognising the public impact of living with a large predator, the Northern Territory government runs a public education program called “Be Crocwise” to reduce HCC (<a href=""https://becrocwise.nt.gov.au"">becrocwise.nt.gov.au</a>). Eight farms are currently in operation and crocodiles were estimated to add $54.3 million to the Northern Territory economy from direct and indirect contributions of employment, capital expenditure and tourism (Ernst and Young 2017). There is no evidence that introduced cane toads (Rhinella marina) have impacted on C. porosus at all (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2016). Buffalo are known to have impacted negatively on nesting in some areas in northern Australia, but the significance has not been quantified (C. Manolis, pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/><strong><em>Western Australia</em></strong>: Major <em>C. porosus </em>populations occur in the northwest of the state. Between 1992 and 2012, the population monitoring program was based on an annual aerial survey in the Cambridge Gulf (Ord River, West Arm), with spotlight surveys carried out less regularly in some areas (Mawson 2004). Regular monitoring is currently restricted to an annual spotlight survey of the King River, which has been surveyed fairly consistently since 1989 (1989–1990, 1992–2015, 2017–2019; WMI 2019a). Helicopter surveys indicated a 5.1% per annum (p.a.) population increase in the Ord River (2000–2008) and a 4.1% increase in West Arm (1999–2008) with no signs that the populations were approaching stability (WMI 2008). Recent spotlight surveys of the Ord River in 2019 suggest that the population in the tidal mainstream may be approaching stability, but the population in the upstream non-tidal mainstream continues to increase significantly (WMI 2019b). In 2015, spotlight surveys of the Prince Regent, Hunter and Roe Rivers confirmed healthy breeding populations with a 300% increase in abundance since 1970 (Parke 2015). Cattle grazing is a potential threat to some nesting habitats, and some illegal harvesting of eggs is known to have occurred in 2009–2010.<br/><br/>The increasing <em>C. porosus </em>population has prompted authorities to implement a public safety program, similar to the “Be Crocwise” program in the Northern Territory (Parke 2017). Legal harvesting of juveniles, sub-adults, adults and eggs was undertaken in West Arm between 1989 and 1994 to provide stock for crocodile farms. However, only one farm is currently in operation, in Broome, and it is based solely on captive breeding.<br/><br/><em><strong>Queensland</strong></em>: There is a high-density human population on the east coast of Queensland and signiﬁcant habitat alteration for agriculture. The abundance of <em>C. porosus </em>varies between river systems, with the highest densities of crocodiles reported from northwest Cape York Peninsula (Read <em>et al</em>. 2004a, b). The most recent surveys (2009–2010) of 48 major waterways (735 km surveyed) along the east coast of Queensland revealed a relative density of 0.49±0.72 non-hatchlings/km (Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service 2010). For those individuals where size could be estimated (N=258), crocodiles ranged from hatchlings to 3.8 m, with 73% less than 2 m (13% were hatchlings). The number of non-hatchlings could be an under-estimate as 33% of crocodiles counted were “eyes only” which does not allow length to be estimated but tend to be larger, more wary crocodiles. On western Cape York Peninsula, surveys based in 10 key river systems in 2008 showed a relative density of 0.85 non-hatchlings/km with successful nesting occurring (Big Gecko, pers. comm. 2009). Identiﬁable threats to nesting success include feral pests (pigs) and invasive weeds.<br/><br/>Over the last ten years authorities have been under increasing public pressure to deal with increasing numbers of saltwater crocodiles in urban areas, which seems to be in response to more larger crocodiles moving around the coast, an increasing human population, and increased publicity and the ability to easily report sightings (Brien et al. 2017). The highest number of attacks, sightings, removals and relocations have occurred along the populated east coast between Townsville and the Daintree River during wet season months (November-February; Brien <em>et al</em>. 2017). There were 35 crocodile attacks in Queensland between 1971 and 2015 (total 0.8 per year; fatal 0.3 per year), mostly involving local people or regular visitors (77.1%), specifically adult males (71.4%; mean age 44 years; Brien <em>et al</em>. 2017). There has been an increase in the rate of crocodile attacks over time, with an average of 1.3 per year since 1996, most of which were non-fatal (84%; Brien <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In response, in 2017, the Queensland Government embarked on a 3-year monitoring program involving systematic spotlight and helicopter surveys in carefully selected, previously surveyed river systems throughout the state. This is the most comprehensive program since 2003, and will be used to determine the size, distribution and abundance and extent of recovery of the C. porosus population over time. Currently, the Queensland Crocodile Management Plan (<a href=""https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/87711/wl-mp-croc-manage-plan.pdf"">https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/87711/wl-mp-croc-manage-plan.pdf</a>) consists of six clearly defined zones, from Central to Far North Queensland, with management actions determined by the zone-specific risks of interactions between crocodiles and people. Similar to the Northern Territory problem crocodile program (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2014), any C. porosus that poses a threat to human safety is removed or relocated. So far, 608 crocodiles have been relocated although this number has fluctuated widely between years (range 1-57; Brien <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The utilization of crocodiles on Queensland farms is mostly limited to captive breeding, with some farms importing large numbers of Northern Territory and Western Australian sourced eggs and/or juvenile crocodiles. However, an important step towards improving the public perception of crocodile use was attained in late 2018 by a change in legislation (Nature Conservation Act 1994) to allow for a limited wild egg harvest program. Currently (2019) there is only one permit in place for this to occur in Pormpuraaw, northwestern Cape York.<br/><br/><strong>Bangladesh</strong><br/>In Bangladesh, <em>C. porosus</em> are restricted to the Sundarbans (Ganges delta). In 1982, four crocodiles and 20 tracks were recorded during daytime (450 km) and nighttime (95 km) surveys. In 2014–2015, daytime surveys in 351 km of river recorded 42 crocodiles (Aziz and Islam 2018). In 2016, 60 crocodiles and 31 tracks were recorded during the day in 1,893 km of river. Protected in 1974, the population was estimated to comprise 150–200 individuals in 1985, 250–300 adult <em>C. porosus </em>in 2000, and by 2012 it was considered to not exceed 100–150 adults (Rashid 2013). The reduction in the population is due to a variety of reasons, including an increasing human population, habitat alteration and illegal killing (eg ﬁshermen believe crocodiles compete with them for ﬁsh; Manik 2009). In February 1999, 14,300 ha (143 km²) or 2.3% of the Bangladesh Sundarbans was declared a wildlife sanctuary where extraction/collection of wildlife resources was banned. The sanctuary includes Kotka-Kochikhadi in East Sundarbans, Notabele in West Sundarbans, and Nikamol in South Sundarbans. <br/><br/>The Karamjal Crocodile Breeding Centre (KCBC) was established in 2000, and in 2016 breeding stock consisted of two females and one male (Anon 2016a). In early 2017, total stock comprised 215 crocodiles (Anon 2017) from this limited founder population. One of the goals of the KCBC is to make animals available for release into the wild. However, by early 2016, only about 19 <em>C. porosus </em>had been released into canals and rivers of the Sundarbans (Anon 2016b, Manik 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Brunei</strong><br/>Little information is available on the status of <em>C. porosus </em>in Brunei. Cox (2006) reported low numbers in most rivers and creeks in Brunei Bay (relative density of 0.33 individuals/km). Habitats are largely undisturbed so the biological potential for recovery exists if incentives for the local human population to accept increased numbers of crocodiles can be provided (Ibrahim and Cox 2006). There have been eight confirmed attacks by <em>C. porosus </em>on humans since 2006 (CrocBite 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Cambodia</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles are considered to be extinct in Cambodia. It is believed that <em>C. porosus </em>were extirpated from Tonle Sap Lake about 30–50 years ago (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2006) although some individuals may still exist in coastal areas (Thuok and Tang 1994, Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Ouk Vibol, pers. comm. 2017). Very few <em>C. porosus </em>are held on the 900+ crocodile farms in Cambodia (Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2005) with the local crocodile farming industry being based on the Siamese Crocodile (<em>C. siamensis</em>). Hybridization with <em>C. siamensis</em> is not a frequent occurrence (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>China</strong><br/>The presence of wild <em>C. porosus </em>in southern China is currently unknown. Farming operations on the mainland and on Hainan Island may still have some <em>C. porosus</em>, imported from range states such as Thailand (Chen 2001, Geng 2001, Li 2001).<br/><br/><strong>India</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles remain in the northeast coastal region of mainland India and the Andaman Islands (Kar 2013, Singh and Kar 2006). A “rear and release” program in Bhitarkanika National Park (BNP), Odisha State, has released more than 2,950 captive-reared juveniles (approximately 1 m long) between 1977 and 2015 and several released females are known to be nesting successfully (Kar 2017). As such, the <em>C. porosus </em>population in BNP has increased significantly since the reintroduction program started from 95 sightings in 1976/77 (relative density= 0.87/km) to 1682 sightings in 2017 (relative density= 13.4/km; Kar 2019). The number of nests has increased from five in the mid-1970s, to 65 in 2009, 70 in 2017, to 101 in 2019 (Kar 2009, 2017, 2019). BNP is considered to comprise around 75% of the total population of wild <em>C. porosus </em>in India (Kar 2019).<br/><br/>The population increase in BNP has led to increased dispersal and HCC (Padro and Padhi 2019). A team of crocodile husbandry and management staff at the Dangmal/Bhitarkanika Research Facility are now engaged to capture problem <em>C. porosus </em>and relocate them back to suitable locations within BNP (Anon 2008a). Previously, groups of captive-bred C. porosus were released by the Forest Department in the southern-most part of BNP, primarily as a deterrent strategy for human activities in the mangrove forest (Kar 2007).<br/><br/>Concerns about the potential impact of the Dhamara seaport and Rengali canal developments on BNP and its <em>C. porosus </em>population were raised previously (see Webb <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, Dhamara seaport has now been in operation since 2010 and does not appear to have had a detrimental effect on the crocodile population or its mangrove habitats. Studies conducted by government and non-government agencies on the impact of the Rengali Dam (upstream Brahmani River) on the flow of fresh water also highlighted negligible impact on mangrove ecosystems, including those in BNP, and at present there appears to be sufficient freshwater flow from both the Brahmani and other rivers (e.g. Baitrani and Kharasrota Rivers).<br/><br/>In the Indian portion of the Sundarbans in West Bengal, daytime surveys in January 2012 reported a relative density of 0.11 non-hatchlings/km (1,163 km), with a bias towards adults (49.3%) although this is typical of daytime surveys and is not considered to reflect the real population size structure (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2012). As of March 2012, more than 450 <em>C. porosus</em> had been bred at the Forest Department of West Bengal’s farm in the Sundarbans and released into the wild (Nagchoudhury 2012).<br/><br/>Although <em>C. porosus </em>are known to be widely distributed in areas with suitable breeding habitat (freshwater swamps), there are no recent data on the status of <em>C. porosus </em>in the Andaman Islands (Whitaker and Whitaker 1978, Andrews and Whitaker 1994). Human occupation is considered to be displacing crocodiles (Andrews and Whitaker 1994) and HCC is an increasing problem (Whitaker 2008, 2009; Giles 2015) that threatens tourism, which is the biggest industry in the islands. A review of management options for the Andaman Islands was conducted in July 2018 (G. Webb, pers. comm. 2018). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Indonesia</strong><br/>An extensive survey program was conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Indonesian CITES Management Authority (PHKA - Direktorat Jenderal Perlindungan Hutan dan Konservasi Alam) in the 1990s, but it did not provide an estimate of the total population of <em>C. porosus </em>within Indonesia, nor its distribution across the archipelago nation (CITES 1994). The stronghold for <em>C. porosus </em>is West Papua and Papua Provinces, particularly the Mamberano River drainage in the north. Past human exploitation and habitat alteration have reduced the population of <em>C. porosus </em>throughout much of Indonesia, although localities in Sumatra and the extensive rivers and lowlands of Kalimantan clearly support wild populations. With the exception of Papua and West Papua Provinces, captive breeding and ranching (subject to approval and population monitoring) of <em>C. porosus </em>is permitted elsewhere in Indonesia (e.g. Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi). In July 2007, there were 15 registered farms in Indonesia (Manolis 2007, Manolis and McInnes 2007), but the number is now reduced. The last intensive review of crocodile conservation and management in Indonesia was in the early 1990s (Webb and Jenkins 1991), although some aspects of management were dealt with by a IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group (CSG) mission in 2014 (Brien <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Despite a self-imposed hunting moratorium between 1994 and 1996, it seems that by 1997 many crocodile farms in Papua Province had stockpiles of wild <em>C. porosus </em>skins collected during this time. Based on these stockpiles, the management plan was revised in 1997 to allow ranching (Directorate General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation 1997) (H. Kurniati, pers. comm. 2009). A system of ranching (juveniles) and wild harvest (sub-adults), similar to that established in neighbouring Papua New Guinea, is now well established in West Papua and Papua Provinces.<br/><br/>Annual export quotas are established by the Indonesian CITES Scientiﬁc Authority (LIPI - Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia) based on monitoring results, and the CITES Management Authority (PHKA) regulates the quotas. Spotlight surveys, which form the basis for monitoring the wild <em>C. porosus </em>population (Kurniati and Rumbarar 1999), were not undertaken between 1998 and 2008, and a zero export quota for the species was put in place. In 2007, it was reported that about 10,000 hatchlings were taken through ranching (H. Kurniati, pers. comm. 2009). Industry is also interested in an egg harvest, which was undertaken on a trial basis with the New Guinea Crocodile (<em>C. novaeguineae</em>) in the early 1990s under an FAO project (Manolis and McInnes 2007), but costs of collection in the remote swamps of West Papua and Papua Province have been prohibitive (H. Kurniati, pers. comm. 2009). Concerns have been raised that the harvest quotas in Papua Province could be increased and that the system of quota allocation between farms may not be equitable (Manolis and McInnes 2007). Although minimum and maximum size limits for wild <em>C. porosus </em>skins (25 cm and 51 cm belly width respectively) are established, large skins are still purchased illegally by buyers. It is difﬁcult for hunters to distinguish between the two species of crocodiles around the maximum size limit.<br/><br/>It is widely recognized that the crocodile industry in Indonesia (as in Papua New Guinea) is an important, and sometimes the only, source of cash income for many rural communities in remote areas. In 2015, 8133 skins were exported from Indonesia (Caldwell 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Malaysia</strong><br/>The Malaysian population of <em>C. porosus </em>was transferred to CITES Appendix II in 2016, mainly to allow the State of Sarawak to implement a wild harvest and ranching program to create incentives to address increasing levels of HCC (CITES 2016). A zero export quota for wild specimens of <em>C. porosus </em>currently applies to Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah.<br/><br/><em><strong>Peninsular Malaysia</strong></em>: Saltwater Crocodiles were considered relatively rare but are now sighted more regularly throughout Peninsular Malaysia (e.g. Klang River; Kwan 2017). Sebastian (1993) listed 10 localities where <em>C. porosus </em>had been reported and suggested that the Setui-Chalok-Bari basin on the east coast near Terengganu may contain the most signiﬁcant population, but this is yet to be conﬁrmed by surveys. A preliminary survey of <em>C. porosus </em>in Rembau Estuary in 2009 indicated a relative density of 2.9 non-hatchlings/km with the presence of hatchlings indicating successful nesting the previous season (Nazli and Hashim 2009). In July 2013, a large <em>C. porosus</em>, estimated to be around 6 m long, was found dead on the banks of the Kuala Selangor River at Bukit Belimbing, Kuala Selangor. A sack and plastic bag found in its stomach suggested that pollution may have been implicated in its death (Chen 2015).<br/><br/><em><strong>Sabah</strong></em>: Surveys of the <em>C. porosus </em>population have been undertaken irregularly over time in Sabah. Stuebing and Mohammed Sah (1992) surveyed the Klias River and found a small but viable population of around 50 individuals (hatchling-adult), while Cox and Gombek (1985) reported uniformly low densities throughout Sabah. Kaur (2006) reported that the relative density of <em>C. porosus </em>in the Segama River had increased from around 0.04 individuals/km in 1981 (Whitaker 1984) to 1.42 individuals/km in 2005. Stuebing (2002) reported a mean density of 1.1 non-hatchlings/km in Sabah rivers—22 times that reported by Whitaker in 1984 (0.05 non-hatchlings/km). A three-year state-wide survey program across 11 of Sabah’s largest rivers, selected on the basis of historical data and incidence of HCC, was completed in late 2019 to assess status and population trends. Preliminary results from six of those rivers indicated a mean relative density of 0.66 non-hatchlings/km; Luke Evans pers. comm. 2017). Notwithstanding that the preliminary mean density reported in 2019 is lower than that reported by Steubing <em>et al</em>. (2002), there is little doubt that the <em>C. porosus </em>population in Sabah has recovered signiﬁcantly over the last 20+ years. This is considered to be the result of a combination of legal protection (since 1982), a decline in the timber industry which decreased habitat/river disturbance, stabilization of oil palm estates and secondary growth along river banks, opening of closed canopy swamp and riverine forest, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation episode of 1997-98 which reduced ﬂooding of nests and led to high recruitment that year, and a dramatic decline in the harvest of wild crocodiles for skins during the late 1990s due to both lower prices and the implementation of CITES (Steubing <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>The increase in HCC in recent years (30 attacks in 2015–2019; CrocBite 2020) is of major concern to authorities (Webb 2008). Problem crocodiles have been captured and removed to farms (Look Fook Soon Trading, unpublished data), although some individuals are shot due to their proximity to human habitation. The current state-wide survey program will inform a new management plan to be drafted in 2020.<br/><br/><em><strong>Sarawak</strong></em>: Saltwater Crocodiles occur in most major rivers in Sarawak and large individuals are sufﬁciently common to be a serious threat to people. Surveys undertaken in the early 1980s found uniformly low densities of crocodiles throughout Sarawak (0.05 non-hatchlings/km; Cox and Gombek 1985) but recent surveys indicate that numbers have increased markedly since that time (CITES 2016). Surveys conducted in 2012–2014 indicated densities of 0.68 non-hatchlings/km (Sarawak Forestry Department) and 0.83 non-hatchlings/km (Sarawak Forestry Corporation), and the population was estimated to be around 12,000–13,500 individuals (CITES 2016). Sarawak is currently implementing the “Management Plan for Estuarine Crocodile (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>) in Sarawak 2016–2020” which includes removal of problem crocodiles, population surveys and monitoring, wild harvest and ranching, and community-based ecotourism and research.<br/><br/>The size structure of the population, with a high proportion of large individuals, is considered to have contributed to high rates of HCC. Attacks on humans in Sarawak have increased over time (1980–1999: 1.85/yr; 2000–2009: 4.3/yr; 2010–2017: 8.5/yr; CrocBite 2018; Lading 2004) leading authorities to undertaking culling operations in areas where fatal attacks have taken place. In May 1992, a notorious and distinctively marked (white back) C. porosus, Bujang Senang, was killed after 30 years in which it is reported to have eaten 13 people (Ritchie and Jong 1993).<br/><br/><strong>Myanmar</strong><br/>Once widely distributed throughout all coastal areas, <em>C. porosus </em>is now largely restricted to the lower Ayeyarwady (= Irrawaddy) River, and coastal Rakhine and Tanintharyi states. The only viable population is in Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary (MKWS) and adjacent forest reserves of the Ayeyarwady Delta, where nesting and recruitment were documented in 1999 (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2000; 2003; 2006). The sanctuary was resurveyed in January 2017 and the numbers were comparable to the 1999 survey (S. Platt <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). It is speculated that this population may function as a source population for coastal regions in southern Myanmar, including offshore islands in the Myeik Archipelago and one of the only significant populations of <em>C. porosus </em>remaining on mainland southeast Asia. Reports of crocodile attacks (CrocBite 2018) indicate that C. porosus is present in the Myeik Archipelago, albeit at low densities. MKWS could also be the source of crocodiles that recently turned up near Phuket Island, Thailand.<br/><br/>Platt <em>et al</em>. (2015) surveyed Lampi Marine National Park in the Tanintharyi region of Myanmar and found no evidence of an extant crocodile population, although it harboured a population of <em>C. porosus </em>as recently as the 1990s. Local extinction is attributed to direct persecution, egg harvesting (for domestic consumption and sale), and capture of crocodiles to sell to buyers from crocodile farms in Thailand. The park appears to be a potential site in which <em>C. porosus </em>could be reintroduced. It is also possible the island group could be recolonized by crocodiles dispersing from MKWS or elsewhere on the mainland.<br/><br/>A small population of approximately 20 <em>C. porosus </em>is known to occur in Ban Pone Chaung, a mangrove wetland on the mainland near Ywa Thit Village in the southern Tanintharyi region (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2014). A few crocodiles reportedly still occur in the Tanintharyi River, although these probably do not constitute a viable population (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2012). Other small populations of questionable viability are rumoured to be scattered along the coast from Ywa Thit northwards to Myeik but have not been formally confirmed (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Hatchlings from the MKWS were collected for captive rearing and 68 were released back to the wild when up to 1.2 m long between 1998 and 2001 (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). A farming-ranching program was implemented by the government in 1978 and the first farm (Thaketa Crocodile Farm) established in 1979 (Aung Moe 1994). Juvenile C. porosus collected from the wild (4097 between 1978 and 1999) and captive-bred individuals (3,087 hatchlings between 1983 and 1999) were used to stock the farm. Exports were mainly of live animals to Thailand and Singapore but since 1990 there has been limited production. The farm remains in operation but continues to be poorly managed (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2013) due to a range of technical problems (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). Efforts to register it as a CITES captive breeding facility in early 2008 were unsuccessful. In 2013, the farm maintained 500-600 crocodiles, ranging in size from hatchlings to large adults. Hatching success is poor and may be related to the nutritionally inadequate diet of marine fish and fish skins (obtained from a nearby fish processing facility) provided to adult breeders.<br/><br/>During the 1970s, the Government of Cambodia presented three <em>C. siamensis </em>to General Nwe Win, the former ruler of Myanmar. The <em>C. siamensis </em>can no longer be accounted for, and it is unknown if these hybridized with the more numerous <em>C. porosus </em>in the farm. Platt et al. (2013) recommended Thaketa Crocodile Farm concentrate solely on public education where it could make a significant contribution to regional crocodile conservation.<br/><br/><strong>Palau</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles were extensively hunted in Palau for their skins between the 1960s and 1980s. The ﬁrst systematic survey of crocodiles undertaken in 1991, by Messel and King (1992b), recorded 42 crocodiles in 112 km of waterways concentrated in two small populations at North Estuary on Belilou and Ngerdok Lake on Babeldaob. Brazaitis <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated the total population to be 500–750 individuals from a survey in 2003. The Bureau of Marine Resources has run a crocodile program since 2004 and conducted surveys between 2005 and 2008. The most recent surveys revealed relative densities of 0.41 to 1.48 individuals/km in coastal mangrove habitat, and 0.41 to 2.81 individuals/km in creeks with the majority of individuals estimated to be 0.6–3.0 m total length (J. Eberdong pers. comm 2008). The available survey results suggest that the population has not increased signiﬁcantly since the early 1990s but is probably stable. However, interviews with 46 past and present crocodile hunters in 2002/2003 suggested that there were more crocodiles than there had been historically (Matthews 2003, 2005).<br/><br/>There have been two crocodile attacks reported in Palau, the first in 1965 and the most recent in 2012 (CrocBite 2018). The Palau program focuses on ‘problem’ crocodile complaints and public awareness, with 21 problem crocodiles reported between 2005 and 2008, mostly from the north of the country (J. Eberdong, pers. comm. 2009). A few adult <em>C. porosus </em>were maintained in captivity in Koror, which have produced captive-bred hatchlings that have been released back into the wild. The success of reintroduction remains unknown.<br/><br/>Despite concerns about the genetic integrity of <em>C. porosus </em>in Palau due to past importation of different crocodile species (New Guinea Crocodile: <em>C. novaeguineae</em>; Philippines Crocodile: <em>C. mindorensis</em>, and American Alligator: <em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>; Brazaitis <em>et al</em>. 2009), an analysis of 39 blood samples from wild <em>C. porosus </em>conﬁrmed no hybridization (Russello <em>et al</em>. 2007). A CSG review in 2005 highlighted the fact that crocodiles are not currently protected by law, and that the public generally “dislike” them and consider them pests (Anon 2006). At times, crocodiles are killed and eaten as food but are not thought to be detrimental to their numbers.<br/><br/><strong>Papua New Guinea<br/></strong><em>Crocodylus porosus</em> is widely distributed throughout the lowlands of Papua New Guinea and on the islands of New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville and Manus. Current management of the wild population involves ranching (eggs, hatchlings, juveniles) and wild harvest (with size limits to protect breeding stock). A monitoring program has included regular nest surveys of representative habitats in the middle Sepik River since 1982 with a review of the program carried out in 1995 and subsequent revision of nesting indices (Manolis 1995). Nesting surveys indicate that the <em>C. porosus </em>population in the Sepik River is healthy and increasing at a rate of 2.4% p.a., with greater than 70 nests detected annually from 2003–2014 across 12 primary sites (Solmu <em>et al</em>. 2014). This increase has been attributed in part to a conservation awareness campaign and conservation incentives generated from an expanded <em>C. porosus</em> egg harvest (Wilken and Langelet 2004, Sine and Kula 2006, Solmu <em>et al</em>. 2014). The increasing involvement of local communities in the egg collection program has helped turn a HCC problem into an economic opportunity that supports the conservation of <em>C. porosus </em>(Solmu <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, increasingly strict skin grading standards in the international market have resulted in reduced purchases of ranched juveniles by farms leading to a reduction in price for wild skins, and thereby threatening the incentives that have been created in some remote areas through the program (E. Langelet, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Introduced ﬁsh (Pacu: <em>Piaractus brachypomus</em>, Java Barb (Java Carp): <em>Barbonymus gonionotus</em>) continue to degrade nesting habitats (Cox <em>et al</em>. 2006, G. Solmu, pers. comm. 2018) although other factors (e.g. climate change) may be implicated. Consideration is currently being given to size and quality of current remaining habitats, land tenure and land use, presence of other fauna and expansion (data collection) into new areas in which the Sepik Wetlands Management Initiative (formed in 1998) is working.<br/><br/>Given the very large area of inaccessible and undeveloped habitat, and the incentives for local traditional landowners to maintain crocodiles, <em>C. porosus </em>appears secure in Papua New Guinea. Reports from New Britain suggest that increasing numbers of attacks on people and livestock were due to increasing numbers of <em>C. porosus </em>(PNG National Newspaper, 28 August 2009). However, attack data reported by CrocBite (2017) for the country as a whole suggest that the frequency of attacks by <em>C. porosus </em>has remained somewhat stable over the last 15 years (5.6 per year; range 1 to 11).<br/><br/><strong>Philippines</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodile populations and habitats are reduced throughout the Philippines, and no large populations of <em>C. porosus </em>remain (Ortega <em>et al</em>. 1994). Today they exist as a few single individuals, small groups, and some iconic populations scattered through remaining wetland habitats. Areas with the highest numbers of <em>C. porosus </em>are thought to be on the island of Mindanao (e.g. Ligawasan Marsh), rivers and estuaries around southern Palawan, Sulu Archipelago in southwestern Philippines, northeastern Mindanao and some part of northeastern Luzon. A recent survey (Manalo <em>et al</em>. 2012) found evidence of basking areas that are potential nesting sites in the Agusan River basin, but no large viable population of <em>C. porosus </em>is known to exist. The connectivity of the islands of Palawan and Mindanao with the northeast coast of Borneo suggests a shared crocodile population.<br/><br/>The Balabac Group of Islands in southern Palawan had higher numbers of <em>C. porosus </em>compared to other areas in the Philippines. Recent population data derived from spotlight surveys at 17 locations reflects that the population in the southern portion of Palawan, at a density of 1.05 individuals/km, is higher than previously thought and the historical declines appear to be reversible. The populations of <em>C. porosus </em>in Sulu Archipelago, Zamboanga Peninsula and Siargao Island are still viable (R. Manalo, pers. comm. 2018), and locally protected. Surveys conducted in 2019 recorded the presence of <em>C. porosus </em>along the coast of southern Mindanao and in the coastal municipalities of Surigaodel sur Province, with high numbers in Tawi-tawi (1.78 individuals/km) in Sulu Archipelago. Although both <em>C. porosus </em>and <em>C. mindorensis </em>co-exist in Ligawasan Marsh, interviews with local residents in 2007 suggest that <em>C. mindorensis</em> is more commonly sighted than <em>C. porosus </em>(Pomares <em>et al</em>. 2009). To date, no surveys have been undertaken to quantify the abundance of either species in the area. The northern Sierra Madre National Park in Isabela also appears home to a small population of C. porosus (R. Manalo, pers. comm. 2018), which is threatened by killing as pests, by-catch in ﬁshing nets, and agricultural encroachment (Manalo 2004).<br/><br/>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the majority of the remaining wild adult <em>C. porosus </em>population on Palawan (141 individuals) and Mindanao (115 individuals) were caught or acquired from private collectors and relocated to the Crocodile Farming Institute, where they formed the nucleus of a captive breeding population. The progeny of these animals were later relocated to private establishments, some of which have begun commercial farming based on captive breeding (Mercado 2007). Captive-bred stock are thus available for reintroduction efforts in the future (Crocodylus Porosus Philippines Inc., pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Of 26 crocodile attacks in the Philippines in 2000–2015, 20 occurred in southern Palawan (Corvera <em>et al</em>. 2017) despite no evidence of an increasing crocodile population. Crocodiles that threaten the safety of people and livestock are usually killed, but in most cases crocodiles are afforded a level of protection by indigenous communities that still practice their cultural beliefs toward crocodiles and their habitats. In addition, continuous information and education campaigns throughout the species’ distribution are being conducted to strengthen human-crocodile coexistence (R. Manolo pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>In February 2007, a forum convened to address conservation, management and sustainable use of crocodiles in the Philippines (Anon 2007). This led to an exchange of information and experience between organizations in Luzon (Mabuwaya Foundation) and Mindanao (University of Southern Mindanao) (USM Crocodile Research Team 2007; Mabuwaya Foundation Inc. 2007), and closer collaboration with the crocodile farming industry (Crocodylus Porosus Philippines Inc.). In 2015, the Philippine Government reconstituted the Philippine Crocodile National Recovery Team (PCNRT), to be known as the National Committee for the Conservation of Crocodiles (NCCC). The NCCC developed the “Conservation and Management Plan for the Crocodile in the Philippines” that serves as a guiding framework for both species of crocodiles in the country. The key goals and strategies include the establishment of sanctuaries, enhancement of social understanding and acceptance, implementation of protocols in managing human-crocodile conflict, and effective monitoring and management of wild and captive populations (see Manalo and Mercado 2019). A second forum on crocodiles in the Philippines (theme: Strengthening Partnerships in Conservation Research and Sustainable Management of Crocodiles) was convened in March 2019 (Manalo and Mercado 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Seychelles</strong><br/>Crocodiles were noted when the first Europeans visited the Seychelles in 1609. Re-examination of skeletal material suggests that the species that occurred there at the time of European discovery was <em>C. porosus</em>, and not <em>C. niloticus </em>as previously assumed (Gerlach and Canning 1993). Europeans had extirpated the population by the early 1800s.<br/><br/><strong>Singapore</strong><br/>Considered to have been extinct in Singapore, Saltwater Crocodiles have been present and breeding in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (SBWR), on the northwest coast of Singapore, since around 2004 (H.C. Beng, pers. comm. 2017). The reserve is around 130 ha in size and was listed as an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2003. Given the high rate of local and international visitation to SBWR, the potential for HCC is of concern to authorities so barriers have been constructed along some walkways that are close to where crocodiles regularly bask to mitigate the HCC risk (H.C. Beng, pers. comm. 2017). CrocBite reports 26 attacks between 1842–1957 with the two most recent attacks in 1974 and 1989. Individual <em>C. porosus </em>have been reported in other parts of Singapore. The population was previously estimated to comprise around 15 adults but this number can vary from year to year, and in 2017 only 5–6 adult <em>C. porosus </em>were regularly sighted (H.C. Beng, pers. comm. 2017). The source of the <em>C. porosus </em>population in Singapore is considered to be Peninsular Malaysia, which is around 1 km from Singapore. One crocodile tagged with a location device by Singaporean authorities regularly travelled every few days between the two countries.<br/><br/><strong>Solomon Islands</strong><br/>The only vessel-based survey of crocodiles in the Solomon Islands was undertaken in 1989 by Messel and King (1990) who identiﬁed survey sites based on knowledge from local people and crocodile hunters. Suitable habitat is restricted by the terrain and further reduced by human occupation and agriculture. Most sightings were from three localities - Lauvi Lagoon (Guadacanal), Lake Tatae (Russell Islands) and Ghahirahobo (Santa Isabel). With the cessation of hunting for skins in 1989, the <em>C. porosus </em>population has increased, resulting in increased HCC and fatalities in different parts of the country. The situation has been exacerbated by the banning of firearms following civil unrest and the arrival of the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission (RAMSI) in 2003, such that local people were unable to deal with problem crocodiles themselves.<br/><br/>In 2018 (April–August), WorldFish in partnership with the Solomon Islands Government, conducted a nationwide survey of community knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward crocodiles (Van der Ploeg et al. 2019). The purpose was to obtain reliable information on the population status of saltwater crocodiles and the extent of HCC in the country. This would in turn be used to develop a management plan as identified in the Solomon Islands National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan 2016–2020. A total of 822 people (472 men and 350 women) were interviewed in 234 villages in seven provinces across the Solomon Islands. The knowledge of local people on the number of crocodiles in particular areas proved to be a robust way of estimating abundance. A total of 225 crocodile attacks on people were reported since 1998, 83 of which were fatal (37%) including 31 children. Over the past 10 years, on average, five people per year have been killed by saltwater crocodiles. Since the cessation of commercial hunting in 1993, the saltwater crocodile population has recovered rapidly. It is estimated that there are now between 1,400 and 2,300 non-hatchling Saltwater Crocodiles in the country, with breeding reported on every major island (Van der Ploeg <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>With more and larger saltwater crocodiles present, the number of attacks on people has and will continue to increase. Throughout the archipelago, communities are taking preventive measures to minimize the risks of crocodile attacks, with people emphasizing the need to supervise children, avoid fishing alone, and be alert at night and during floods. Flashlights are considered an effective tool to prevent a crocodile attack, and in many villages, crocodiles are killed by local hunters with traps and spears as a precautionary measure or in retaliation of an attack. Cultural restrictions on killing and eating crocodiles remain pervasive throughout the country. Crocodiles are widely regarded as taboo (sacred) animals that need to be treated with respect, with attacks often attributed to the wrath of ancestors or to sorcery (Van der Ploeg <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Sri Lanka<br/></strong>The status of <em>C. porosus</em> in Sri Lanka varies between locations, although how current abundance in different areas compares to historical abundance is unknown. The <em>C. porosus</em> population in Sri Lanka was estimated to be around 375 non-hatchlings in 1978, with the majority (70%) conﬁned to the southwest coast of the island (Whitaker and Whitaker 1979). More recently, Amarasinghe et al. (2015) conservatively estimated the <em>C. porosus </em>population to be around 2000 non-hatchlings, although field surveys are yet to support these numbers. An island-wide survey for crocodylians is underway and may shed light on more accurate and current population sizes in near future. A breeding population is known to exist in Muthurajawela Swamp (Devapriya 2004, Jayawardene 2004), although sporadic breeding is occasionally reported at other locations (e.g. De Silva and de Silva 2008, Gramentz 2008). Surveys in 2007-2008 in the Bentota River revealed a small breeding population, with the size structure strongly biased towards hatchlings (35 cm TL) and yearlings (&lt;70 cm TL: 93%; Gramentz 2008) which is indicative of a depleted population attempting to recover. Devapriya (2004) observed 20 individuals along a 2.8-km stretch of the Dandugam Oya, with 2-9 individuals in 1.7 km of adjacent marsh. <em>Crocodylus porosus </em>were also reported in the Madu Ganga (De Silva and De Silva 2008). De Silva (2008) reported an estimated population of 50 individuals in a 5 km stretch of the Nilwala River. Samarasinghe and Chandrasiri, (2013) reported a relative density of 5.1 individuals/km in Bellanwila-Attidiya Sanctuary in 2013. Hatchlings and juveniles have also been observed in Bolgoda Lake, Polwatte River, Matara River, Nilwala River, Walawe River, Hada Oya and Batticaloa lagoon (Samaringhe pers. comm 2020).<br/><br/>Major threats to the species include the destruction of eggs, killing, ﬁshing and habitat loss (eg urban encroachment, sand mining, conversion for tourism and agriculture) and pollution (De Silva 2008, Samarasinghe and Chandrasiri 2013, Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. 2015). Killing of crocodiles is sometimes “revenge” after attacks on humans but in some cases crocodiles are taken by villagers/fishermen as a source of meat (Madawala <em>et al</em>. 2013, Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. 2015). Local communities along the rivers use a variety of crocodile exclusion enclosures for bathing, washing, etc., in response to attacks by <em>C. porosus </em>(De Silva 2008). The current practice of relocating “problem” <em>C. porosus</em>, sometimes into Mugger (<em>C. palustris</em>) habitats, is not considered to be a good long-term strategy that is further exacerbated by authorities lacking expertise with regard to the capture and transport of crocodiles (Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Despite these anthropogenic impacts, the <em>C. porosus </em>population is considered to have increased significantly in Sri Lanka since the late 1970s (De Silva 2013). The total population was estimated to be around 375 non-hatchlings in 1978, with the majority (70%) conﬁned to the southwest coast of the island (Whitaker and Whitaker 1979). More recently, Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. (2015) conservatively estimated the <em>C. porosus </em>population to be around 2000 non-hatchlings. <br/><br/><strong>Thailand</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles are effectively extinct in Thailand. Surveys in the early 1990s revealed sightings of one or two <em>C. porosus </em>on Phuket Island (Ratanakorn <em>et al</em>. 1994) but the majority of suitable habitat in this area has now been destroyed or occupied by people. Occasional reports of crocodiles such as by local ﬁsherman in the Ranong River, adjacent to the Myanmar border, and a report of a newly-hatched clutch in 2010 (TCMA 2013) suggest a few individuals may still exist. Temsiripong (2012) reported a small remnant population at Samaesarn Island on the southeast coast and two female <em>C. porosus </em>(2.43 and 2.5 m TL) were captured, marked and released in April 2012. Ao Bandon, the largest mangrove inlet on the east coast, may still support a number of <em>C. porosus </em>(Ngampongsai and Nabhitabhata 1987) but this remains to be confirmed. TCMA (2013) estimated the wild population of <em>C. porosus</em> to comprise around 200 individuals.<br/><br/>As of 31 December 2016, some 156,000 <em>C. porosus </em>were held in crocodile farms in the country (Manolis 2017), of which 16 were registered as CITES captive breeding operations at the end of 2017. Farms contain mainly <em>C. siamensis</em>, but hybridization between <em>C. siamensis </em>and <em>C. porosus </em>is well established.<br/><br/><strong>Timor Leste</strong><br/>The population status of <em>C. porosus</em> in Timor Leste is unknown but it is considered to have increased significantly since the country achieved independence in 2002. The largest population exists in Lake Iralalaro (Nino Konis Santana National Park, Posto administrative Lautém). In addition, various waterbodies, mainly lagoons and billabongs along the coast, contain crocodiles including Be Malae (Bobonaro), Ai Parapa, Hera, Christo Rei (all Dili), Naktuka and Citrana (all Oecusse), Loes (Liquica), River Irabere and Maurei, Waibani Waiwai, Rubinaha Wai, Matahoi, Luca (all Viqueque), Namalutu, Urunami and Lapalapa, Werukoco, Raumoco (all Lautém), Kasalac, Hasan Foun, Onu Bot, Beco, Raimea no Leolima, Tashilin and Raimea (all Cova Lima), Modomahut (Manufahi), Seical, Vemase (all Baucau), Ribeira Manatuto (Manatuto) and Bican Tidin (Ainaro) (Crocodile Task Force Timor-Leste 2017). <br/><br/>From 2007 to 2019, there have been 59 fatalities and 21 non-fatal attacks on people (CrocBITE 2019) but many are believed to go unreported. In response, the Timorese Government has set up warning signs at known crocodile spots and is regularly visiting affected communities to raise public awareness. Culturally, crocodiles are very important to local people and <em>C. porosus</em> is the national animal (Anon 2008b). There is some hunting of crocodiles for meat by coastal communities and some C. porosus are held in captivity in the capital, Dili. The Government has constructed a crocodile enclosure in Hera, near Dili, to enable the removal of problem crocodiles. Community-based monitoring was conducted in various communities in Lautém and Viqueque to assess data on crocodile habitat and attacks, integrating the knowledge of local stakeholders. Local authorities raised the concern that crocodiles dispersing from Australia could be responsible for the increase in crocodile attacks. Future research and management should focus on testing the dispersal hypothesis, and on the removal of problem crocodiles from areas where crocodile habitat and human activity frequently overlaps, as well as on developing an ecotourism strategy including “crocodile watching”.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Viet Nam</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles persisted in southern Viet Nam and the Mekong delta until 20-25 years ago, but extensive habitat degradation and the direct capture and killing of crocodiles greatly reduced the wild population. By the mid-1940s no more than 100 <em>C. porosus </em>were thought to survive in the wild (Cuc 1994). No viable wild populations are known to exist today. A re-introduction and recovery program for <em>C. porosus </em>in remaining suitable habitat was proposed by a CSG review mission (Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2008) but no progress has been made to date. Very few <em>C. porosus </em>are on crocodile farms (Jenkins and Sung 1998, Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2008, H. Jenkins, pers. comm. 2018). Nonetheless, hybridization of <em>C. porosus </em>with either <em>C. siamensis </em>or <em>C. rhombifer </em>(imported into Viet Nam from Cuba in 1985) is a possibility (Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Vanuatu</strong><br/>The eastern-most population of <em>C. porosus </em>is recorded from eastern Vanua Lava in Vanuatu (New Hebrides and Banks Islands). The area was surveyed in 1992 by Messel and King (1992a), who concluded that crocodiles were on the verge of extinction there. Only two adult crocodiles were seen in the wild and the population was no longer breeding. In 2003, Australia Zoo was asked by the Vanuatu Government to capture and relocate a 3.6 m <em>C. porosus </em>from the heavily populated island of Maewo to Vanua Lava where it is believed to have originated. The population comprises perhaps 15–20 individuals that had recovered from a much smaller population after Tropical Cyclone Wendy in late 1972 (F. Hickey, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Other </strong><br/>Stray <em>C. porosus</em> have been encountered considerable distances from their normal range. For example:<br/><ul><li>In 1971, a 3.8 m <em>C. porosus </em>was captured in southern Pohnpei, Eastern Caroline Islands, around 1,360 km from the nearest population (Allen 1974, Buden and Haglelgam 2010).</li><li>Around 1959, a 1.0–1.5 m long crocodile, assumed to be <em>C. porosus</em>, was killed at Eauripik Island, Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia. Although not reported in the literature, many residents sighted the animal after it was killed (Buden and Haglelgam 2010). In late 1986, another crocodile, also assumed to be <em>C. porosus</em>, was reported from Woleai Atoll, Yap State (Eldredge 1994, Buden and Haglelgam 2010).</li><li>Takashima (1955) reported three crocodiles from Japanese territories; one from Iwo Jima (in 1744), one from Amami- Oshima at the northern end of the Ryukyu Islands (in 1800), and a third from Toyama Bay, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. All three were presumed to be <em>C. porosus</em>.</li><li>A vagrant crocodile was reported on Nauru Island, 1,160 km from the nearest <em>C. porosus </em>population (Webb 1994).</li><li>In October 2004, an individual <em>C. porosus </em>was captured in the Marshall Islands, some 2,000 km from the nearest <em>C. porosus </em>population in Papua New Guinea (Manolis 2005).</li></ul>The first reported <em>C. porosus</em> captured in the Maldives was in 1998, and the animal was placed in a local zoo (Ali 2015). In 2007, a crocodile, assumed to be <em>C. porosus</em>, was captured, and in April 2009 suspected crocodile tracks were investigated at Gaafu Alifu Atoll (Anon 2009). In January-February 2015 more than 10 saltwater crocodiles were reportedly sighted (Ali 2015), and a 3.1 m individual was captured near L. Isdhoo (Fayaz 2015). The closest population of <em>C. porosus </em>is in India, some 430 km away (Bindloss 2015).",Stable,"<p></p>The Saltwater Crocodile (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>) currently occurs in: Australia; Bangladesh; Brunei Darussalam; India; Indonesia; Malaysia; Myanmar; Palau; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Singapore; Solomon Islands; Sri Lanka; Timor Leste; and, Vanuatu. The species previously existed in Cambodia (possibly extinct); Seychelles (Extinct); Thailand (possibly extinct); and Viet Nam (possibly extinct). <br/><p></p>","<p></p>Saltwater Crocodile populations are legally protected in most range states, but protection alone may be ineffective. Management programs based on sustainable use (ranching, wild harvest, captive breeding) have been successfully implemented in Papua New Guinea, Australia and Indonesia, the three countries that contain the majority of the global population of the species. The possibility of establishing sustainable use programs in Malaysia and the Solomon Islands are being explored.<br/><br/>Farming of <em>C. porosus</em>, based on captive breeding, is undertaken in Bangladesh, China, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Stock produced through captive breeding is supplemented significantly through ranching programs (eggs, hatchlings and/or juveniles) in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Ranching is not possible in much of the former range of <em>C. porosus </em>because wild populations are severely depleted or extinct. In 2015, there was approximately 71,000 <em>C. porosus </em>skins traded internationally (Caldwell 2017).<br/><p></p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><strong>The IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group (CSG) Action Plan (Webb <em>et al</em>. 2019), has proposed the following conservation actions for <em>C. porosus </em>as high priorities.<br/></strong><br/>1. <strong>Status surveys:</strong> Current quantitative and qualitative assessments of the current status of wild <em>C. porosus </em>populations in the majority of range states are lacking. In particular, priorities should be (in alphabetical order) Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Palau, Timor Leste, Indonesia (outside Papua Province) and Viet Nam.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Management Programs:</strong> Once populations have been assessed, management plans are required, dependent upon survey findings, and designed specifically for the (sub) region. For some populations, the conservation problem appears to have been largely solved (depleted populations are now increasing) but as a consequence HCC may also be increasing. If realistic management programs, tailored to local circumstances, are not developed and implemented, there will be no public or political tolerance for the expanded population. While removal of problem crocodiles combined with public education have been successful historically, research into alternative strategies and innovations is now required to reduce the threat to humans.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Sustainable use programs:</strong> These programs have, in the past, proved to be a conservation success in recovering the Australia and Papua New Guinea <em>C. porosus </em>populations. However, probability of success depends on many factors including international skin market price fluctuations and the capacity of government regulation. An example where ranching may be of benefit is in Sarawak and Sabah (Malaysia) where farming operations are already established, so ranching would provide an avenue for indigenous investment. However, before this can be considered, surveys need to inform the degree to which any harvest could be sustainable.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Review of crocodile management in Indonesia: </strong>Population monitoring of <em>C. porosus </em>in Papua and West Papua Provinces has not been undertaken since 1998 (Kurniati and Rambarar 1999). Although wild harvest quotas have been reduced because of no survey data, the allocation of the quota among licensed farms is of concern to some operators (see Manolis and McInnes 2007). The regulatory system may beneﬁt from external review by the CSG or other competent groups. Protection is nominally afforded to <em>C. porosus </em>in areas other than Papua Province (CITES 1994) but it seems ranching is occurring in Sumatra, Kalimantan and perhaps other locations. If so, it needs to be sanctioned by CITES, through a proposal to the CITES Secretariat.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Increased regional cooperation in Southeast Asia: </strong>The close association between production and trade in crocodilian products (including <em>C. porosus </em>but mainly <em>C. siamensis</em>) between Cambodia, Viet Nam, Thailand and China indicates that management, conservation and regulatory activities need to be coordinated in this sub-region (see Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2005; 2008). Technical exchange (e.g. training), surveys, development of management programs and mutually supporting regulatory structures (e.g. enforcement, Customs) are recommended.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Crocodile conservation program in India:</strong> An evaluation of restocking and the identiﬁcation of additional release sites are in need of review. There is an excess of animals now in captivity and insufﬁcient release sites for them. The issue of HCC in Bhitarkanika National Park and adjacent areas needs to be assessed in view of the increasing attacks on local people.<br/><p></p>",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
3048087,5671,Crocodylus siamensis,Critically Endangered,A2cd,2012,2012-02-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> is among the most threatened crocodilians. In 1992 it was reported as virtually extinct in the wild (Thorbjarnarson 1992) and in 1996 was accorded the IUCN Red List status of ‘Critically Endangered' (Baillie and Groombridge 1996). This status remains unchanged. Field surveys, nearly all conducted since 2000, have confirmed that extant populations persist, but that all are severely diminished and fragmented. Over the past decade new information on the ecology of the species has been documented, although <em>C. siamensis</em> remains one of the least known crocodilians. Commercial hunting for the skin trade and collection of live animals to stock crocodile farms, in the mid- and late-twentieth century respectively, are considered to be the principal causes for its decline. Current threats include illegal collection of eggs, juveniles and adults, habitat loss, incidental capture with fishing gear, and the inherent vulnerability of remnant populations due to their small size.</p>  This species qualifies as Critically Endangered. Global populations have been severely reduced, almost certainly by over 80% in the past 75 years / three generations (assuming a generation time of 25 years), principally due to hunting. All remnant subpopulations are small and fragmented. Most current threats, including illegal collection and habitat loss or degradation, are ongoing, suggesting that without conservation interventions, extant populations will continue to decline.","<em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> occurs in a wide range of lowland freshwater habitats, including slow-moving rivers and streams, lakes, seasonal oxbow lakes, marshes and swamps (Smith 1931; Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003; Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2006; Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). During the wet season, individuals disperse across ﬂooded landscapes (one radio-tracked individual in Cambodia moved up to 25 km before returning to a dry season site; Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006b). The species has been recorded up to 600 m elevation (Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><p> <br/> <em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> is a medium-sized species, with most individuals attaining a total length of less than 3.5 m (Smith 1919). Nesting ecology is poorly documented and fewer than a few dozen wild nests have been located to date. Wild nests recorded in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Thailand were mounds located on floating vegetation mats or on the banks of lakes or rivers (Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Starr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Nesting occurs in the late dry season and and wet season. Clutch size observed in wild nests ranged from 11-26 eggs (Simpson and Han 2004, Starr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Captive <em>C. siamensis</em> produce clutches of 6-50 eggs (Youngprapakorn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1971, Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). Hatchlings emerge in the wet season after 70-80 days incubation (Brazaitis and Watanbe 1983, Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011, Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Fidelity to nesting sites has been recorded (Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a).<br/> <br/> Similar to many other crocodilians, <em>C. siamensis</em> feeds on a wide variety of prey such as invertebrates, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals, including carrion (Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Bezuijen 2010). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Other scientific studies of <em>C. siamensis </em>have included information on phylogeography and population genetics (Gratten 2003), seasonal sperm cycles (Kitiyanant <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994) and the antimicrobial properties of its blood (Merchant <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Hybridization of captive <em>C. siamensis</em> with <em>C. rhombifer</em> and<em>&#160;C. porosus</em> occurs (Chavananikul <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Thang 1994), and the chromosome number of <em>C. siamensis</em> and hybrids, as well as DNA methods to distinguish them, has been identiﬁed (Youngprapakorn 1991, Fitzsimmons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Srikulnath <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012).</p>  ..","<p>Commercial hunting in the mid-twentieth century for the skin trade is considered to be the principal cause for the historical decline of <em>C. siamensis</em>. Current and ongoing threats in virtually all range states include the illegal collection of eggs and crocodiles, habitat loss and degradation, and incidental capture/drowning in ﬁshing gear. In Cambodia, most river systems with extant <em>C. siamensis </em>are targeted for large-scale hydroelectric dams. Construction of some of these dams has already begun and has resulted in the loss of breeding habitat and increased collection and killing of crocodiles (J.C. Daltry unpubl. data). Illegal capture of wild crocodiles to supply local crocodile farms continues in Cambodia. In Viet Nam, over 19 crocodiles were apparently poached at Cat Tien National Park between 2001 and 2012, mainly for local consumption (Murphy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Pahl 2012). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Potential threats in some or all range states include climate change, the potential hybridization of wild populations due to inter-breeding with escaped hybrids, and the risk of genetic depression due to severely low numbers (Jelden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, 2008; Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Viet Nam appears to be the first range state where wild <em>C. siamensis</em> has been extirpated; in 2006, the last known site to support wild <em>C. siamensis </em>(Ha Lam Lake in Phu Yen Province; Nguyen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005) was flooded for construction of a hydroelectric dam. At Mesangat Lake in Indonesia, key threats to <em>C. siamensis </em>are the incidental capture of crocodiles in fishing gear and disturbance due to electro-fishing activities (N. Behler unpubl. data).</p>","<p>No global population estimate is available for <em>C. siamensis</em> and national population estimates are available for only one range state, Cambodia. Between 100 and 300 wild adults may remain in Cambodia, based on footprints and other evidence (Simpson and Han 2006a, Simpson and Bezuijen 2010 and references therein). Lao PDR may support a similar number of adults (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). The largest known population at any single site is 55-60 individuals, in Cambodia (Starr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010), but in both nations most known sites support only one or several individuals. In Thailand, one to several individuals persist in a small number of scattered localities, and nests are sometimes documented (Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, J. Thorbjarnarson in litt. cited in Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). In Viet Nam, the species may have been extirpated from the wild but a reintroduced population based on 60 individuals released between 2001-2004&#160; at Cat  Tien National   Park had an estimated population of 100-150 individuals in 2010-2011. A maximum of 80 non-hatchlings was observed and 10-15 adults estimated&#160; (Pahl 2012). At Mesangat Lake in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, mark-recapture surveys in 2010-2011 indicated that fewer than 30 individuals may be present, although nearby areas remain unsurveyed (N. Behler unpubl. data).</p>    <p>Wild nests and successful recruitment (i.e. presence of hatchlings) have been documented in all range states, but in low numbers. In Cambodia, nesting has been recorded at 10 localities in eight provinces since 2001, but the number of nest sites is declining and only one to three nests are documented annually (Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a). Veal Veng Marsh and the Areng River, both in the Cardamom Mountains, hold the largest wild populations, and each produces one to three nests annually (J.C. Daltry unpubl. data). In Lao PDR, nesting has been documented at eight localities but successful recruitment was confirmed at only five sites (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Of four clutches examined in Lao PDR, three were infertile (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press), indicating low female fertility and/or the absence of males. In Thailand, fewer than five wild nests and few hatchlings have been recorded over the past five years, suggesting low clutch fertility (J. Thorbjarnarson in litt. cited by Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press; Y. Temsiripong unpubl. data). In Viet Nam, hatchlings observed at Cat  Tien National   Park in 2010-2011 confirm that breeding persists there (Pahl 2012). At Lake  Mesangat in Indonesia, juvenile crocodiles have been observed and one nest has been located (N. Behler unpubl. data).</p>  <p>On the basis of these limited data, the global wild population of <em>C. siamensis</em> may comprise fewer than 1,000 mature individuals.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> historically occurred over much of mainland Southeast Asia as well as parts of Indonesia. Its current distribution is greatly diminished and fragmented. Extant populations are in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam, wild populations are possibly extirpated, the first range nation where this has occurred, although a reintroduction programme has been implemented in one site (see below). Most locations occur between 50 and 200 m elevation but localities in Cambodia&#160; at Veal Ven Marsh (560 m; Daltry <em>et al</em>. 2003) and the upper Tatai River (730 m; B. Simpson pers. comm.) are higher. Summaries of national distribution are as follows.<br/> <br/> Cambodia: Field surveys conducted since 2000; confirmed <em>C. siamensis </em>localities are from 35 sites in 21 river systems of 11 provinces, mainly in remote parts of southwest and northeast Cambodia (Daltry and Chheang 2000; Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003; Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, 2006; Simpson and Han 2004; Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a; Timmins 2007; Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). The largest remnant populations are in the Srepok, Sekong, Sre Ambel/Kampong Saom, Pursat, Koi, Kep, Tatai and Areng  Rivers and Veal Veng Marsh.<br/> <br/> Indonesia: Mesangat Lake in the Mahakam River system, East Kalimantan Province (Borneo), supports the only known extant population outside mainland Southeast Asia (Cox <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1993, Cox 2004, Ross <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998; Kurniati <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). Research in 2010-2011 by N. Behler confirmed the persistence of this population. Unconﬁrmed local reports of <em>C. siamensis</em> are from Central Kalimantan  Province (Ross <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). Museum specimens indicate the species historically occurred in Java (Ross 1990, 1992) but given the severe loss of wetland habitats there, it is unlikely any populations remain.<br/> <br/> </p>  <p>Lao PDR: Field surveys conducted between 2003 and 2008; confirmed <em>C. siamensis </em>localities are from nine river systems in five provinces, but extant populations are known from only seven river systems in four provinces (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Surveys confirmed previous reports (Salter 1993, Sawathvong 1994) that many local populations are now extirpated. Extant populations are in the Xe Champhone, Xe Banghiang, Xe Bangfai and Xe Xangxoy river systems (Savannakhet Province), Xe Pian-Xe Khampho river systems (Attapu Province), Xe Don River (Salavan Province) and Phou Khaokhouay National Protected Area (Bolikhamxay Province) (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Most wetlands in Lao PDR remain unsurveyed for crocodiles and it seems likely that other <em>C. siamensis </em>localities will be documented.<br/> <br/> </p>  <p>Malaysia: A single reference to a ‘fresh-water crocodile’ in northern Peninsular Malaysia (Robinson and Annandale 1904 cited by Smith 1919) was considered by Smith (1919) to be ‘probably referable to this species’. There are no known records from Sarawak or Sabah (Sebastian 1993). There is no other information to suggest that <em>C. siamensis </em>occurred in Malaysia.<br/> <br/> Myanmar: One record of crocodiles and eggs, from the Mekong River (Garnier 1885 - see Garnier 1996); no other known records, although most wetlands in Myanmar remain unsurveyed for crocodiles (Thorbjarnarson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). The section of the Mekong in Myanmar (~200 km long) is currently under restricted access and off-limits to international surveys. Google satellite imagery indicates that much of it retains riverine forest and low human densities: it is possible that some crocodiles may persist (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press).<br/> <br/> Thailand: Historically common and widely distributed (Smith 1919, Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002); extant populations are in a small number of scattered localities in central and western Thailand (Kreetiyutanont 1993, Ratanakorn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Temsiripong 2003). Confirmed sites include Pang Sida and Kaengkrachan National Parks (Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Temsiripong 2003).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Viet Nam: Historically present in southern Viet Nam (Cuc 1994, Cao and Jenkins 1998); wild populations possibly extirpated. Surveys over the past two decades have failed to detect crocodiles in sites they were reported to occur (Platt and Tri 2000, Stuart <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002) except one site, Ha Lam Lake (Phu Yen Province), where at least two individuals were present in 2005 (Nguyen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). A single reintroduced population is at Cat  Tien National   Park (Polet 2006, Murphy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004), where breeding occurs (J. Thorbjarnarson in litt. July 2009, Pahl 2012).</p>","<p><em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> is listed under Appendix I of CITES<em>.</em><em> </em>The species is<em> </em>well represented in captivity, with possibly one million individuals in farms in Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam (Temsiripong <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004; Jelden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, 2008), and smaller numbers in farms in China and zoos in Europe and North America. In Thailand, 799 farms were operating in 2010 (Getpech 2011).&#160; Getpech  (2011) reports&#160; 552,000 captive specimens&#160; in 2010 for Thailand,  Sovannara (2011) reports 257,000 in Cambodia, and Truyen (2011) reports  584,000 in Viet Nam. Caldwell (2010) reports 63,500 skins in  international trade in 2008. The UNEP-WCMC trade database indicates much  higher levels of international trade in more recent years (e.g. in live animals and skins). In 2010,  Thailand alone reported exports of 106,039 “heads” (see Getpech 2011).   However, the captive population in Indochina includes an unknown number of individuals hybridized with <em>C. porosus</em> and <em>C. rhombifer</em>, including back-crosses (Chavananikul <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Thang 1994, FitzSimmons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Jelden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). In Cambodia, more than 900 local crocodile farms or raising facilities with <em>C. siamensis</em> are present, mostly at the Tonle Sap Great Lake (Jelden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, Sovannara 2011). Testing has revealed that many <em>C. siamensis</em> on farms in Cambodia are hybrids, and animals from Cambodia have in turn been used to stock farms in neighbouring countries (J.C. Daltry unpubl. data). In southern Viet Nam, over 1,000 crocodile farms and raising facilities with almost exclusively <em>C. siamensis</em> are present (Jelden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Truyen 2011). In Lao PDR, the only known captive population is at Ban Kuen Zoo, which contains around 1,000 individuals, most of which are suspected to be hybrids (Phothitay <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, Cox and Phothitay 2008).&#160;  <strong></strong>  </p>  <p>&#160;Opportunistic collection of eggs or crocodiles continues in Cambodia, either for local use or sale to crocodile farms (Simpson <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Lao PDR, infrequent and low-level trade of captive crocodiles or products has been recorded, although surveys between 2003 and 2008 did not detect any evidence of trade (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). At Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam, crocodiles are hunted for local consumption (see Threats) but apparently not for trade (Pahl 2012). No hunting or trade of <em>C. siamensis</em> has been observed at Lake  Mesangat in Indonesia, although it is possible that local residents sometimes collect eggs (N. Behler unpubl. data).</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Most conservation efforts for <em>C. siamensis</em> were initiated in the past decade and are relatively recent. More conservation work for the species has been conducted in Cambodia than any other range state, including extensive status surveys and a long-term programme by the Government of Cambodia’s Forestry Administration and Fauna &amp; Flora International. This programme has achieved the monitoring and protection of breeding sites, training of ranger patrols, and community-based conservation initiatives (Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Simpson and Ratanapich 2007, Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a). Veal Veng Marsh, the Areng River, and the Sre Ambel/ Kampong Saom River are the focus of enforcement patrols and community-based conservation management, which have demonstrated success in&#160;reducing poaching since 2001 (Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Simpson and Ratanapich 2007, Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Oum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Additional community sanctuaries are planned in northeast Cambodia and a national re-introduction program will be launched in 2012 (Daltry and Starr 2010, Siamese Crocodile Task Force in prep.).</p>    <p>Elsewhere, status surveys were conducted in Lao PDR between 2003 and 2008, conservation priorities were identified (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press) and a management plan to protect breeding sites was prepared for one province (Cox and Somvongsa 2008). Community workshops were held in 2006 and 2007 to document local knowledge of crocodiles (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Mollot <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Most <em>C. siamensis </em>localities in Lao PDR are outside the national protected area system and conservation will rely on community-based approaches. In Thailand, a re-introduction programme was initiated by the Royal Thai Forest Service and Crocodile Management Association of Thailand, with 20 crocodiles released in Pang Sida National Park in 2005 and 2006 (Temsiripong 2001, 2007). Few crocodiles were detected during subsequent monitoring (Temsiripong 2007) and further releases are being considered. Severe flooding in Thailand in 2011 hindered the implementation of some re-introduction plans (Y. Temsiripong pers. obs.). In Viet Nam, 60 captive individuals were released in Cat Tien National Park between 2001 and 2004 (Polet 2006) and the population has been irregularly monitored since then. The most recent surveys (2010-2011) confirmed that the population has increased in size, but that crocodiles continue to be hunted by local residents (Pahl 2012). In Indonesia, Mesangat Lake is owned by an oil palm company, and in 2010 the company entered into a partnership with a local foundation, Yayasan Ulin, to jointly manage habitats at the lake (R. Stuebing in litt.).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The large captive populations of <em>C. siamensis </em>held on farms (see Use and Trade) represent a potential source for re-introduction programs, and farms in Thailand and Viet Nam have donated <em>C. siamensis</em> for this purpose.

It is suspected that the species has suffered an overall population decline of 50–80% over the past three generations due to widespread intensive exploitation, that has not ceased. It is therefore listed as Endangered.<br/></p>","<p><em>Cuora amboinensis</em>&#160;is largely restricted to standing water bodies, but opportunistically inhabits most types of water bodies except large rivers and reservoirs. It prefers lowland swampy areas with dense vegetation, but also occurs in intermittent streams in hill forest areas, mangrove creeks, rice paddies and irrigation canals, from tidal areas up to about 400 m altitude (Das 1991, van Dijk 1998, Schoppe and Das 2011).<br/><br/>This species feeds on a wide variety of plant and animal matter; aquatic and terrestrial plants, fruits, molluscs, crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and mushrooms have all been reported in the diet (Schoppe and Das 2011).<br/><br/>Animals may reach nearly 25 cm (Lim and Das 1999), but usually remain smaller (Schoppe and Das 2011). Maturity has been reported at 13 cm carapace length for males and 15 cm carapace length for females, at six years. Schoppe (pers. obs.) presumes that it takes approx. 4.5–5 years to attain maturity in captivity and at least one more year to reach that stage in the wild (Schoppe and Das 2011). Females usually produce 1 or 2 clutches of 1–5 eggs per year. (review in Das 1991). A mean of three clutches with two eggs each resulting in a total of six eggs per female per year are laid in captivity by the Palawan subpopulation (Schoppe 2008, 2009).<br/><br/>The mean size of the individuals is reduced as a result of over-exploitation in Indonesia and Malaysia (Schoppe 2008, 2009).<br/><br/>Generation length is estimated at 18 years (age of first reproduction = six years x three). Three generations corresponds to 54 years.</p>","<p>Illegal trade for consumption and traditional Chinese medicine is the main threat facing <em>Cuora amboinensis</em>. It is occasionally consumed for subsistence throughout its range (Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2000, Rashid and Khan 2000, Schoppe and Das 2010), this species represented the single most numerous wild-collected turtle for the East Asian consumption trade for several years, originating mainly from Indonesia but also from other range countries (Samedi and Iskandar 2000, Shepherd 2000). Export volumes from Sumatra have declined greatly, but <em>C. amboinensis</em> remained the most common and numerous species in Indonesian turtle trade by 2010 (C. Shepherd pers. comm. Feb 2011, Schoppe 2009). Modest numbers of juveniles are traded in the regional and global pet trade. This species is also in great demand in the pet trade, with less common subspecies and localities fetching high prices.<br/><br/>Habitat impacts on the species are modest, as it is well capable of inhabiting human-dominated rice culture landscapes as long as the animals are not exploited (Schoppe and Das 2010). Pollution of waterways from oil palm run offs was also identified as a key threatening factor by Lim and Das (1999) in Malaysia.&#160;</p>","<p><em>Cuora amboinensis</em> is considered rare in Bangladesh (Das 1988 in Das 1991) or uncommon (Rashid and Khan 2000). The species was considered not rare in northeast India and the Nicobars by Das (1991), while Choudhury <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered that substantial populations occurred in several northeastern protected areas. In the central and southern Nicobar Islands <em>C. amboinensis </em>was considered very common (Andrews pers. comm. 2005). Overall the species was thought to be Vulnerable in India (Participants, Lucknow Red List Workshop, Sept 2005).<br/><br/>Research conducted in Java, Sulawesi, Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2006 indicated a decline in the mean size of individuals as a result of long-term over-exploitation of adults (Schoppe 2009). The species is considered to remain abundant in several Indonesian national parks (M. Kusrini pers. comm. Feb 2011). Population density (including immature individuals) was estimated at 60 individuals/ha in the Taman National Rawa Aopa Watomohai in the southeast of the island of Sulawesi (Schoppe 2009).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, populations of <em>Cuora amboinensis</em> are common both in natural and artificial habitats (Diesmos <em>et al</em>. 2008). Quantitative data are basically absent (Schoppe and Das 2011). Surveys of undergraduate students calculated 9.2 ind./ha in a swamp forest with adjacent coconut plantation and 3.8 ind./ha in a swamp rice field area in southern Leyte in 2010&#160;(B.A. Estrella pers. comm. to Sabine Schoppe, S. 2011), and 3.1 ind./ha in a mixed swamp-rice field habitat in southern Palawan in 2011 (Bantiling 2012). Both data sets include immature individuals.<br/><br/>It is seriously threatened in Viet Nam with “few if any viable populations” (Hendrie 2000). There are populations still surviving in protected areas, but it is heavily depleted. It is potentially being laundered through farms and legally exported to China (2837 animals were reported to be kept in farms in 2013).<br/><br/>In southwest Cambodia, the species used to be common but it is now uncommon.<br/><br/>The species is extremely rare and localised in Lao PDR (R. Timmins pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In Malaysia the turtle was considered common in the 1990s, however, numbers have since reduced and it is considered Vulnerable (Schoppe 2008). Population density (including immature individuals) in an oil palm plantation in Sabak Bernam was 0.82 individuals/ha (Schoppe 2008).<br/><br/>The species was described as numerous in Thailand in the 1970s (Nutaphand 1979), but by the 1990s population declines were reported, and by 2000 the species was best characterised as ‘uncommon’ (van Dijk and Palasuwan 2000). The species was listed as Vulnerable in the Thailand Red Data (Nabhitabhata and Chan-ard 2005); however, it is common in disturbed areas, particularly in rice fields (M. Cota pers. comm. 2018). <br/><br/>According to CITES database 2000–2017, 1,074,272 animals were exported from the range states.<br/><br/>Quantitative data are limited, but populations have likely declined substantially across most of its range due to intensive collection for the consumption trade. This use is not likely to diminish in the near future since the economic value has increased recently. It is suspected that the population of this species has been reduced by 50–80% in the past three generations (54 years).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Cuora amboinensis</em> occurs throughout Southeast Asia from northeastern India and the hills of eastern Bangladesh through mainland Southeast Asia, but not entering the hill and mountain areas north and east of the Mekong.

A total of over 20,000 live specimens, in 37 shipments, were reported as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000–2015 worldwide, the third most numerously seized CITES-listed turtle species (CITES CoP17 Doc73). Some farming occurs in China (&lt;200 animals).&#160;</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>The genus <em>Cuora</em>, including <em>C. amboinensis</em>, is included in CITES Appendix II since 2000, allowing international commercial trade in the species provided such trade is not detrimental to the species, and subject to national trade legislation. </p>  <p><em>Cuora amboinensis</em> is not listed in the Schedules of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (amended), but a revision is warranted as it likely qualifies for inclusion in Schedule IV. In Lao PDR, the species was included in Prohibited Category (I) of Decree of the Council of Ministers No. 118/CCM on the Management and Protection of Aquatic Animals, Wildlife and on Hunting and Fishing, 1989, meaning hunting and collection is permanently banned. Myanmar’s Protection of Wildlife, Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas Law, 1994, affords Protected status to <em>C. amboinensis</em>. In the Philippines,&#160;<em>C. amboinensis</em> is covered under the Philippine Wildlife Act (RA 9147), prohibiting collection and trade.&#160;The species is legally protected from exploitation in Thailand under the WARPA law of 1992. In Viet Nam, <em>C. amboinensis</em> is not specifically protected, but receives some protection under Circular 62/2001/TT-BNN (2001) which prohibits the export of various wildlife including all native turtle species, and Directive 359 (1996) restricting trade in wildlife and animal parts, including prohibiting the sale of wildlife in restaurants.&#160;In Cambodia, the species occurs in the protected Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (Platt<em> et al</em>. 2008).&#160;<em>Cuora amboinensis</em> is protected in Peninsular Malaysia and its collection is regulated in Sabah and Sarawak.&#160;The species is not protected under wildlife laws in Brunei or Indonesia, although it is known to occur in protected areas in these countries.<br/><br/>International trade in the species was brought under CITES control in 2000, and this combined with reduced export quotas from Indonesia resulted in a very significant reduction of market supply and turnover in East Asia in recent years. Some farming for the up-market consumption trade takes place in China. Captive breeding occurs in modest numbers in Europe and North America and should be sufficient to supply core turtle hobbyist demand for the species.<br/><br/><em>Cuora amboinensis</em> has been recorded from Galathea National Park&#160;(Great Nicobar), D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh), Kaziranga National Park, Manas Tiger Reserve and Orang Wildlife Sanctuary (Assam), Dipraizaikoa, and possibly Ngengpui, in India (Hanfee 1999); Ujong Kulong in Java, Indonesia; small populations&#160; have been documented in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Bung Boraphet Natural Heritage Area in Thailand (P.P. van Dijk pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Trade monitoring remains important, as are surveys of distribution and population status throughout its range, with emphasis on verifying viable populations in effectively protected areas.

Blanco-Parra and P. Charvet 2020 unpubl. data 2020) and possibly down to 50 m (Weigmann 2016).&#160;This species is an estuarine species, but it is also found on sandy areas near reefs adjacent to brackish lagoons and mangroves (O'Shea <em>et al. </em>2017, Sales <em>et al.</em> 2020, P. Charvet unpubl. data 2020).&#160;It reaches a maximum size of 180 cm disc width (DW); size-at-maturity is unknown but males are still immature at 60 cm DW (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016). Little else is known of its biology. There is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Diamond Stingray (<em>Hypanus dipterurus</em>) which has a generation length of 18.8 years (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Atlantic Chupare has a larger maximum size (180 cm DW) than the Diamond Stingray (100 cm DW), therefore generation length was scaled to be ~25 years, although this generation is likely to be a poor proxy of generation length as the two species are in different families.</p>","<p></p>The Atlantic Chupare is caught by artisanal fisheries in nets and on hook-and-line, and it is also caught in commercial shrimp trawl and purse seine fisheries (Almeida&#160;<em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.&#160;</em>2008, Briones 2017, O'Shea&#160;<em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.&#160;</em>2017,&#160;Marceniuk <em>et al. </em>2019,&#160;Santander-Neto and Faria 2020). In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001). Despite some area closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015). In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016, Santana <em>et al. </em>2020). In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016). Coral reefs and seagrasses in the area are degraded by coastal development, pollution, and climate change (Leão <em>et al.</em> 2010, Copertino <em>et al. </em>2016), and this is leading to a decline in habitat quality for this species.","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Catches of<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""> the Atlantic Chupare are considered low at present in the Caribbean (C.

It was also previously common in Venezuela but has disappeared from several localities and is now found mostly only in estuaries (O. Lasso pers. comm. 25 July 2018). There are no data for the Guianas, but there are intense artisanal fisheries there, and it is suspected that these are leading to some reduction in population size. The situation is similar in northern Brazil, as this species was common in the 1970s&#160;(P.

3091753,60201,Sphyrna media,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2020,2019-02-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Scoophead Shark (<em>Sphyrna media</em>) is a medium-sized (to 150 cm total length) hammerhead that occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from the Gulf of California, Mexico to northern Peru and in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Panama to southern Brazil. It inhabits waters over continental shelves from inshore to 100 m depth. It is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, which are typically unmanaged and operate throughout its range. It may also be caught in trawl fisheries. The declining numbers of records over the past several decades and range contraction in some areas indicates that this shark has undergone population reduction in both the Pacific and the Atlantic. In the Pacific, records have become increasingly rare and this species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Records are sparse from elsewhere in Pacific Mexico and Central America and occur rarely in Colombia and Ecuador. The Atlantic South American portion of the population has also been reduced in size substantially. Off Caribbean Colombia, this species is considered rare. In Venezuela, it is subjected to intense and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it is suspected to have undergone population reduction there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across the Guianas. Many elasmobranchs are at high risk of extinction in the north of Brazil, and it is suspected that this species has also been overfished there. There have been very sparse records in Bahia state;&#160;records of sphyrnid sharks there have been declining in number since the 1990s, and since 2000 have only occurred very rarely. There are no recent records from southern Brazil. Overall, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, as well as the degradation of mangrove habitats, and has undergone range retractions in some areas. There have been very few recent records and it is inferred that the Scoophead Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% based on levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","The Scoophead Shark inhabits waters over continental shelves from inshore to 100 m depth (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL); females mature at 100–133 cm TL and males at 90–100 cm TL; reproduction is placental viviparous and females give birth to young that are 34 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Generation length is suspected to be about 12 years, based on available data for the congeneric Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 7 years and a maximum recorded age of 18 years (Frazier <em>et al. </em>2014).","The Scoophead Shark is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, and may also be caught in trawl fisheries. This hammerhead is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, it has no refuge at depth, and it has been depleted in several areas. <br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, gillnets that   often target sharks have been operating for many decades in   the Gulf of California, Mexico, and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and   other marine life (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Unmanaged artisanal fisheries   targeting sharks including this species have been  operating  around   Mazatlan since at least the 1960s (Kato 1965), although there is a three-month seasonal ban on the take of sharks that has been in place since 2012. Further south in this  portion of the  species' range, intense artisanal fishing pressure exists  with little  management in place, and there are commercial  longline and  trawl fisheries off many areas of Pacific Central and  South America. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">In the Atlantic part of its range, artisanal   fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America,   and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries   in many areas. Caribbean Colombia is dominated by artisanal fisheries  and there were an estimated 14,000 artisanal fishers on the Colombian  coast in the Caribbean in 2006 (Wielgus <em>et al</em>. 2010). Since  1995, fishers there have reported decreased mesh sizes, the addition  of hooks to gillnets, and spatial expansion of fisheries and subsequent  increased fishing pressure on chondrichthyans (Marrugo <em>et al.</em>  2015). Industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating  at ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast in the mid-1960s and  expanded until the 1980s when overfishing began (Wielgus <em>et al. </em>2010). These fisheries are known to catch the congener Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>) (Acevedo <em>et al.</em>  2007) and are likely to also capture this species. Effort in this  fishery peaked in 1990 and declined substantially until the early 2000s (<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">García <em>et al. </em>2007).  Furthermore, lack of enforcement capacity has led to illegal fishing by  Honduran and Nicaraguan vessels in Colombian waters (Wielgus <em>et al.</em>  2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are  intense,  lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed  by  declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015).  Groundfish fisheries on  the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully  over-exploited by 2000;  these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with  vessels crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001).  Despite some areal closures and the  implementation of a total allowable  catch of target species, there is  now a diminished effort and number of  vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em>  2015). Gillnets and  artisanal longlines are prevalent along much of  Brazil's coast, other Sphyrnids are captured by them (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2014), and this species is also likely to be caught. <span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">In  northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of  target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s  (Vasconcellos<em> et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and  unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the  disappearance of several other elasmobranch species in the region  (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016). In  northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense,  gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that  stocks are over-exploited, and other sharks have been depleted including congeners  (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014).  In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a  period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650  vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016).  Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted  by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being  collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2019).

In the Eastern Central Pacific, this shark was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and off the Pacific coast of Mexico (Hernández-Carvallo 1967). Records became increasingly rare from the 1980s onwards, and it is no longer present in the Gulf of California; there were only three records from Mexico in the two decades leading up to 2014, all of which were restricted to southern Mexico (Pérez-Jiménez 2014, Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 2017). Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca (Pérez-Jiménez 2014, J.-C. Pérez-Jiménez unpubl. data 2018). This shark has not been encountered in Pacific Central America since the 1980s; there are more recent records in Colombia and Ecuador, but they are rare (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). There were records in the industrial trawl fishery in Colombia in the 1990s, but surveys of this fishery in 2007 did not record any <em>Sphyrna </em>species (Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016). To summarize the situation in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, due to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, its recent absence from large parts of Mexico and Central America, and rarity of recent records across this part of its range, it is inferred that this shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (36 years) in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific.<br/><br/>The Atlantic South American portion of the population has been reduced in size substantially. Off Caribbean Colombia, this shark has been very rarely reported (Grijalba <em>et al</em>. 2009, García and Armenteras 2015), and is thought to never have been common. In Venezuela, it is subjected to intense and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it is suspected to have undergone population reduction there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across the Guianas. In Brazil, intense fishing pressure is suspected to have led to a population reduction. Many elasmobranchs are at high risk of extinction in the north of Brazil, and it is suspected that this species has also been overfished there. There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state; records of sphyrnid sharks there became increasingly rare during the 1990s, and since 2000 have only occurred very rarely (Reis-Filho <em>et al</em>. 2014). To summarize the situation in Atlantic South America, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, and there have been very few recent records. It is therefore inferred that the Atlantic South American portion of this species' population has undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).<br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Scoophead Shark occurred historically in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from the Gulf of California, Mexico to northern Peru and in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Panama to southern Brazil (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).

This is an important market fish throughout its range but is not often found in large quantities. It is fished heavily in certain areas, but is also found in numerous remote localities where it is not subjected to heavy fishing pressure. It is also a good aquaculture species because it does not get rancid easily when frozen. Although there have been some local declines in certain areas of its range, such as the Persian Gulf, it is common and locally abundant in other parts of its range. Numerous marine protected areas exist throughout its distribution. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.","<em>Lutjanus argentimaculatus</em> is an oceanodromous, reef-associated species. Juveniles and young adults occur in mangrove estuaries, as well as the lower reaches of freshwater streams and tidal creeks (Sommer <em>et al.</em> 1996 ). Adults are often found in groups around coral reefs (Lieske and Myers 1994) and eventually migrate offshore to deeper reef areas, sometimes penetrating to depths in excess of 100 m. Females are generally larger than males of the same age (Russell <em>et al.</em> 2003). This nocturnal species feeds mostly on fishes and crustaceans. This is an important market species throughout the Indo-Pacific region (Anderson and Allen 2001). Longevity is estimated to be 37 years (Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Spawning occurs off the coast of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi from September to October (Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). The annual average fecundity is 4 million eggs (Russell <em>et al.</em> 2003). The mean age and size at first sexual maturity for female <em>Lutjanus aregentimaculatus</em> are 14.0 and 56.4 cm FL, respectively, while males reach first sexual maturity at 13.0 yrs and 55.8 cm FL, respectively (Grandcourt <em>et al</em>. 2013). The maximum recorded total length of this species is 150 cm (Torres 1991). The natural mortality for this species is measured at&#160;0.158 (Russell <em>et al. </em>2003)","This species is an important market species and is considered overexploited in some areas (e.g., United Arab Emirates).

In addition, in some areas (e.g., the Persian Gulf),&#160;the habitat for juveniles for this species has been seriously degraded. The juveniles depend on mangroves, which have been destroyed for coastal development projects, and depend on some amount of fresh water (inhabit brakish water), which is decreasing. However, we are lacking quantitative data that indicates the Gulf serves as a nursery area for juveniles (Grandcourt <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/>This species is utilized for commercial aquaculture&#160;in Pakistan, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines (Emata 1996, Emata&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Hong and Zhang 2002).","This species is often observed in the markets, but not in large numbers (G.

3292503,11534,Lepidochelys olivacea,Vulnerable,A2bd,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Assessment procedure</span><br/>In accordance with the IUCN guidelines for Red List Assessments, the focus of this evaluation has been the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001). For Olive Ridleys, as with other sea turtle species, as it is not possible to survey mature individuals we used an index of abundance in the form of the number of annual nesting females. Although not all females breed every year (see section on Reproduction below) and males are not evaluated, this index is considered to be the most reliable estimator for long-term population trends of marine turtles since the proportion of the total number of females that nest in any given year and the sex ratio is believed to be fairly constant across time within and between subpopulations (Meylan 1982, Limpus 1996).<br/><br/>Direct counts of the number of nesting females (NF) are not always available so we also relied on alternative information that can be converted to NF: number of nests per season, nests/km/yr or number of protected nests per season; annual estimates of hatchling or egg production, or census estimates of nesting females from arribada rookeries. When these proxies were used, the counted units were converted to NF based on the following constants: 105 eggs/nest and 2.5 nests/season/female. Some conservation programs reported annual number of protected nests but did not include the quantity of poached or otherwise destroyed or predated nests. For these cases we extrapolated to the total number of nests based on local estimates of conservation efficiency. All conversions to NF were made under the assumptions that (a) the mean number of eggs/nest and the number of nests/female/season do not differ significantly over the timescales we have used; and (b) the effort and the coverage of the biological parameters we used are reasonably constant through the time frame evaluated. In cases where the different surveys involved different levels of coverage, explicit corrections were made and specified in the result tables.<br/><br/>In spite of the Olive Ridley being the most abundant sea turtle, available quantitative information is extremely scarce and unevenly distributed across regions. We thus relied on a subset of the world’s rookeries which, we assume, exhibit population trends that are representative of the population as a whole or, at least, for each of the regions. We selected 28 Index Sites (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below) for which reasonably long time series of quantitative data are available. They include all the largest known populations, as well as an assortment of smaller rookeries from almost all of the regions where the species is found. All sites are assumed to be demographically independent. However, although genetic data indicate a high degree of inter-rookery migration between some rookeries (e.g., Brazil-Suriname- Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (1998); between México to Central America in the Eastern Pacific- Briseño-Dueñas (1998)) the results reflect events within an evolutionary timescale (many generations). Within the time span relevant to the assessment (two to three generations), available evidence suggests significant demographic independence between the pairs of rookeries in question (e.g., mark-recapture in Nancite and Ostional indicate the vast majority are different turtles- reviewed by Bernardo and Plotkin (2007); absence of exchange by tagged turtles and non-overlapping nesting seasons Brazil vs Suriname/French Guiana- de Silva et al. (in press); and the lack of re-colonization of depleted arribadas in Jalisco and Guerrero in México by the very large Escobilla rookery, 500 to 1,000 km distant in over four decades).<br/><br/>The population abundance estimates were based on raw data or on extrapolations from regressions performed on available data. As the relatively data-rich trends consistently indicated exponential trajectories we relied on these as the method of choice for extrapolations. Some data sets contained a number of trajectories across the time frames employed and in these more than one regression was employed or a combination of regressions and raw data. We have constrained our back extrapolations to time spans close to known historical events that are believed to have defined major abundance changes in order to avoid gross exaggerations with no supporting evidence. This has, however, meant that in some cases the extrapolations have only been performed back two generations (40 years) and could be considered underestimates of decline.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the assessment process</span><br/>Calculations based on very different datasets obtained by different workgroups, using multiple survey methods and spanning many decades are fraught with uncertainties. A number of these could be biasing our assessment. (1) Combining abundance information for individual rookeries obtained with a number of different methodologies could provide a source of error. However, we believe that the magnitude of these errors is of minor significance to the final declines estimated. (2) Because of the assessment’s requirement for quantitative information, a very small proportion of the total known rookeries were included, and some regions are not well represented. The bias this introduces is further augmented since it is most likely that rookeries having long time series of data are also the most monitored and hence the better protected. In this case the estimates of decline will be underestimated relative to the true trends for the more numerous and less well monitored/protected rookeries. This is likely the case for regions with little (Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean) or no (entire Eastern Atlantic) representation in our assessment that contribute very little to our global decline values yet where reports with qualitative evidence indicate extensive population declines (reviewed by Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Nonetheless, although ideally a global assessment should incorporate full data from all regions to derive robust evaluations, the available information on the geographic distribution of abundances suggests that the largest rookeries are concentrated in regions with good representation and thus their inclusion will not significantly affect the global results. This is reflected at the regional level and in results for non-arribada rookeries where our sample bias will probably have caused an underestimation of true decline levels. (3) The extent of extrapolations into time past is an aspect that will undoubtedly contribute to the uncertainty of the results, particularly with scarce information. We have avoided extrapolating far beyond the oldest datasets to avoid this type of errors and thus consider that our results are conservative.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Rationale for the Red List Assessment</span>:<br/>In spite of scarcity in historical data, information from diverse sources has made it possible to evaluate a global decline for this widely distributed species over time periods ranging from decades to 2-3 generations. Striking regional differences are observed in the estimations that undoubtedly indicate far lower survival probabilities in some of the regions than what the global results would suggest.<br/><br/>There was also a stark and recurring contrast between the decline estimates for subpopulations grouped according to breeding strategy- arribada or non-arribada (solitary). The global decline rate estimated from non-arribada subpopulations (-63 to -83%) reflects a widespread low conservation status for these types of subpopulations that suggests they haven’t recovered to historical (pre 1960) levels even in regions with long-term protection programs (e.g., over four decades in México) in spite generalized increments over the last decade (Márquez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). This needs to be highlighted because rookeries with non-arribada behavior are many times more numerous than those that nest as arribadas (e.g., in México about 98% of Olive Ridley subpopulations are non-arribada). Yet, as their abundances are up to three to four orders of magnitude smaller than arribada rookeries, they have an insignificant influence on the global decline estimates. In fact, the global net decline for the Olive Ridley is driven principally by population trends in just two arribada populations, Escobilla (México) and Ostional (Costa Rica), both in the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>The global decline value estimated on the basis of estimated population reductions of the annual number of Olive Ridley nesting females at subpopulations in the Index Sites used ranged between 31 and 36% (see Table 3 in the Supplementary Material, see below). As most of the back extrapolations were limited to two generations it is likely that this value is conservative.<br/><br/>When deciding whether to apply Red List decline criterion A1 (the causes of reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased) or A2 (the causes of reduction may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible) to obtain decline thresholds for the listing process three characteristics of the species’ decline need to be analyzed (SPWG 2006): (1) is the reduction reversible?, (2) are the causes of the reduction identified and understood?, and (3) have the threatening factors ceased? Since the decline estimated is driven by result from arribada rookeries, the questions need to be addressed against what is known for these types of populations. While it would appear that the elimination of large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley for leather and local consumption has allowed for the stabilization of a significant portion of rookeries, particularly in the Eastern Pacific and in particular facilitated the growth of arribada rookeries such as Escobilla and Ostional, the population growth of Mismaloya, Tlalcoyunque and Chacahua in the same region and under similar conservation circumstances remain at reduced abundances well below an arribada category. This could indicate that under some circumstances, the reduction of arribada rookeries below a certain level can make it impossible or unlikely for it to recover an arribada behavior. The major cause for the reduction in the species is thought to have been the massive commercial over-exploitations, particularly in the Eastern Pacific. Furthermore, we do not yet fully understand nor are able to manage other stressors, some intrinsic or at least due to interactions between the overcrowding of growing populations that equally provoke dramatic declines in arribadas such as that of Nancite in spite of decades of protection (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Though commercial exploitation of Olive Ridleys for international markets has effectively been eliminated, at local levels significant factors continue to impact individual rookeries such as excessive egg exploitation (e.g., Isla Caña, Panama) or bycatch (such as in Orissa, India). These examples indicate that Olive Ridleys, under current circumstances, do not meet all of the conditions for A1 and hence should be evaluated under criterion A2.<br/><br/>Under A2, the decline estimations obtained for the Olive Ridley Turtle at a global scale correspond to the Vulnerable IUCN Red List threshold (a decline of &gt;30% but &lt;50%.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Like most other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys display a complex life cycle, which requires a range of geographically separated localities and multiple habitats (Márquez 1990). Females lay their nests on coastal sandy beaches from which neonates emerge and enter the marine environment to continue their development. They remain in a pelagic phase, drifting passively with major currents that disperse far from their natal sites, with juveniles sharing some of the adults’ habitats (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000) until sexual maturity is reached (Musick and Limpus 1997). Reproductively active males and females migrate toward coastal zones and concentrate near nesting beaches. However, some males appear to remain in oceanic waters and mate with females en route to their nesting beaches (Plotkin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). Their post-breeding migrations are complex, with pathways varying annually (Plotkin 1994) and with no apparent migratory corridors, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometers over large ocean expanses (Morreale <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), commonly within the 20°C isotherms (Márquez 1990). In the East Pacific, they are present from 30°N to 15°S and often seen within 1,200 nautical miles from shore although they have been sighted as far as 140°W (IATTC 2004). Western Atlantic Olive Ridleys appear to remain in neritic waters after breeding (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Demographic features / Reproduction</span><br/>The species displays three modes of reproduction: arribada, dispersed nesting, and mixed strategy (Bernardo and Plotkin 2007). The first mode represents a synchronous, mass nesting behaviour that may include hundreds to thousands of females over a period of days and occurs in fewer than a dozen places worldwide. The more common form of nesting is dispersed or “solitary” with no apparent synchronicity between individual events. At some localities, a mixture of these two forms of nesting can also occur. In general, individual Olive Ridleys may nest one, two or three times per season, with approximately 100–110 eggs per clutch (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995). For this assessment we have used an average number of 2.5 nests/female/season and 105 eggs/nest. In contrast to other sea turtle species, the reproductive cycle is nearly annual (over 60% of turtles nest every year; Márquez 1990). Solitary nesters oviposit on 14 day cycles whereas arribada nesters approximately every 28 days (Pritchard 1969, Kalb and Owens 1994, Kalb 1999). Kalb (1999) found that within a nesting season solitary nesters use multiple beaches for oviposition but arribada nesters display nest site fidelity. There are extreme variations in hatching rates between nesting beaches, however, in general they are much higher in solitary nesting beaches where around 80% is common and sometimes even higher (Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). It is widely recognized that survivorship is extremely low on high-density arribada nesting beaches because of density-dependent mortality (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991) leading to hatching rates as low as 1 to 8% (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Moreover, turtles return approximately every month during a discrete nesting season (three to six months) and nests that remained intact during the previous month are again at risk when new waves of turtles crawl ashore. On solitary nesting beaches, where density-dependent mortality is not a factor, hatching rates are significantly higher (Castro 1986, Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Post-hatching survivorship is unknown and there is no information available on recruitment rates. Presumably, like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys experience high mortality in their early life stages. Juveniles are believed to occur in similar habitats as the adults (i.e,. pelagic waters) where they forage on gelatinous prey such as jellyfish, salps and tunicates (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).","Like other long-lived species, Olive Ridleys are prone to population declines because of slow intrinsic growth rate in combination with anthropogenic impacts. These can accumulate over a protracted development through various life stages, multiple habitats (nesting beaches, migratory routes and pelagic foraging zones) and vast geographic expanses.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Targeted exploitation</span><br/>Egg harvest. Olive Ridleys and their eggs have been harvested, mostly unsustainably, worldwide. However, the current impact is difficult to evaluate because of other simultaneous factors such as incidental take in commercial fisheries. Nonetheless, there is documentation of recent egg use causing declines (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). From México to Colombia, Olive Ridley eggs have been and still are used for personal and commercial use (Lagueux 1989, Arauz 2000, Campbell 2007, Cornelius et al. 2007). Laws regulating turtle egg use vary among countries, and even where laws prohibit egg use, illegal use of Olive Ridley eggs is believed to be widespread because enforcement is either non-existent or insufficient. On unprotected solitary nesting beaches (most are unprotected), egg extraction often approaches 100%. Human use of turtle eggs for consumption and domestic animal consumption historically was widespread in the Indian Ocean and continues today largely wherever Ridleys nest (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Egg use has been reported in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Pakistan and Malaysia and is believed to have caused the decline of Olive Ridleys in these countries (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Even at monitored beaches a proportion of the eggs are still lost to poaching.<br/><br/>Directed take of adults. In the East Pacific, although Olive Ridley turtle fisheries are now closed, illegal take of adult turtles still occurs widely with an unknown level of impact. There is evidence that thousands of Olive Ridleys are still taken each year along the Pacific coast of México (Frazier et al. 2007). In the West Atlantic, the direct take of adults has diminished over time to negligible levels (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). In the Indian Ocean, the use of adult Olive Ridleys and their eggs for personal use has been and continues to be widespread (Frazier 1982, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), and market-driven harvesting of eggs and females from nesting beaches are considered the greatest threat (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Personal, subsistence use of adult Olive Ridley turtles is widespread worldwide (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Olive Ridleys and/or their eggs are used along the entire coast of West Africa (including Macaronesia) and sold in local and regional markets (Fretey 2001).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bycatch in fisheries</span><br/>The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys occurs worldwide in trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seines, gill net and other net fisheries and hook and line fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The impact of the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in fisheries has been well documented for some regions but not for others. In some locations where by-catch statistics are unavailable from fisheries, cause and effect has been used to implicate a fishery in the decline of Olive Ridleys. The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in the shrimp trawl fishery in the western Atlantic, is believed to be the main cause of the significant population decline observed there since the 1970s and currently the number of Olive Ridleys by caught in trawl fisheries off the coasts of Surinam and French Guiana is believed to be approximately a couple of thousand turtles annually (Godfrey and Chevalier 2004, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Gillnets and other fishing methods in this region also capture Olive Ridleys incidentally but to a lesser extent than shrimp trawl fishery (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Bycatch in trawl fisheries off Sergipe State in Brazil is considered the most pressing threat to that population (Thomé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the eastern Atlantic, the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys by commercial fisheries is thought to be a significant threat but very little systematic data is available (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental mortality of Olive Ridleys is worst along the coast of Orissa, India with arribada Olive Ridleys gathering to nest were fishing effort is high. Every year since the early 1980s, thousands or tens of thousands of Olive Ridleys have stranded dead on the Orissa beaches, presumably as a result of incidental capture in shrimp trawls (Pandav 2000). A gill net fishery also operates in the region and contributes to the ridley mortality along this coastline. Incidental capture in fisheries is also believed to be a serious threat in the eastern Pacific (Frazier et al. 2007) where Olive Ridleys aggregate in large numbers off shore from nesting beaches (Kalb <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Kalb 1999), but the information available is incomplete (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995, NMFS/USFWS 1998). Incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in this region has been documented in shrimp trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seine fishery and gill net fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a serious threat along the coast of Central America, with an estimated annual capture for all species of marine turtle exceeding 60,000 turtles, most of which are Olive Ridleys (Arauz 1996). Recent growth in the longline fisheries of this region are also a serious and growing threat to Olive Ridleys and have the potential to capture hundreds of thousands of Ridleys annually (Frazier et al., 2007). Bycatch of Olive Ridleys is high in Indonesian tuna long-lines and shrimp trawls although mortality appears to be low (WWF Indonesia, unpublished data).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitat impacts</span><br/>Degradation, transformation and destruction of natural conditions at nesting beaches from coastal developments continue to threaten the long-term survival of many Olive Ridley rookeries. Transformation of nesting habitat comes from the construction of new aquaculture ponds, fishing harbours and tourist facilities, as well as growth of existing coastal villages which are increasing in many parts of the world within the range of the Olive Ridley, particularly along the east coast of India (Pandav and Choudhury 1999) and in some zones in coastal México to Central America (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). These impacts contribute stress directly through the loss of nesting habitat or indirectly through changes in the thermal profiles of the beach, increased light pollution (Witherington 1992) and sewage effluents.<br/><br/>Global warming has the potential to impact the habitats and ecosystems of Olive Ridley populations worldwide (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Weishampal 2004) but the specific impacts are purely speculative at this time. Most accounts have focused on the impact of global warming on incubation temperatures of eggs, which influence the sex ratio of the embryos (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Diseases and predation</span><br/>Extremely little is known about diseases and their effects on Olive Ridley abundance. The only disease identified in the literature for Olive Ridleys is fibropapilloma, a herpes-virus found in sea turtles nearly worldwide (Herbst 1994). The incidence of fibropapilloma is not believed to be high in Olive Ridleys but has been observed in Olive Ridleys nesting in Costa Rica (Herbst 1994) and in México (Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). At some individual rookeries, the predation by wild pigs and/or feral dogs can be substantial (e.g., in the Andaman Islands; Andrews et al. 2001). Infestation of developing eggs by fly and beetle larvae can cause significant mortality of embryos. In an extremely worrying case, the beetle larvae (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Omorgus suberosus fabricius</span>) has become a plague in the world’s largest arribada rookery in Escobilla, México where it is provoking steep drops in the hatching efficiency of the clutches laid, from a typical 30% for this colony (Márquez 1990) to less than 5% in some areas (López-Reyes and Harfush 2000). When combined with the relatively low hatching rates of high-density arribada beaches and the destruction of eggs laid by previous nesters, this problem could provoke the rookery’s decline.","<p>For the purposes of Red List assessments, generation length is defined as the “average age of parents” (IUCN 2001). Since this information is not available from direct observation of sea turtle species we derived a comparable value from estimates of age at which 50% of the breeders are expected to have survived, using information for age at sexual maturity and adult survival rates. An important caveat is that, while it is known that different populations of the same species can attain sexual maturity at different ages (Heppell <em>et al.</em> 2003) and therefore different values would need to be taken into account for different regions, the information is only available for a single region and we have had to assume the estimated values are generally applicable on a global scale. The only published study on growth and age for Olive Ridleys (Zug <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates a mean age at sexual maturity for North-central Pacific Ridley sea turtles of around 13 years (range of 10-18 years). We calculated the time it would take for a cohort of breeders to reach 50% of its original size from S<sup>n</sup> =50%, where <span times="""" new="""" roman="""">n is years since age at first reproduction, and S is annual survival. Solving for n, n = ln(0.5)/ln(S). As extensive estimates of annual survival rates for female nesters are only available from the better studied sister taxon, <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em>, (TEWG 2000) we used these, which have a range of 85-92% per year. Thus, n<sub>50% </sub>= 4-9 yrs and our derived average age of female Olive Ridley parents is 17-22 years. We additionally assumed that this value would be the same for male parents. For simplicity, we have used a value of 20 yrs for the species’ generation length in this assessment.</p>",Decreasing,"The Olive Ridley sea turtle has a circumtropical distribution, with nesting occurring throughout tropical waters (except the Gulf of Mexico) and migratory circuits in tropical and some subtropical areas (Atlantic Ocean – eastern central, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, western central; Indian Ocean – eastern, western; Pacific Ocean – eastern central, northwest, southwest, western central) (Pritchard 1969). Nesting occurs in nearly 60 countries worldwide. Migratory movements are less well studied than other marine turtle species but are known to involve coastal waters of over 80 countries (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below). With very few exceptions they are not known to move between ocean basins or to cross from one ocean border to the other. Within a region, Olive Ridleys may move between the oceanic and neritic zones (Plotkin <em>et al.</em> 1995, Shanker <em>et al</em>. 2003) or just occupy neritic waters (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Most of the conservation actions on behalf of the Olive Ridley at national and international levels have been based on the species’ listing under the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Endangered </span>category in the IUCN Red List. As an Appendix I species under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) the international trade of skins from the species, which fuelled the large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley from the 1960s into the 1980s was effectively halted. Other relevant international instruments that list the Olive Ridley as threatened and hence obligate its conservation by member states include: the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC). CMS-promoted Memoranda of Understanding for the conservation and management of marine turtles and their habitats have been signed by the Olive Ridley’s range states in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (known as IOSEA) as well as in other regions such as the Atlantic Coast of Africa under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa where 21 out of 26 range states participate.<br/><br/>On the basis of the species’ classification in the IUCN Red List or in national endangered species lists, local legislatures of range states confer protection to the Olive Ridley. Although this sanctions law-enforcement, the implementation remains patchy at the global scale because of paucity in enforcement capabilities. Successful conservation has usually relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local and non-governmental organizations incorporating public outreach. Statutory use and enforcement of the Turtle Excluder Devices in the shrimp trawlers has also proven critical in some areas with high levels of interaction with this fishery.<br/><br/>Despite the legislative efforts to protect the Olive Ridley, human impacts continue to be significant. In some areas (such as West Africa and South East Asia), extensive monitoring needs to be implemented to identify regions and stressors requiring priority actions. Bycatch and illegal take particularly from the coastal, artisanal fisheries need to be evaluated through adequate on-board observer programs and properly addressed. The beetle infestation of the Escobilla rookery must be adequately evaluated and acceptable measures of biological control of the insect need to be implemented.

Overall, the general biodiversity and productivity, including that of economically valuable species in the lake, is under threat. Uncontrolled expansion of prawn aquaculture into the lake is expected to exacerbate this threat (Finlayson <em>et al.</em> 2001).  <br/><br/>Soil erosion is prevalent in the catchment of Chilika due to over-grazing, illicit felling, cultivation along hill slopes, and clearance of vegetation for rehabilitation and agriculture.

When ambient water temperatures drop below 20°C (68°F) in autumn and winter, manatees aggregate at natural and artificial warm-water refuges or move to southern Florida (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001, Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Most artificial refuges are created by warm-water outfalls from power plants. The largest winter aggregations (maximum count of 100 or more animals) are at refuges in central and southern Florida. The northernmost natural warm-water refuges used regularly by manatees are at Crystal River on the west coast and at Blue Spring in the St. Johns River on the east coast. Most manatees return to the same warm-water refuges each year; however, some use different refuges in different years and others use two or more refuges in the same winter (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, Deutsch 2000, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Many minor aggregation sites are used as temporary thermal refuges. Most of these refuges are deeper canals or boat basins where warmer water temperatures persist as temperatures in adjacent bays and rivers decline. Manatees using thermal refuges move to nearby grassbeds to feed (generally within 30 km), and may even return to a more distant warm season range during mild periods in mid-winter (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>As water temperatures rise manatees disperse from winter aggregation areas. While some remain near their winter refuges, most undertake extensive travels along the coast and some move far up rivers and canals. On the east coast, summer sightings drop off rapidly north of Georgia (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001) and are rare north of Cape Hatteras (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1982, Schwartz 1995); the northernmost published sighting is from Rhode Island (Reid 1996, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). On the west coast, sightings drop off sharply west of the Suwannee River in Florida (Marine Mammal Commission 1986), although a small number of manatees are seen each summer in the Wakulla River at the base of the Florida Panhandle. Rare sightings also have been made in the Dry Tortugas (Reynolds and Ferguson 1984) and the Bahamas (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001; Odell <em>et al</em>. 1978; Reid 2000, 2001). As in winter, manatees show strong site fidelity to the same summer habitats year after year (Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, Koelsch 1997, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>In recent years, the most important spring habitat along the east coast of Florida has been the northern Banana River and Indian River Lagoon and their associated waters in Brevard County; more than 300 to 500 manatees have been counted in this area shortly before dispersing in late spring (Provancha and Provancha 1988, FWC unpubl.). A comparable spring aggregation area does not appear to exist on the west coast, although Charlotte Harbor was visited in the spring by almost half of the 35 manatees radio-tagged at the Fort Myers power plant in Lee County (Lefebvre and Frohlich 1986). During summer, manatees may be commonly found almost anywhere in Florida where water depths and access channels are greater than 1 m (O’Shea 1988). Manatees can be found in very shallow water. Hartman (1979) observed manatees utilizing waters as shallow as 0.4 m with their backs out of the water. In warm seasons they usually occur alone or in pairs, although interacting groups of five to ten animals are not unusual.<br/><br/>Migration corridors and responses by individual animals have been elaborated by long-term telemetry studies (Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Scientists have demonstrated site-fidelity in manatees, but have also noted that individual animals adjust their behaviours to take advantage of protected areas or changes in availability of resources. For example, Buckingham <em>et al</em>. (1999) confirmed increased manatee use of selected sanctuary areas during times when surrounding disturbance by boats was high.<br/><br/>Shallow grass beds with ready access to deep channels are preferred feeding areas in coastal and riverine habitats. Manatees often use secluded canals, creeks, embayments, and lagoons, particularly near the mouths of coastal rivers and sloughs, for feeding, resting, cavorting, mating, and calving. In estuarine and brackish areas, natural and artificial fresh water sources are sought by manatees.  Although manatees can tolerate a wide range of salinities (Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 1998), they prefer habitats where osmotic stress is minimal or where fresh water is periodically available (O’Shea and Kochman 1990). Ortiz <em>et al</em>. (1998) report that “manatees may be susceptible to dehydration after an extended period if freshwater is not available”.<br/><br/>Manatees are herbivores that feed opportunistically on a wide variety of submerged, floating, and emergent vegetation. Because of their broad distribution and migratory patterns, Florida manatees utilize a wider diversity of food items and are possibly less specialized in their feeding strategies than manatees in tropical regions (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). Seagrasses appear to be a staple of the manatee diet in coastal areas (Smith 1990, Provancha and Hall 1991, Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). Packard (1984) noted two feeding methods in coastal seagrass beds: (1) rooting, where virtually the entire plant is consumed; and (2) grazing, where exposed grass blades are eaten without disturbing the roots or sediment. Manatees may return to specific seagrass beds to graze on new growth (Koelsch 1997, Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the upper Banana River, Provancha and Hall (1991) found spring concentrations of manatees grazing in beds dominated by manatee grass (<em>Syringodium filiforme</em>). They also reported an apparent preference for manatee grass and shoalgrass (<em>Halodule wrightii</em>) over the macroalga <em>Caulerpa</em> spp. Along the Florida-Georgia border, manatees feed in salt marshes on smooth cordgrass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>) by timing feeding periods with high tide (Baugh <em>et al</em>. 1989, Zoodsma 1991).<br/><br/>Breeding takes place when one or more males (ranging from 5 to 22) are attracted to an oestrous female to form an ephemeral mating herd (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Mating herds can last up to four weeks, with different males joining and leaving the herd daily (Hartman 1979, Bengtson 1981, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Permanent bonds between males and females do not form. During peak activity, the males in mating herds compete intensely for access to the female (Hartman 1979). Successive copulations involving different males have been reported. Some observations suggest that larger, presumably older, males dominate access to females early in the formation of mating herds and are responsible for most pregnancies (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995), but males as young as three years old are spermatogenic (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995). Although breeding has been reported in all seasons, Hernandez <em>et al</em>. (1995) reported that histological studies of reproductive organs from carcasses of males found evidence of sperm production in 94% of adult males recovered from March through November. Only 20% of adult males recovered from December through February showed similar production.<br/><br/>Females appear to reach sexual maturity by about age five but have given birth as early as four (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, O’Shea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995), and males may reach sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years of age (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995). Manatees may live in excess of 50 years (Marmontel 1995), and evidence for reproductive senescence is unclear (Marmontel 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Wild females have been documented continuing to calve into their late 30s (USGS-Sirenia, unpubl.), and a captive animal gave birth in her mid-40s (FWS, unpubl.). The length of the gestation period is uncertain but is thought to be between 11 and 14 months (Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). The normal litter size is one, with twins reported rarely (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, O’Shea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Calf dependency usually lasts one to two years after birth (Hartman 1979, O’Shea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). Calving intervals average about 2.5 years (when the calf survives to weaning), but they vary greatly among individuals and may be considerably longer depending on age and perhaps other factors (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). Females that abort or lose a calf due to perinatal death may become pregnant again within a few months (Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995), or even weeks (Hartman 1979).<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>The habitat and ecology of the Antillean manatee is thought to be similar to its sister subspecies. However, given that the Florida manatee inhabits the most northern extent of the species range, behaviour and life history characteristics may be dissimilar in this tropical subspecies. Antillean manatees use rivers, lakes, coastal and inland lagoons, and coastal marine environments, including seagrass, mangrove, and coral reef ecosystems. Although they are able to survive in fresh, estuarine, or marine environments for extended periods of time, several lines of evidence indicate a dependence on periodic access to fresh water for osmoregulation (Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 1998, 1999; Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001; Reid <em>et al</em>. 2003). As herbivores, access to aquatic vegetation is necessary for survival; seagrasses (<em>Thalassia, Halodule, Halophila</em> and <em>Syringodium</em>) appear to be favored in estuarine and marine areas. Osmoregulation and thermoregulation are behaviorally controlled by movements between activity centers. Quiet protected areas are necessary for resting and for cows with young calves; connections (travel corridors) between feeding, drinking, nursery, mating, and resting areas are very important. A discussion of the environmental factors influencing seasonal movements and migratory behavior in both subspecies is provided in Deutsch <em>et al</em>. (2003).","<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>Threats to the Florida manatee encompass catastrophic natural events and anthropogenic factors that could cause declines in reproductive and survival rates or declines in the carrying capacity of the environment. Much of the following text is modified from the Biological Status Reviews for the Florida manatee (FWC 2002, Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Anthropogenic Threats</strong><br/>About half of adult mortality rangewide is attributable to human-related causes, primarily watercraft collisions (Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2002). This is significant because the manatee population growth rate is highly sensitive to changes in adult survival rate (Eberhardt and O’Shea 1995, Marmontel <em>et al</em>. 1997, Runge <em>et al</em>. 2004). The future of the Florida manatee is also jeopardized by the predicted loss and deterioration of warm-water habitat, including retirement or deregulation of aging power plants and reduction in natural spring flows.<br/><br/>Watercraft collisions:  Watercraft collisions account for approximately 25% of all manatee deaths and 35% of documented deaths of known cause, and are the single greatest cause of human-related mortality (Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995, FWC-FWRI unpubl.). In 2005, there were over one million registered vessels in Florida (FHSMV, http://casey.hsmv.state.fl.us/Intranet/dmv/TaxCollDocs/vesselstats2005.pdf), and many more out-of-state boaters visit Florida annually. The number of registered vessels in Florida has increased by an average of 2.9% per year over the past 25 years, doubling since 1980 (FWC, unpubl.). Given that about 97% of registrations are for recreational watercraft (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995), it can be expected that there will be a continued increase in recreational vessels plying the waterways of Florida with a concomitant increase in the human population. In addition to the expected increase in boat numbers over the coming century, there are other factors that may act synergistically to increase the risk of collisions between manatees and watercraft. Modifications to the design of vessel hulls and engines are allowing boats to travel at higher speeds in shallower waters (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995), thus threatening manatees and scarring seagrass beds. Boater compliance with existing slow speed zones is inconsistent (Gorzelany 1998, Shapiro 2001). <br/><br/>Sub-lethal effects on manatees of increased vessel traffic and a growing human population in the coastal zone are cause for concern.  Most adult manatee carcasses bear scars from previous boat strikes and the healed, skeletal fractures of some indicate that they had survived previous traumatic impacts (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995, Lightsey <em>et al</em>. 2006). Of over 1,000 living individuals in the manatee photo-identification database (Beck and Reid 1995), 97% had scar patterns from multiple boat strikes (O’Shea <em>et al</em>. 2001). Approximately one-third of these individuals were severely mutilated, especially on the tail and the dorsum. It should be noted that the photo-identification database contains only animals with scars or other identifiable features. Non-lethal injuries may reduce the breeding success of wounded females and may permanently remove some animals from the breeding population (O’Shea 1995, Reynolds 1999). Vessel traffic and recreational activities that disturb manatees may cause them to leave preferred habitats and may alter biologically important behaviours such as feeding, suckling, or resting (O’Shea 1995, Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Loss of Warm-water Habitat:  Expected changes in the network of warm-water refuges over the next several decades present the most serious long-term threat to manatees in Florida, as noted in the federal Recovery Plan: “one of the greatest threats to the continued existence of the Florida manatee is the stability and longevity of warm-water refuges” (USFWS 2001, p. 28). Ultimately, the discharges from power plants provide unreliable warm-water habitat when viewed over the long term (i.e., next 20 to 100 years) because the once-through cooling technology that creates the large thermal plumes is being replaced by more efficient and alternative cooling technologies (Laist and Reynolds 2005a). Short-term threats to the network of warm-water sites also loom on the immediate horizon.  Some aging power plants may be shut down and potential deregulation of the electric utility industry may eliminate or reduce the reliability of warm-water effluents that large numbers of manatees depend on to survive winter cold periods (Rose 1997, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2000). Temporary disruptions in heated effluents during winter have caused changes in local manatee distribution (Packard <em>et al</em>. 1989) and have been implicated in elevated numbers of deaths from cold stress (Campbell and Irvine 1981, Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995). The complete elimination of a secondary warm-water refuge in northeastern Florida through diffusion of the heated effluent resulted in a shift in manatee distribution within the area and in substantial mortality of manatees that remained in the region (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2000, Laist and Reynolds 2005a). Loss of certain key warm-water sites could result in catastrophic mortality and would likely reduce the environmental carrying capacity for manatees in Florida. <br/><br/>The long-term reliability of artesian springs that provide natural warm-water refuges for manatees is also in doubt because human demand for ground water and loss of recharge areas through development will likely result in diminished spring flows (Reynolds 2000, Laist and Reynolds 2005a). According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2001), Florida’s human population increased by about 23% to 16 million between 1990 and 2000, and projections suggest that the number of people living in Florida will increase by another 10 million people by 2025. In order to meet the increased demand for water that a growth in human population will entail, it is likely that spring flows and water quality will decline, further reducing natural warm-water habitat for manatees. This natural habitat will become even more important in the future as existing industrial sites disappear.<br/><br/>Other Direct Threats to Manatees from Human Activities: Other threats from human activities include entanglement (in fishing gear or debris), entrapment in water-control structures and pipes, exposure to contaminants, incidental ingestion of debris, and crushing (in flood-control structures, in canal locks, or between large ships and docks) (Beck and Barros 1991, Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995). Indirect effects from increased vessel traffic include increased water turbidity from wake action and scarring of seagrass beds by propellers (Sargent <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Indirect Threats to Manatees from Human Activities: There is no commercial or subsistence utilization in the USA. However, manatees have become the centre of a large ecotourism industry at certain winter aggregation sites, such as Crystal River. Tens of thousands of people visit these areas to observe and swim with manatees. No-entry sanctuaries provide manatees with havens to avoid swimmers and boats at these sites. Manatees do, in fact, increase their use of these sanctuaries when more boats and swimmers are present (Buckingham <em>et al</em>. 1999, King and Heinen 2004). Manatees also have been found to alter their behaviour in response to the presence of human swimmers, including decreased resting and suckling and increased swimming (King and Heinen 2004).  <br/><br/>The tremendous growth in the human population in coastal Florida over the past half century has resulted in drastic losses of coastal wetland habitats. Seagrass distribution and abundance in many estuaries have declined as the result of direct human impacts (dredging and propeller scarring) and indirect effects of development (declining water quality and nutrient loading). Within Tampa Bay, for example, an estimated 80% of the seagrass present in the early 1900s was lost by 1980 (Kurz <em>et al</em>. 2000). This decline in seagrass coverage is slowly being reversed through actions to reduce nitrogen loading in the regional watershed, which have improved water clarity in much of Tampa Bay (Johansson and Greening 2000, Kurz <em>et al</em>. 2000). Non-point-source runoff is difficult to control, however, so water clarity declines in years of above-average precipitation. Reductions in optical water clarity cause declines in the health and abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (Stevenson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Indirect effects from increased vessel traffic include increased water turbidity from wake action and scarring of seagrass beds by propellers (Sargent <em>et al</em>. 1995). It will be particularly important to protect, restore, and maintain aquatic vegetation communities in the vicinity of warm-water aggregation sites. Without conservation measures to secure these winter habitats, manatees would have to travel greater distances, concentrate into smaller areas, and forage in sub-optimal environments.<br/><br/><strong>Natural Threats</strong><br/>Naturally-occurring catastrophic threats to manatees include prolonged periods of very cold temperatures, hurricanes, harmful algal blooms (i.e., “red tide”), and the potential for a disease epizootic. The threat from extended periods of cold weather relates to the availability and quality of warm-water habitat, which has already been discussed above.  <br/><br/>Hurricanes:  Hurricanes are another type of weather-related phenomenon that can potentially impact manatee populations. In the Northwest subpopulation, Langtimm and Beck (2003) found that adult survival rate was depressed in years with severe storms or hurricanes. The mechanism(s) underlying the lower survival probabilities are unknown, as there has not been a corresponding elevation in the number of reported carcasses. Such events could also result in large-scale emigration out of the affected region. In eastern Australia, for example, the simultaneous occurrence of flooding and a cyclone, combined with poor watershed management practices, resulted in the loss of 1,000 km² of seagrass beds and in the mass movement and mortality of dugongs (<em>Dugong dugong</em>; Preen and Marsh 1995). Given the notice from meteorologists that we have entered a new 25- to 50-year cycle of greater hurricane activity and intensity (Landsea <em>et al</em>. 1996), as well as possible longer-term changes associated with global climate change (McCarthy <em>et al</em>. 2001), storm activity may have a greater impact on manatee populations in the future.  <br/><br/>Red Tide: Manatees on Florida’s Gulf coast are frequently exposed to brevetoxin, a potent neurotoxin produced by the dinoflagellate <em>Karenia brevis</em> during red tide events. In 1996, 151 manatees were confirmed or suspected to have died in southwestern Florida from brevetoxicosis (Landsberg and Steidinger 1998, Bossart <em>et al</em>. 1998). This epizootic was particularly detrimental to the manatee population because more adults were killed than any other age class. Other red tide mortality events in 1982, 2002, 2003, and 2005 resulted in the confirmed red tide-related deaths of 37, 33, 86, and 68 manatees, respectively, with an additional 35 carcasses suspected to have died from red tide during those years (O’Shea <em>et al</em>. 1991; FWC unpubl.). Recent studies have determined that brevetoxin can exist outside of the algal cells (e.g., on seagrass) for extended periods of time, thus further increasing the threat to foraging manatees (Flewelling <em>et al</em>. 2005). Red tide represents a major natural source of mortality for manatees in the southwest region. There is no clear evidence that these events have been increasing in frequency along Florida’s coast, but certainly the impact on the manatee population has increased over the past two decades. The role of nutrient loading to coastal systems relative to the intensity and duration of inshore red tides is an active area of research for the FWRI harmful algal blooms group.<br/><br/>Pathogens: Manatees could potentially be exposed to pathogens. Spread of such pathogens could be particularly rapid during winter when manatees are concentrated in warm-water refuges. Large-scale mortality events caused by disease or toxins have decimated other populations of marine mammals, including seals and dolphins, removing 50% or more of the individuals in some events (Harwood and Hall 1990). Manatees have robust immune systems that have, through the present time, provided disease resistance. Since 1997 papilloma virus has been found in captive Florida manatees and there is some evidence that it may also be present in the wild population in northwest Florida (Bossart <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Woodruff <em>et al</em>. 2005). While the consensus is that this virus probably does not present a serious threat to manatees at this time, managers are proceeding cautiously (e.g., by establishing a quarantine on exposed captives) and surveillance for papilloma lesions in wild manatees continues.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>Major threats to survival of the Antillean manatee include habitat degradation and loss, hunting, incidental catch/accidental take, watercraft collisions, entanglement in fishing gear, pollution, natural disasters, and human disturbance. Although threats due to hunting are diminishing in some areas, all other threats are increasing in most areas. Illegal hunting for subsistence and profit was reported as a significant threat in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.  Pollution from agriculture and mining was consistently noted in reports from South American countries. Intrinsic factors that limit the population’s ability to withstand these anthropogenic impacts include low fecundity, slow growth, limited dispersal, and restricted range.<br/><br/>Of particular note were: (1) In Belize, watercraft related mortality was reported as the major threat, followed by illegal hunting and entanglement in fishing gear; and (2) In north-eastern Brazil, the stranding of live-orphaned calves was identified as the main recent threat to the species (Parente <em>et al</em>. 2004). Between 1981 and 2002, 74 stranded manatees were reported on the north-eastern coast of Brazil with 58% (n=43) being live dependent calves. This high percentage suggested that that the main threat may be human disturbance resulting in mother-calf separation. Disturbance in the area is due to shrimp farms, salt farms, a general increase in human activities in the coastal zone, and uncontrolled tourism. Additional major threats include hunting, entanglement in fishing nets, watercraft collisions, indiscriminate development of the coast, and degradation of aquatic environments.","<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) recently conducted two Biological Status Reviews of the Florida manatee that involved comprehensive compilation and synthesis of population and range data, along with extensive modeling of population projections (FWC 2002, 2003; Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). In addition, the Manatee Population Status Working Group of the Florida Manatee Recovery and Implementation Team has produced a comprehensive Biological Population Assessment (MPSWG 2005).<br/><br/>There are no statistically based estimates (with variance) of abundance for the entire Florida manatee population. The minimum documented abundance is determined from range-wide synoptic surveys which have been conducted nearly every winter since 1991. The surveys are timed to coincide with periods of extreme cold weather when manatees aggregate at a limited number of warm-water sites. The highest count obtained during these surveys was 3,300 manatees in January 2001 (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006); this is presumed to be a minimum count, but the fraction detected is unknown. Based on the assumption of a stable age distribution, and estimating proportion mature to be 0.70 from the core biological population model, the estimated number of mature individuals in the population is 2,310. Because detection probability varies greatly with weather conditions and across sites, population experts have consistently cautioned against using these data for trend analyses.<br/><br/>Long-term studies of the Florida manatee indicate that there are four relatively distinct regional subpopulations, as recognized in the Florida Manatee Recovery Plan (USFWS 2001). Each subpopulation comprises individuals that tend to return to the same warm-water refuges each winter and have similar non-winter distribution patterns. Exchange of individuals among subpopulations is considered to be relatively limited, based on data from telemetry (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003) and photo-identification (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, FWC and USGS, unpubl.). The four subpopulations differ in abundance, demographic rates, habitats, and major threats. What follows is a summary of our understanding of their rates of population growth over the past decade and very brief statements on the status of each subpopulation. Minimum population sizes are provided by the high synoptic survey count of 5 to 6 January 2001 (FWC unpubl.). Population growth rates cited below were estimated by Runge and colleagues (2004) using a stage-based model that integrated mark-recapture estimates of survival and reproduction (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2004, Langtimm <em>et al</em>. 2004). The estimates of vital rates were made possible through a long-term, multi-agency effort to photographically identify individual manatees based on their distinct patterns of scars and mutilations (Beck and Reid 1995).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Atlantic Coast subpopulation extends along the entire east coast of Florida (including the Florida Keys and Florida Bay), coastal states northward along the Atlantic seaboard, and the lower St. Johns River north of Palatka. A total of 1,444 manatees were counted in the Atlantic region during the 2001 synoptic survey. Craig and Reynolds (2004) estimated that the population size of manatees using power plants on the Atlantic Coast during winter 2001 was 1,607 (95% Bayesian credible interval: 1,353 to 1,972). Over the most recent 10-year period, Runge <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated that the Atlantic subpopulation had grown at an annual rate of 1.0% per year (95% CI: -1.2 to 2.9%), but this was not statistically different from zero. The subpopulation may have increased slowly or it may have declined slightly over this time period. Craig and Reynolds (2004) used a Bayesian approach to model growth in aerial counts of manatees at several major aggregation sites along the Atlantic coast (primarily power plants). This model took into account manatee movement between surveys and variation in detection rates with ambient temperature. The trends in counts suggest the population of animals using Atlantic power plants increased at a rate of 5 to 7% per year from 1982 to 1989, leveled off (growth rate 0 to 4%yr<sup>-1</sup>) between 1990 and 1993, and has been increasing at about 4 to 6% per year since 1994. The discrepancy in growth rates of these two modeling approaches needs further investigation to provide a better understanding of population trends along the Atlantic coast.<br/> <br/><strong>Upper St. Johns River Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Upper St. Johns River subpopulation occurs in a much smaller area in the river south of Palatka. A total of 112 manatees were counted during the 2001 synoptic survey, but intensive observations that facilitate identification of nearly every individual using Blue Spring, the main overwintering site in the region, indicate that at least 141 different manatees visited the spring during that winter. A total of 190 manatees were counted at Blue Spring during a synoptic survey in 2006. The subpopulation occupying the Upper St. Johns River has shown strong growth over the past decade, increasing at an annual rate of 6.2% (95% CI: 3.7 to 8.1%) based on the stage-based model. This growth rate is supported by high survival and reproductive rates. This is the smallest of the four subpopulations, contributing less than 5% to the maximum synoptic count, but it is growing the fastest.<br/><br/><strong>Northwest Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Northwest subpopulation extends from the Pasco-Hernando County line along the central Gulf coast northward through the Florida Panhandle and including the coastal areas of adjoining states at least as far as Louisiana. A total of 377 manatees were counted in the Northwest region during the 2001 synoptic survey.  This subpopulation has grown at an annual rate of 3.7% (95% CI: 1.6 to 5.6%) over the past 10 years. This is the second smallest subpopulation, accounting for about 11% of the highest synoptic count. Its dynamics are similar to those of the USJ, with a high adult survival rate, except reproduction seems to be lower.<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Southwest subpopulation extends from the Pasco-Hernando County line (north of Tampa) southward to Whitewater Bay (part of Everglades National Park) in Monroe County. Minimum subpopulation size from the high synoptic survey count in 2001 was 1,367 individuals for the Southwest region. This subpopulation has declined at an estimated rate of -1.1% per year (95% CI: -5.4 to +2.4%) over the most recent eight-year period. The relatively wide confidence interval reflects greater uncertainty about survival and reproductive rates in this region, in part due to a shorter time series of sight-resight data. Estimates of adult survival are lower than those of all other subpopulations, probably due to the combined effects of chronic human-related (watercraft) mortality and episodic mortality events caused by red tide. It should also be noted that manatees in the Southwest subpopulation are found in a broad diversity of habitats from the more developed Tampa Bay to the more pristine reaches of Everglades National Park; demographic data are lacking for individuals in the southernmost parts of the region. Temporary emigration outside of the study areas may result in a downward bias in survival rates.<br/><br/>FWC has a wide-reaching manatee carcass salvage and necropsy programme that recovers nearly every dead manatee reported in the state of Florida. Consequently, we have a long time series of excellent data on causes of death. In all of the four subpopulations, adult mortality is mostly attributable to human-related causes, primarily watercraft collisions. However, because of the lower survival rates in the Atlantic and Southwest subpopulations, the impact of this anthropogenic mortality on population growth is much greater than in the other two regions. For the immature age class, perinatal mortality is the most common “cause” and watercraft collisions is the next highest known cause of death for all subpopulations (see Major Threats).<br/><br/>It is clear that the two smallest subpopulations have been growing over the past decade, while the two largest subpopulations have grown slightly, not at all, or may be declining. Available data suggest that the Southwest subpopulation is in decline. One way to estimate the overall growth rate for the Florida manatee is to take an average of the four subpopulation's growth rates, weighted by relative size. This yields a point estimate of 0.6% per year. Confidence intervals do not incorporate our uncertainty in the relative sizes of the subpopulations. That is, this point estimate assumes that the sighting detection rate in the synoptic survey was the same in each region in 2001, which is very unlikely, and that weights have remained constant over time. So, while the available data suggest that the point estimate of population growth for this subspecies may be close to zero or slightly positive, the associated uncertainty means that the population could be declining or increasing slightly.  <br/><br/>Population Projections:  FWC used population viability analysis models to address the three criteria that involved the probability of future population decline or extinction (FWC 2002, 2003; Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). The models were based on vital rate estimates for each of four subpopulations and they incorporated demographic and environmental stochasticity. The models simulated scenarios based on plausible future threats to manatees and their habitat, including expected declines in carrying capacity through loss of warm-water refugia (loss of power plant discharges, declines in spring flow), potential increases in mortality (mostly due to watercraft collisions) associated with projected human population growth, and natural catastrophic mortality events (red tide, cold, disease). The outcome of the most recent PVA model was that there is a 12.1% chance of a 50% decline in the next three generations (generation time estimated between 16.8 and 22.6 years), and a 55.5% chance of a 20% reduction in the next two generations (Criterion C1) (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). For details, peer reviews, and a fuller discussion of these results, assumptions, limitations, and conclusions, please see the FWC’s Biological Status Reviews of the Florida manatee.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>There are no statistically derived population estimates for <em>T. m. manatus</em> within its range, which historically covers 41 countries in the Wider Caribbean Region. Peer-reviewed publications are sparse, but there has been a significant increase in research on Antillean manatees over the past 10 years, resulting in many theses, presentations at regional meetings, local reports, and adoption of management plans. <br/><br/>We compiled data gathered through an extensive literature review and personal communication with 45 scientists representing expertise in 29 countries, but exclusive of the Florida manatee population (which was assessed independently). Antillean manatee populations occur in 20 of the 37 countries assessed, with sightings of vagrants in additional countries. However, distribution is not continuous and populations are patchy and fragmented. Using these documents, supplemented by the questionnaires completed by local experts, we derived a very rough minimum population estimate for the subspecies. Our confidence in population estimates varies dramatically from country to country, depending on the nature and extent of recent research efforts. For that reason, we used orders of magnitude in an effort to establish some baseline population estimates for each of the 20 countries where populations are most probably extant and viable. Although the quality and quantity of data vary from country to country, there is consistency regarding a continuing decline in both manatees and the quality and quantity of available habitat.  <br/><br/>Estimates by country, based on the best available data, range from less than 10 up to ~1,000 total animals, with the largest populations reported from Mexico and Belize (Table 1). No country reports an increasing country-wide population (except Bahamas with less than 10 animals). All publications and personal communications indicate country-wide populations are declining, stable, or unknown. In a few countries, localized populations may be increasing; in most countries, reports indicate a significant decline over the past 30-50 years, but this is based solely on anecdotal evidence and/or interviews with local people. <br/><br/>While the data in Table 1 suggest that approximately 2,600 individuals exist, scattered widely through the Caribbean region, optimistic ""estimates"" of the size of the manatee population (also based on interviews with experts in different countries, and not necessarily on empirical data) suggest that it may actually be in the range of 5,600 individuals. The age structure of the various manatee subpopulations of <em>T. m. manatus</em> is unknown, but the percentage of mature animals in Florida was estimated to be 70% through population modeling (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006) and 46% through carcass recovery (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Marmontel 1995, Marmontel <em>et al</em>. 1997). The figure based on carcasses is biased low due to the presence of a large proportion of calves in the sample. We note that hunting and other threats in the Caribbean may lead to a very different age structure for <em>T. m. manatus</em> than for <em>T. m. latirostris</em>; in fact, if hunters target large (i.e., mature) manatees, the percentage of mature individuals for <em>T. m. manatus</em> could be substantially lower than is the case for <em>T. m. latirostris</em>. Therefore, we consider that the percentage of mature individuals for the Antillean subspecies is likely to lie somewhere between 46% and 70%. <br/><br/>Based on the above information, we feel it is likely that the actual population size is intermediate between the number counted (2,600; minimum population size) and the more optimistic suggestions (5,600); an average between those two numbers would place the actual population size at approximately 4,100 manatees. Using this average value, and the two percentages given above for mature animals, the number of mature individuals would therefore lie between 1,886 and 2,870. Selecting the average value between these numbers produces an estimate of 2,378 mature individuals. While we do not place much significance in these average values, it is reasonable to conclude - based on the available evidence and taking the precautionary approach - that the overall number of mature individuals in this subspecies is likely to be less the 2,500.",Decreasing,"Florida manatees (<em>T. m. latirostris</em>) are found only in the United States, although a few vagrants have been known to reach the Bahamas. Their year-round distribution is restricted to peninsular Florida because they need warm water to survive the winter. During the non-winter months (March to November), some manatees disperse to adjoining states. Along the Atlantic coast these states include Georgia (highest manatee use outside of Florida), South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia; one satellite-tagged manatee traveled as far north as Rhode Island (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003), and another manatee was observed in New York (Long Island). Along the Gulf coast west of Florida, manatees are occasionally sighted in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The source (Florida or Mexico) of the Texas manatees is not always clear, but the weight of recent genetic and other evidence suggests most are from the Florida subspecies. Major freshwater bodies utilized by manatees in Florida include Lake Okeechobee, St. Johns River, Suwannee River, Caloosahatchee River, among others.<br/><br/>During the warm season (March or April through October or November, depending on latitude and year), manatees disperse throughout the coastal waters, estuaries, and major rivers of Florida and some migrate to neighboring states, particularly south-eastern Georgia. Their range constricts dramatically in the winter season (December to February) when manatees seek shelter from the cold at a limited number of warm-water sites or areas in the southern two-thirds of Florida. These sites include 10 principal power plant thermal outfalls (seven on the Atlantic coast, three on the Gulf coast) and four major artesian springs (Blue Spring, springs at the head of Crystal River, Homosassa Spring, and Warm Mineral Spring) that are frequented by a large proportion of the manatee population during winter.<br/><br/>The Antillean Manatee (<em>T. m. manatus</em>) inhabits riverine and coastal systems in the tropical and subtropical Western Atlantic Coastal Zone from the Bahamas to Brazil, including the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Although at least one individual in the Bahamas is a known migrant from Florida (Reid 2000, 2001), the Bahamas is detailed in this <em>T. m. manatus</em> assessment rather than the <em>T. m. latirostris</em> assessment. During the past decade, populations have been confirmed in the coastal waters and/or rivers of at least 19 of the 37 countries with historical records (Table 1); a population may be extant in Haiti (Ottenwalder 1995), although in very reduced numbers if at all. Rare sightings, categorized as vagrants, have been documented in five additional countries (Debrot Gore pers. comm).<br/><br/>See the Supplementary Material&#160;for Table 1: Summary of reported data by country for extant manatee populations.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>The following text was excerpted directly from the Florida Manatee Recovery Plan (USFWS 2001), with condensation and some minor revisions from the assessors. The state of Florida’s Manatee Management Plan is due to be completed by June 2007 and will provide further details of planned management and conservation actions.  <br/><br/><strong>Efforts to Reduce Watercraft-Related Injuries and Deaths</strong><br/>The largest identified cause of manatee death is collisions with watercraft. Many living manatees also bear scars or wounds from vessel strikes. Because watercraft operators cannot reliably detect and avoid hitting manatees, federal and state managers have sought to limit watercraft speed in areas where manatees are most likely to occur to afford both manatees and boaters time to avoid collisions. In 1989, the Florida Governor and Cabinet approved a series of recommendations by the former FDNR to improve protection of manatees in 13 key counties. Since then state and local governments have cooperated in the creation and implementation of county Manatee Protection Plans and county-wide manatee protection speed zone rules. Two types of manatee protection areas also have been developed by FWS: (1) manatee sanctuaries, areas in which all waterborne activities are prohibited; and (2) manatee refuges areas where certain waterborne activities are restricted or prohibited. FWS and FWC continue to evaluate needs for additional protection areas that may be necessary to achieve recovery. The goal is to consider the needs of the manatee at an ecosystem level and to establish regulations to ensure that adequate protected areas are available throughout Florida to satisfy habitat requirements of the Florida manatee population with a view toward recovery.<br/><br/>In recent years, both the FWS and FWC have been using targeted enforcement strategies in an attempt to increase boater compliance with speed zones and ultimately reduce manatee injuries and death. FWS’ strategy has been to allocate significant enforcement manpower to specific areas on designated weekends. These enforcement teams travel to various locations around the state, with particular emphasis given to those zones within counties where there is a history of high watercraft-caused manatee deaths. FWC has increased its emphasis on enforcement and compliance with manatee speed zones by adding new officers, conducting law enforcement task force initiatives, increasing overtime, and increasing the proportion of law enforcement time devoted to manatee conservation.<br/><br/>Managers, researchers, and the boating industry have investigated the use of various devices to aid in the reduction of watercraft-related manatee deaths. For example, the State of Florida funded an evaluation of propeller guards (Milligan and Tennant 1998). The state’s evaluation concluded that these devices would reduce cutting damage associated with propellers when boats were operating at low speeds. However, when boats (including boats equipped with propeller guards) operate at high speeds, guards would be of little benefit because animals would continue to be killed by blunt trauma associated with impacts from boat hulls, lower units, and other gear. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) identified additional concerns, stating that propeller guards on small recreational vessels “may create more problems than they solve” and does not support their use on recreational vessels at this time (Carmichael 2001). There are propeller guard applications, however, that appear to work for certain large, commercial vessels; for example, the use of guards on C-tractor tugs has eliminated this specific source of manatee mortality at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in St. Marys, Georgia. To prevent injuries to manatees, propeller guards are used on some rental and sight-seeing boats at Blue Spring and Crystal River.<br/><br/>Researchers have also begun to investigate the manatees’ acoustic environment to better evaluate the animal’s response to vessel traffic. This line of research needs to be thoroughly assessed for its potential as another management tool to minimize collisions between manatees and boats. Results from Gerstein <em>et al</em>. (1999) indicate that manatees hear in the range from 500 Hz to 46 kHz and that inadequate hearing sensitivity at low frequencies may be a contributing factor to the manatees’ ability to effectively detect boat noise to avoid collisions. One technology often discussed is an acoustic deterrence device mounted on a boat.  Conceptually, this technological approach may sound like an answer to the manatee/watercraft issue. A number of problems have been defined with the use of acoustic deterrents. No alarm/warning device has yet been demonstrated to adequately protect wildlife or marine mammals. Additionally, concern has also been stated regarding the increase in background noise that these deterrents would add to an already noisy marine environment. It has not been determined what negative impacts this device would have on marine life and what effects it would have on animals that use acoustic cues for a variety of purposes. For these reasons, this technology needs to be thoroughly researched and assessed and managers need to evaluate the MMPA and ESA “take” issues related to implementing such technology.<br/><br/>Current research into the sensory capabilities of manatees is being supported at both the state and federal levels. One study assessed the effects of boat noise in a more controlled environment, by recording the physical and acoustic reaction of a manatee to a pre-determined acoustical level. This study design will allow the development of a relationship between acoustic amplitude and behavioural responses. Another study examined acoustical propagation over various types of marine topography. In cooperation with Mote Marine Laboratory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the FWC is also examining manatee behavioural response to watercraft using new technology, the DTAG, a digital acoustic tag which records acoustic attributes of the environment and detailed manatee movement simultaneously. A study to assess manatee behaviours in the presence of fishing gear and their response to novelty and the potential for reducing gear interactions also has an acoustic component. The FWC is also supporting the development and implementation of technological solutions for reducing the risks that watercraft pose to manatees. <br/><br/>Additional priority actions to better protect manatees include boater education, maintenance of signs and buoys, compliance assessment, and periodic re-evaluation of the effectiveness of the rules. Such work requires close cooperation between FWC Imperiled Species Management, FWC’s Division of Law Enforcement, county officials, the Inland Navigation Districts, FWS, USCG, and, of course, boaters.<br/><br/><strong>Efforts to Reduce Flood Gate and Navigation Lock Deaths</strong><br/>Entrapment in water-control structures and navigational locks is the second largest cause of human-related manatee deaths. In some cases, manatees appear to have been crushed in closing gates; in others, they may have been drowned after being pinned against narrow gate openings by water currents. Water-control structures implicated in manatee deaths in Dade and Broward counties are operated by the South Florida WMD. From 1976 through 2000, 166 manatees have been killed in water control structures in Dade County alone, accounting for 33% of all manatee deaths in this county. In the early 1980s, steps were taken to modify gate-opening procedures to ensure openings were wide enough to allow a manatee to pass through unharmed. Steps were also initiated to fence off openings and cavities in gate structures where manatees might become trapped. Manatee deaths subsequently declined and remained low for much of that decade. Much progress has been made toward identifying, testing, and installing manatee protection devices (e.g., pressure sensors) at water control structures. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) has also installed removable barriers on the upstream side of the Ortona and St. Lucie Lock spillway structures. The large difference in the upstream and downstream water levels at these structures compromises the effectiveness and use of pressure sensor devices. Locks frequented by manatees have been retrofitted with an acoustic array on the gates; this device detects the presence of a manatee during lock closing to avoid pinning or crushing. An interagency task force, established in 1991, continues to monitor, examine and make recommendations to protect manatees at water control structures and navigational locks.<br/><br/><strong>Habitat Protection</strong><br/>Intensive coastal development throughout Florida poses a long-term threat to the Florida manatee. There are three major approaches to address this problem. First, FWS, FWC, Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GDNR), and other recovery partners review and comment on applications for federal and state permits for construction projects in manatee habitat areas and to minimize their impacts. Under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, FWS annually reviews hundreds of permit applications to the ACOE for construction projects in waters and wetlands that include or are adjacent to important manatee habitat. FWC and GDNR provide similar reviews to their respective state’s environmental permitting programs.<br/><br/>A second approach is the development of county manatee protection plans. The provisions of these plans are implemented through amendments to local growth management plans under the Florida’s Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act of 1985. In addition to boat speed rules, manatee protection plans are to include boat facility siting policies and other measures to protect manatees and their habitat.<br/><br/>A third approach to habitat protection is land acquisition. Both FWS and the State of Florida have taken steps to acquire and add new areas containing important manatee habitat to federal and state protected area systems. The State of Florida has acquired important areas through several programs, most notably the Florida Forever Program. In Florida, the Governor and Cabinet have included special consideration for purchase of lands that can be of benefit to manatees and their habitat. Over $500 million has been spent to acquire 250,000 acres, whose importance included, but was by no means limited to, protection of manatee habitat. FWS has also acquired and now manages thousands of acres of land important to manatees and many other species in the NWR System. In addition to these efforts, FWS’s initiative to propose new manatee refuges and sanctuaries factors into habitat protection. Both the State of Florida and FWS are continuing cooperative efforts with a view towards establishing a network of important manatee habitats throughout Florida.<br/><br/><strong>Manatee Rescue, Rehabilitation and Release</strong><br/>Thousands of reports of distressed manatees purportedly in need of assistance have been made to the state wildlife enforcement offices and other resource protection agencies by a concerned public. While most of the manatees do not require assistance, dozens of manatees are rescued and treated each year. A network of state and local agencies and private organizations, coordinated by FWS, has been rescuing and treating these animals for well over 20 years.<br/><br/>Manatees are brought into captivity when stressed by cold weather, when struck and injured by watercraft, when injured because of entanglements in crab traps and monofilament fishing line, when orphaned, and when compromised by other natural and man-made factors. Programme veterinarians and staff have developed treatments and protocols for these animals and have been remarkably successful in their efforts to rehabilitate compromised individuals. Since 1973, over 180 manatees have been treated and returned to the wild (FWS unpubl.).<br/><br/>Media coverage of manatee rescues, treatments, and releases helps to educate millions of people about manatees, the life-threatening problems that they face, and actions that can be taken to minimize the effect of anthropogenic activities on this species. In addition, more than 18 million visitors a year see manatees at rehabilitation facilities and participate in manatee education programs sponsored by several parks. The publicity and outreach inherent in this program provide significant support to efforts to recover the manatee.<br/><br/><strong>Public Education, Awareness, and Support</strong><br/>Government agencies, industries, oceanaria and environmental groups have all contributed to manatee public awareness and education efforts that were initiated in the 1970s. These efforts have expanded in scope and increased in quantity since that time. Some key counties in Florida have also started the education component of their manatee protection plans. These public awareness and education efforts encourage informed public participation in regulatory and other management decision-making processes and provide constructive avenues for private funding of state manatee recovery programs, research, and land acquisition efforts through programmes such as the specialty automobile license tag for manatees.<br/><br/>The public has been made aware of new information on the biology and status of manatees, urgent conservation issues, and the regulations and measures required to assure their protection through the production of brochures, posters, films and videos, press releases, public service announcements and advertisements, and other media-oriented materials. Outdoor signs have been produced that provide general manatee information and highlight the problems associated with feeding manatees.<br/><br/>Manatee viewing opportunities have also been made available to the public. In addition, volunteers from several organizations annually give presentations to schools and other groups and distribute educational materials at festivals and events. Such efforts are essential for obtaining public compliance with conservation measures to protect manatees and their habitats.<br/><br/>Many public awareness materials have been developed specifically focusing on boater education. Public awareness waterway signs are produced and distributed alerting boaters to the presence of manatees. Brochures, boat decals, boater’s guides, and other materials with manatee protection tips and boating safety information have been produced and are distributed by law enforcement groups, through marinas, and boating safety classes. Educational kiosks have been designed and installed at marinas, boat ramps, and other waterfront locations. Monofilament fishing line collection sites and cleanup efforts are being established.  Several agencies and organizations provide educator’s guides, posters, and coloring and activity books to teachers in Florida and across the United States. In addition, Save The Manatee Club (SMC) and FWC Advisory Council on Environmental Education have produced a video for distribution to schools throughout Florida and the United States.

Agencies and organizations help to educate law enforcement personnel about manatees and inform them about available outreach materials that can be distributed to user groups.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>Conservation of the Antillean manatee at the regional level has been driven by the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (Freestone 1991), resulting in the Regional Management Plan for the West Indian Manatee, <em>Trichechus manatus</em> (UNEP 1995).

13036599,223,Acipenser fulvescens,Least Concern,,2004,2004-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Acipenser fulvescens</em> was assessed by the IUCN SSC Sturgeon Specialist Group in 1996 as Vulnerable. A more detailed look at the data available for this species has resulted in it being downgraded to Least Concern. <br/> <br/>The lake sturgeon occupies the United States and Canadian waters of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River basin; Lake Champlain (Vermont-New York); the Lake Winnebago-Fox River complex (Wisconsin); Canada’s Hudson and James Bay watersheds; the Saskatchewan River (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba); and the Mississippi River basin area from the headwaters in Minnesota to the northern portion of the state of Louisiana and up the Missouri River into southern South Dakota. Well-regulated sport fisheries occur throughout the northern part of the range and Canada manages modest commercial fisheries in Ontario and Quebec provinces.  <br/> <br/>Although very little stock assessment is underway, the lake sturgeon subpopulation in the Mississippi and lower Missouri river basins is believed to be stable but relatively small, certainly compared to levels in the late 1800s prior to development of modern locks, dams and reservoirs. Area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and quality of habitats in this part of the species’ range are all diminished compared to historic conditions.  Restocking efforts using cultured fish are modest and fragmented among the states but results from Missouri DOC stockings are encouraging. Since there is currently no concerted basin-wide or interstate plan to manage or restore this stock, the Mississippi river basin lake sturgeon subpopulation is considered to be Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>The largest proportion of the global population lies in the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River basin areas where numerous management and recovery plans are in place among and between states and provinces sharing boundary waters. Most threats here are understood and essential conservation measures are being implemented. Populations of lake sturgeon are being monitored and assessed and most segments of the stock appear to be increasing. Based upon all of the above information and IUCN definitions, the species currently is not facing a threat to its survival and is categorized as Least Concern (LC).","Based on pectoral fin ray sections it has been determined that lake sturgeon can live to be over 100 years old. One individual caught in Lake of the Woods, Ontario in 1953 was estimated to be 152 years old (Priegel and Wirth 1971). Lake sturgeon can reach lengths of 1.9 m, and weigh 91 kg. However, a 141 kg lake sturgeon was reportedly caught in Lake Superior in 1922 and a fish of equal weight was caught in Lake Michigan in 1943. Most fish reported in the literature were less than 35 years old.
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon from Black Lake in Michigan measured 75–193 cm total length (TL) and were 9–64 years old, with most fish less than 20 years old (Baker and Borgeson 1999). In the Lake Winnebago system of Wisconsin, female lake sturgeon reach sexual maturity between 24–26 years of age when they are about 140 cm long. Females spawn only every 3–6 years and can produce up to 700,000 eggs each time. Few male lake sturgeon mature before they are 114 cm long or 14–16 years old. Males spawn every one or two years (Priegel and Wirth 1971, Lyons and Kempinger 1992). In the Sturgeon River of Upper Michigan, male spawning intervals of two, three and four years were observed while females returned to spawn every three to seven years (Auer 1999). In Canadian rivers and lakes, mature male lake sturgeon range in size from 76–98 cm and females 84–117 cm (Houston 1987). Compared to sturgeon from Lake Winnebago and the Great Lakes, relatively little information is available regarding age, growth, maturity and spawning periodicity of lake sturgeon in the Mississippi River basin.
<br/>
<br/>During the spring season, lake sturgeon spawning occurs when water temperatures rise and reach 9–15 °C (Priegel and Wirth 1971, Kempinger 1988).  Spawning sturgeon will select shallow areas over hard clean substrate with relatively strong current velocities (Kempinger 1988).
<br/>
<br/>Usual lake sturgeon habitat is the highly productive shoal areas of larger lakes and rivers. They require moderate to swift currents and large rough substrates for spawning and embryo development. Lake sturgeon in the Upper Mississippi River prefer habitat in or adjacent to flow, but with relatively low to moderate current velocity (Knights, B. C., USGS, unpublished data).  They are rarely found in backwater habitats without flow. In the Mississippi basin habitat that is in or adjacent to current is generally depositional and has relatively compact silt or silt-sand substrates with presumed high densities of benthic invertebrates. These areas occur at the lower end of navigation pools near the main channel, the mouths of tributaries and large secondary channels, and at some channel border areas. While migrating, presumably en-route to spawning habitats or high use (feeding/home) areas, lake sturgeon will use areas of the river with relatively high current velocities including tailwaters, the main channel in the upper and mid reaches of navigation pools, and tributaries.
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon are known to move great distances to spawning and feeding habitats (Auer 1996). Wisconsin DNR recently reported that a sturgeon originally tagged in Lake Winnebago in October 1978 was recovered almost 19 years later at Locust Point Reef in Lake Erie, a minimum travel distance of almost 1,100 km (R. Bruch, WI DNR, news release).","The life history characteristics of slow growth, late maturation, and irregular spawning periodicity make lake sturgeon subpopulations particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. Anthropogenic effects such as industrial and municipal pollution, blockage of access to habitats by dykes and dams, channeliszation and elimination of backwater areas, dewatering and water level fluctuations, physical destruction of spawning habitat, and inundation of habitat by reservoirs are known to threaten sturgeon subpopulations (Rochard <em>et al</em>. 1990, Auer 1996, Beamesderfer and Farr 1997, Noakes <em>et al</em>. 1999). Direct mortality of lake sturgeon due to impacts with commercial and/or recreational navigation vessels has been documented.  <br/> <br/>Dams may be the greatest impediment to lake sturgeon rehabilitation in the Great Lakes. Although there are numerous recorded instances of tagged sturgeon passing through navigation locks, many fish are precluded or delayed from reaching spawning or preferred feeding waters. Dams without locks completely block sturgeon passage and serve as severe impediments to lake sturgeon recovery in the Mississippi basin. Spawning and nursery areas are further degraded from land use problems such as erosion, sedimentation, and adverse discharges from point and non-point sources. Other concerns in the Great Lakes include stream channelization, over-exploitation and/or illegal harvest, lack of public concern and potential adverse impacts of lampricides on sensitive life stages.  <br/> <br/>Although lake sturgeon harvest from the Mississippi River is prohibited, financial incentive to collect roe for caviar remains. Small population sizes may limit poachers from targeting this species but it is likely that incidental captures are utilized and end up in the black market. With the first stocking of lake sturgeon by Missouri DOC now at age 17, there is increasing concern that poachers will target them as the females reach maturity within the next few years.","Lake sturgeon were, and in some cases continue to be, an important component of Native American diet and culture. Up until about 1870, lake sturgeon were primarily considered a nuisance by commercial fisherman and were stacked on the shores to rot (Milner 1874 cited in Becker 1983). Within the next 30 years the value of sturgeon for flesh and the use of roe for caviar became economically important. During heavy fishing years in the late 1800s lake sturgeon harvest from the Great Lakes averaged over 1,814 metric tons (mt) per year. In the peak harvest year of 1885, 4,901 mt were reported of which 2,359 tons came from Lake Erie alone. Sturgeon populations declined dramatically after 1900 and although some incidental harvest was reported until 1977, numbers were extremely low after 1956.
<br/>
<br/>Although lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes were greatly reduced due to overfishing during the last several decades of the nineteenth century they appear to be on the rebound throughout the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence basins with spawning populations being documented from 63 locations and spawning size estimates calculated for 17 of these sites.  The current status of lake sturgeon populations in most of the Great Lakes Basin, the St. Lawrence River and in Wisconsin’s Lake Winnebago system is stable or increasing. 
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon were generally considered to be rare to uncommon in most waters of the Mississippi River basin since the late 1800s. In 1989, this species was declared as threatened by the American Fisheries Society in all Mississippi River states except Louisiana where they are believed to be extirpated (Williams <em>et al</em>. 1989). The Department of Natural Resources in Iowa and Illinois and the Missouri Department of Conservation list the lake sturgeon as endangered in their respective states, and in Minnesota, the lake sturgeon is listed as a species of special concern. The species appears to be extirpated from its former range in Alabama and Arkansas.
<br/>
<br/>The current status of lake sturgeon throughout the Mississippi basin is considered to be severely depressed from historical abundance levels. However, modern population assessment studies are lacking and rate of stock decline or growth is unknown. Native stocks were extremely depressed prior to the stocking program undertaken by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Following the first releases into Mark Twain Lake (Salt River, a Pool 24 tributary) in 1984, then at Louisiana on Pool 24 of the Mississippi River and at several Missouri River locations in 1988, increasing reports of incidental catch in commercial gear and by recreational anglers has been occurring.",Increasing,"Lake sturgeon spend their entire life cycle in freshwater and are widely distributed in North America. They currently range throughout much of the drainages of the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, the St. Lawrence River, Hudson Bay-James Bay, and the Saskatchewan River (Pflieger 1975, Becker 1983, Ferguson and Duckworth 1997). In the Mississippi basin this species occurs from the headwaters in Minnesota to the northern portion of the state of Louisiana and up the Missouri River into southern South Dakota. There is no known natural exchange of stocks between the Great Lakes and western Canadian provinces and those of the Mississippi River basin, though some stockings in the Mississippi have included lake sturgeon of Great Lakes Basin origin.  <br/> <br/>For a more detailed description of this species’ range, see <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/"">NatureServe’s Explorer database</a>.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Commercial harvest of lake sturgeon is prohibited in all U.S. waters and strictly managed in Canadian waters with closed seasons, size limits and gear restrictions.  <br/> <br/>Angling in some waters of Michigan is allowed with several restrictions as to season, fish sizes and gear. In Wisconsin, harvest is limited to two separate sportfishing seasons. Spear fishermen must purchase a one-fish sturgeon spear tag and they are allowed to spear a fish from early February until a specified quota is reached. In Lake Winnebago, the 2000 quota was set at 400 adult females, 400 juvenile females and 2,150 males. Once 80% of the quota is reached the fishery is closed after the next day. Typical spear fishing harvest in recent years produced 1,500 to 2,500 fish. Wisconsin’s hook and line fishery allows the catch of one fish per angler per season with a minimum size range of 127–178 cm, depending on location, during early September through 15 October. All anglers must apply for and use a free tag and the fishery produces about 300–400 fish per season.  <br/> <br/>Sport fishing for lake sturgeon is currently prohibited in the Mississippi River but is allowed in some tributaries in Wisconsin and Minnesota (e.g., Wisconsin, Chippewa, and St. Croix rivers) during a short hook and line season in the fall.  Angling in Minnesota has several restrictions as to season, fish sizes and gear and the reported annual sport catch was 2,200–4,200 kg in 1998–2000.  Harvest is not allowed in Iowa, Ohio, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and South Dakota. <br/> <br/>According to the CITES Management Authority of Canada (CMAC 2000) sturgeon harvest in Canada consists of aboriginal, commercial and recreational fisheries. The entire North American commercial harvest of lake sturgeon comes from Canada where in 1997, 223 mt were caught in New Brunswick and Quebec, with 90% (200 mt) being taken from the St. Lawrence River. Catch in Ontario during the late 1990s ranged from 5–8 mt. Most of this came from Lake Huron with a small amount from Lake St. Clair. In 1998, international trade in lake sturgeon meat was reported to be 18.2 mt exported from Canada to the U.S. (mostly New York). No caviar exports are reported and no export quotas have been established by range states. Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans reported that in recent years total recreational catch from the North and South Saskatchewan rivers in Alberta and Saskatchewan amounted to about 1,000 fish. <br/> <br/><em>Acipenser fulvescens</em> is not listed as a species at risk by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Most subpopulations are thought to be capable of sustaining well-regulated fisheries. Although the species is managed and protected in Canada under the Federal Fisheries Act, regulations differ between provinces and are revised annually. This species is listed under provincial legislation as ""threatened"" in Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan (CMAC 2000). <br/> <br/>In recent years, interest in the restoration of lake sturgeon has increased greatly. Partnerships have been developed throughout the Great Lakes basin between state and federal natural resource agencies, commercial and sport fishers and other water users. Numerous management and recovery plans have been completed for select waters within the lake sturgeon range and are being implemented as resources allow. Their goals include conservation, rehabilitation and enhancement of sturgeon populations, completion of status assessments, harvest restrictions, identification and restoration of critical habitats and elimination of negative effects of dams.  <br/> <br/>Construction of spawning habitats using coarse stone rip-rapping has been undertaken in some states (particularly Wisconsin) and appears to be highly successful. Artificial culture and restocking of lake sturgeon is under development in Minnesota using wild broodstock. In New York, sturgeon eggs are taken from wild stocks in the St. Lawrence River and cultured fingerlings have been reared and released in several locations since 1995. Survival has been high and populations appear to be recovering. In Missouri over 210,000 lake sturgeon fingerlings have been stocked in the upper Mississippi and lower Missouri rivers since 1986. Survival of stocked fish is considered excellent as tagged lake sturgeon have been recaptured in the Mississippi, Missouri, Gasconade and Osage rivers and commercial fishermen have reported incidental catches reaching nuisance proportions (Hesse and Carreiro 1997).  Artificial culture and restocking of lake sturgeon is also under development in Minnesota using wild broodstock. Wisconsin DNR propagates some lake sturgeon for restocking purposes with cultured fish only being placed into the same basins from which broodstock were taken. The Tennessee Valley Authority has stocked thousands of young lake sturgeon within the Ohio River Basin.   <br/> <br/>A Lake Sturgeon Management Plan has been implemented in Alberta since 1997. This involves a zero catch limit on the North Saskatchewan River; and on the South Saskatchewan, a closed season during the 1 April to 15 June spawning period with a one fish limit (greater than 130 cm) outside that restricted season. There is no aboriginal fishery in Alberta. In Saskatchewan, a self-imposed moratorium on commercial catch of lake sturgeon has been in place since 1996 and sport angling has not been allowed since 1999. A multi-agency study of habitat, fish migration and abundance is currently underway (CMAC 2000). Manitoba reduced its possession limit of lake sturgeon to zero in 1995. The remaining few commercial fisheries closed down during the 1990s but catch and release angling is still allowed in addition to aboriginal subsistence fishing in most rivers. Lake sturgeon population management has been initiated in several Manitoba rivers with involvement of First Nations communities. <br/> <br/>In Ontario, a Lake Sturgeon Assessment Program has been implemented for Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair, including population abundance estimation and tagging to identify movements and verify ages. As enough information is developed a management plan for the species will be drafted. Commercial catch quotas of lake sturgeon were established in 1984 and were adjusted periodically - through never achieved. In 1997, the catch quotas amounted to 1,500 kg in Lake St. Clair and 13,124 kg in Lake Huron. Huron catch that year was 5,471 kg, the highest of the previous several years. <br/> <br/>Quebec allows the harvest of lake sturgeon with 19–20.3 cm mesh gill nets only during an open season of 14 June through 31 October. A minimum fish length is in effect and quotas are enforced by the requirement that all fish for market must be tagged, and the tag must stay with the fish until it is processed. Quebec sport fishermen may catch and keep one fish per day.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

They feed primarily on nectar and pollen, gliding at night between feed trees and sometimes foraging close to the ground. They usually forage alone, possibly to avoid predators (Van Dyck 1993; Jackson 1998). They use tree hollows as dens for sleeping and rearing young (Jackson 2000a). First breeding occurs at around 12 - 18 months and young are weaned after 4 - 5 months (Jackson 2000b).","Clearing of forest for sugar cane, bananas, pineapples, improved pasture, Caribbean pine, and aquaculture has had a dramatic impact on habitat and has lead to a corresponding reduction in the distribution and connectivity of the species. Only 20 percent of former available habitat remains (Blackman <em>et al.</em> 1994) and this is severely fragmented (Parsons and Latch 2007). Altered fire regimes, weed invasion, and intensive grazing threaten the structure and ecological integrity of remaining habitat fragments. The subsequent decline in habitat quality and isolation of populations are major threats to the species’ survival. Major roads disrupt movements of Mahogany Gliders and road kills have been recorded. Mahogany Gliders also can become entangled on barbed-wire fences resulting in fatalities (P. Latch pers. comm.).","The Mahogany Glider is cryptic, elusive, and virtually silent.

However, in spite of its large extent of occurrence (EOO), it is plausible that its area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 2,000 km². Its distribution is severely fragmented, and there is also continuing decline in the area of occupancy, and the extent and quality of its habitat. Therefore the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B2.<br/><br/>Based on small population size for some subpopulations, and the relatively few known subpopulations, the population size may be less than 10,000 individuals (but cannot be reliably estimated to be less than that threshold); no subpopulation has more than 1,000 individuals, and there is continuing decline in habitat quality and extent, and hence in population size.<br/><br/>Note that in a review of status of this species in Queensland, Dickman <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered that its status was Endangered there, noting that ‘its small and declining population and range size suggest that it is more at risk in Queensland than previously believed’. However, substantially more survey work has been conducted in Queensland since, revealing a far more extensive distribution than previously known, with sizeable (but less than 1,000 individuals) subpopulations at some sites (I. Gynther pers. comm).","The Water Mouse is a nocturnal rodent with unusual habitat and diet characteristics. It occurs mostly in near coastal regions, with most records from mangroves (within inland edges of mangroves and on tidal flats) and some records from saline grasslands or sedgelands and near-coastal freshwater swamps (Van Dyck 1997, Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2000, Ball 2004), or where there is a juxtaposition of these features (Russell and Hale 2009). It typically builds a distinctive mud dome nest (or set of burrows in earth banks sometimes with an additional mud dome), within which a dominant male and other animals may live communally (Van Dyck and Durbidge 1992, Van Dyck 1997, Van Dyck and Gynther 2003, Ball 2004). Other nests are constructed inside hollow tree trunks, usually mangroves, with mud sometimes visible at the base of the tree or sealing any openings in the trunk above ground level (Magnusson <em>et al</em>. 1976, Van Dyck and Gynther 2003, Gynther 2011).<br/><br/>The Water Mouse forages on the ground, in tidal flats, and around the water’s edge with most prey comprising invertebrates, including crabs, pulmonates and molluscs (Van Dyck 1997). Home range size averaged 0.6 ha in one Queensland study; and 3.4 ha at another site (Van Dyck 1997).<br/><br/>Little is known of breeding characteristics. Reproduction may occur throughout the year (Van Dyck 1997). Females produce up to four young (Gynther and Janetzki 2008). Age to maturity and longevity are unknown; generation length is assumed to be 2-3 years (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p></p>","The water Mouse is potentially threatened by the destruction of mangrove habitats, through reclamation projects and the development of marine aquaculture. Agriculture and development are a threat across swamp and wetland habitats. The species tends not to survive where there is development inland of mangrove areas. Across most of its range, wetland habitats are degraded by livestock and feral animals. Gynther and Janetzki (2008) name oil pollution, waste water treatment, acid sulphate contamination, alteration of natural hydrology, and chemical control of biting insects as major threats. Predation by feral Domestic Cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) may be a threat, but extent and impact are not known, and much of its preferred habitat is likely to be not appreciably used by cats. Threats in the New Guinea portion of range are not well defined. Climate change is likely to result in marked diminution of habitat extent and quality (Traill <em>et al. </em>2011).","There has been no robust assessment of population size; however Dickman <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated the population size in Queensland to be between 1,000 and 10,000 individuals. For its Australian range, Gynther and Janetzki (2008) considered it ‘rare, scattered’.<br/><br/>For the Queensland component of its range, Dickman <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered that the population size was ‘suspected to be declining’, and Van Dyck and Gynther (2012) documented the recent extirpation of one subpopulation and the decline of another. For the Northern Territory component of its range, Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2007) considered population trends were unknown. Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014) considered the Australian population to comprise 10,000 mature individuals (with low reliability) and to be declining.<br/><br/>Traill <em>et al</em>. (2011) used Population Viability Analysis (PVA) modelling to examine its responses to climate change (through sea level rise), increased development of coastal areas and predation by feral Cats, for south-eastern Queensland. Although this study noted some expected benefit through inland migration of mangrove vegetation, the overall model suggested extirpation in the region in <em>ca</em> 50 years.",Decreasing,"This little-known species is present on the island of New Guinea (Papua New Guinea only) and in northern Australia. On New Guinea, it is known only from a few specimens collected in the south-west Trans-Fly River region.

The main current threats for Manatees are hunting for meat consumption (Denkinger 2010, Brice <em>et al.</em> 2011, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sandoval 2015), entanglement in fishing nets and habitat alterations.</p>  <p><em>Illegal hunting</em>, for both subsistence and local use, is considered the main threat to Manatees in the Amazon. Manatee populations have supported a tremendous take in past centuries and, although not at commercial levels, hunting still takes place throughout the region (Barbosa <em>et al. </em>2010a, b; Franzini <em>et al. </em>2013; Silva <em>et al. </em>2014; M. Marmontel pers. obs). Most hunting is practiced with the use of traditional harpoons, but in Ecuador Manatees may be caught in traps set for <em>Arapaima</em> (Hidalgo 2010).</p>  <p>Hunters usually sell products to neighbors and nearby communities, but the meat is sometimes sold in local produce fairs or markets in the interior, or by order directly with the hunter. Public markets in Brazil (Manaus, Manacapuru, Beruri, Novo Airão, Tefé, Silves, Itapiranga, Itacoatiara, Santarém, Belém, Monte Alegre and Almeirim, Benjamin Constant, Atalaia do Norte) and Ecuador also illegally offer the meat for sale. Meat is sold in natura, or as ""mixira"" or subproducts such as sausage. The mixira, which is the meat preserved in its own fat, is one of the products that prolongs the pressure on the species, since it commands a high price.</p>  <p>Take estimates are available only for a few sites where conservation and research projects are taking place. Between 2002 and 2004, 64 Manatees were estimated to have been killed in the Amanã-Castanho area (3,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of Amanã SDR (Calvimontes 2009), most of them adult males. Between 2011 and 2015, the hunt count for the same area was 42 Manatees. Some 195 Manatees were estimated to have been killed between 2011 and 2015 in the Uatumã River valley (Brazil) through the expeditions of Project Protecting Life in Uatumã (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016). In the Urucu region of Brazil 20 Manatees were captured between 2004 and 2007, 14 harpooned and 6 entangled (Franzini <em>et al.</em> 2013). Pantoja (2015) estimated 92 Manatees hunted in the area of the lower Javari river, Brazil, between 1980 and 2014. Based on interviews conducted in the Piagaçu Purus SDR (Purus river, Brazil), approximately 460 Manatees were killed in the protected area between 2004 and 2014 (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Based on 48 interviews, 36 manatees were captured in the Region of the Middle Madeira and Aripuanã Rivers (Amazon, Brazil) between 1986-2004: 89% poached and 11% entangled (Castelblanco-Martínez<em> et al</em>. 2007).</p><p> </p>  <p>The Natütama Foundation, which has a year-round Manatee monitoring program in place since 2002, registered three Manatees hunted in Colombia from 2003 to 2013 (Kendall 2013) and more than six in Peru from 2010-2015. Manatees are still being hunted in the river Putumayo upstream from Tarapaca and above the mouth of the Igaraparana, according to interviews with local Colombian fishermen, who say most of the hunters are Peruvian (S. Kendall pers. obs.). </p>  <p>In the Pacaya Samiria Reserve (Peru), Soto (2007) estimated an average of 35 Manatees killed in the basins of the Punahua, Ucayali and Marañon rivers.</p>  <p><strong>Incidental mortality, orphaned calves, and illegal captivity</strong></p>  <p>In addition to specific gillnets to hunt Manatees, the high use of fishing nets in the Amazon has increased incidental calf mortality in the past few years. These events have been documented in all Amazonian Manatee range countries (Reeves<em> et al. </em>1996, Orozco 2001, Franzini 2008, Souza 2015), and this is now a major threat for the species (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>When calves survive drowning in nets, they may be kept alive for later sale<span lang=""EN-US""> as pets, kept in pools or areas close to water bodies, and sold or given to influential persons. The number of rescued calves every year has been increasing, but the number recorded represents a small sample of occurrences in the Amazon.</p>  <p>Between 2008 and 2010, in the Brazilian state of Pará, 28 stranded Manatees were rescued, of which only one was an adult (Sousa <em>et al. </em>2010). An important threat in Pará is the use of fishing corrals, as they are usually built over submerged aquatic vegetation beds, where Manatees feed, and have already trapped a Manatee (M. Sousa, pers. com. 2016).</p>  <p>Presently, several institutions in Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Centro de Pesquisa e Preservação de Mamíferos Aquáticos, Mamirauá Institute and Zoofit) care for over 150 Manatees in captivity, mostly orphans. Between 2005 and 2015, INPA received an average of 10 calves per year. Of the 98 animals rescued during this period, 30% were accidentally caught in fishing nets (D. Souza pers. obs). In the past 10 years CPPMA received 39 calves for rehabilitation (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016).</p>  <p>From 2010-2015, 3 calves died in nets or captivity in Peru (S. Kendall pers obs). It is estimated that two Amazonian Manatees are presently in captivity in Colombia (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>Between 2007 and 2010, Centro de Rescate Amazónico (Iquitos, Peru) rescued 28 Manatees (Perea <em>et al. </em>2011), and until 2013 successfully rehabilitated 25 individuals (Landeo-Yauri <em>et al. </em>2013). Since 2011 &#160;the Centro released and monitored 11 of those rehabilitated animals (Landeo and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Velásquez Varela <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p><strong>Habitat alteration and disturbance</strong></p>  <p>Other anthropogenic actions have resulted in pollution, loss, alteration, degradation and fragmentation of habitats used by the Amazonian Manatee (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). </p>  <p>Changes in the aquatic environment as habitat degradation due to deforestation, pollution, contamination of the rivers by mercury for the gold exploration (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 2000), pesticides and heavy metals from agricultural waste and oil spills are potential hazards to the Manatee´s food supply (Rosas <em>et al. </em>1991). These elements are absorbed by aquatic weeds and may directly affect the staple diet of the species (Rosas 1994). Roots of floating and rooted aquatic plants (<em>Paspalum, Eicchornia, Salvinia</em>) have been shown to be important methylation sites (Guimarães <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Over 300 dams are planned for the Amazon (Winemiller <em>et al. </em>2016), two of which are mega-enterprises in Brazil (Madeira and Xingu rivers). The building of dams can interfere with habitat quality, altering water speed, nutrient load and dynamics of macrophyte production (Junk and Nunes de Mello 1987). Brazil has extensive plans for navigation (Fearnside 2001, Brazil, PR, 2011) with dams allowing the opening of the waterway in the Tapajos river (Fearnside 2015) planned for soy transport, giving access to the Amazon river and the Atlantic ocean (Brazil, PR 2011, Millikan 2011).&#160;Amazonian Manatees are very sensitive to noise, and intense boat traffic on the Amazonian rivers can affect their behaviour and habitat use.</p>  <p>Oil spills may be a particular problem in Ecuador (Brice <em>et al. </em>2011, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013, Brice 2014), where oil exploitation has been permitted in important refuges for the species (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013). The use of fertilizers and weed control products in extensive monocultures (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013), incidental captures in fishing nets, the use of dynamite, the increasing use of motorized boats including in the Cuyabeno and Jatuncocha systems where there are nature tourism activities (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, b) are additional threats in Ecuador.</p>  <p>On the Peru-Colombia border, wood extraction activities are clogging lakes and stopping normal migrations of Manatees in the Atacuari area (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p>Amazonian human populations are generally at low densities except in the large capital cities, but all of the issues above could be magnified by the increase in human population.</p><p>Tourism and transport are interfering more and more with low water resting places in the area around Puerto Nariño (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>Around the city of Belém and estuary of the Amazon River, boat traffic is intense and even ferries and cargo ships may interfere with Manatee movement (Miranda Leão <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p><strong>Natural disasters, drought, climate change</strong></p><p>Extreme droughts may help make the Manatee an easier prey item for hunters, by causing isolation and entrapment. During the 2010 drought in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Purus River, Brazil), 180 Manatees were estimated killed (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014), but only a few cases of Manatees trapped by drought in the eastern Peruvian frontier area were recorded, and none in Colombia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p></p>","<p>Most of the waters inhabited by Amazonian Manatees are very murky and, probably as an adaptation to the past and ongoing hunting pressure, Amazonian Manatees are extremely secretive.&#160;T<span class=""alt-edited"">remendous<span class=""shorttext""> research efforts have been made,<span lang=""EN""> but&#160;there are no reliable population estimates available, although numbers are almost certainly lower than historical figures due to centuries of hunting. Analysis of feeding patches, direct sightings of <em>T. inunguis</em> and interview surveys have been used to try to estimate population numbers with limited results, due to opportunistic sightings and small samples without standardized effort. Traditional mark-recapture studies are not appropriate due to the species’ secretive nature. More recently there have been efforts to estimate populations with the use of rotary or side-scan sonars, but still with inconclusive results (Brice 2014, Francisco <em>et al.</em> 2015), which hinders the development of conservation strategies for the species. Magor empirically estimated a minimum population of 10,000 Amazonian Manatees for the Amazon basin (Husar 1977). Based on the analysis of mtDNA control region, Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>(2005) suggested a genetic estimate of the effective female population size of <em>T. inunguis</em> of approximately 455,000 individuals, indicative of a recent large population size. Genetic studies do not show a population structure throughout the region (Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p><p>In Colombia, due to conservation efforts with local communities, a reduction in hunting levels and an apparent increase in&#160;Amazonian&#160;Manatee population in specific sites has been noted in the last few years. In the Colombian Amazon, the population may have stabilized, but hunting continues on the Peruvian side of the river and this affects the Colombian population. During 2010-2015, Natütama registered 3 to 4 new calves every year in Colombia. Fishermen insist that there are more Manatees now, mainly because they see groups of 7 to 10 Manatees more often (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Systematic monitoring with former Manatee hunters recorded 364 sightings around Puerto Nariño in 2014, including five different calves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;</span><em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2015).</p><p>A study conducted 1996-1999 in Cuyabeno Reserve (Ecuador) contradicted Timm <em>et al.</em>'s<em>&#160;</em>(1986) prediction of extinction in 10 years. However, relative abundance in Cuyabeno River was 0.01 animal / h effort and 0.007 animal / h effort in Lagartococha River. A total 40-49 animals were sighted in the Cuyabeno Reserve between 1996 and 1998, where they are considered rare (Denkinger 2010). The use of sonar produced estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 individuals / 10 km in three sites (Parque Nacional Yasuni, Lagartococha and Cocaya lake systems); no animals were detected in 58 km of the Cuyabeno lagoon system (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Brice (2014), using side-scan sonar observed 24 individuals in 70 hours of sampling in the same region. In Ecuador the species is considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria C2a(i), which indicates an estimated population of less than 250 mature individuals, and no subpopulation with 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2001).</p><p>Guzmán (2014), also using a side scan sonar, recorded 14 Manatees in 65 km of rivers and lagoons, or 2.15 ind / 10 km in the Lagartococha river, on border Peru-Ecuador, an area partially surveyed by Utreras <em>et al. </em>(2013). Bodmer <em>et al. </em>(2006) believed the population in the Pacaya Samiria Reserve was stable due to a slight increase in counts between 2003 and 2006. However, Soto (2007) points out that the estimation method has not yet been proven.</p><p>In some sustainable development reserves (SDR) in Brazilian Amazon, hunting has been decreasing over the recent years. This is probably a reflection of the conservation actions that have occurred in the region, and the lack of interest among young fishermen for hunting the Manatee. The frequent records of sightings of adults and females with calves during the rainy and dry seasons in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Souza 2015) suggest that populations of <em>T. inunguis</em> may be stable or increasing in these regions.</p><p>Sixty two per cent&#160;of hunters interviewed by Calvimontes (2009) in Amanã SDR (Brazil) believed the population is decreasing, although they attribute this to Manatees having moved away (due to habitat alterations and increasing levels of noise) rather than hunting. Calvimontes also reported that most hunters are turning into farmers, which should decrease the pressure on the species.&#160;Seventy three&#160;per cent of interviewees in the Belém region (mouth of the Amazon) considered the Manatee population is decreasing, due to hunting, pollution, boat traffic and noise (Miranda 2014). Half of the respondents in Franzini <em>et al.</em>'s&#160;(2013) study believed Manatee numbers are declining.</p><p>Seventy&#160;per cent&#160;of interviewees in the Ucayali region of Peru believed the population is decreasing (Silva <em>et al. </em>2014). In a preliminary survey of Manatees in the Lagartococha region, in 6.9 km of canoe transects Hidalgo (2010) observed 16 Manatees and 25 feeding patches, which lead him to evaluate that Manatees in the Lagartococha river basin may be stable due to the almost null human presence.</p><p>The progressive increase in the number of young calves arriving at rehabilitation centres in Brazil in the past five years has also led several researchers to suspect that the species may be undergoing some recovery, or that the increase is simply a reflection of the awareness campaigns implemented, with a concomitant increase in the number of rescued calves (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005). Alternatively, it may also suggest that calf takes are on the rise.</p><p>Although Manatees are widespread through a large area, there is a high level of uncertainty about population size, as no reliable method for determining abundance has been defined so far. Whatever the current population size, the overall population trend is most likely to be decreasing, given the species’ slow reproduction (sirenian populations grow at an annual rate of approximately 5-6%; Marsh<em> et al. </em>2004, 2011) and levels of exploitation (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 1992). In summary, although the population may be stabilizing in some parts of the Amazon region due to local awareness building and other conservation efforts, the overall trend is of a decreasing population.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Amazonian Manatees occur in northern South America, and are endemic to the Amazon Basin. Amazonian Manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, in river and lake systems, from the headwaters, in Colombia (Domning 1981), Ecuador (Timm <em>et al. </em>1986) and Peru (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1996) to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Marajó Island) in Brazil (Best and Teixeira 1982, Miranda 2014) over an estimated seven million square kilometres. However, they are patchily distributed, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km² (Junk 1997), but are limited by troubled waters (rapids and falls) and aquatic vegetation (Best 1983).</p>  <p>In Ecuador most records are from the extreme northeast, below 250 m altitude. From north to south there are records for the Güeppi river (tributary of Putumayo, in the border with Colombia), the Aguarico river and its Cuyabeno and Lagartococha systems, where most of the records come from (Denkinger 2010, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in tributaries such as the Yanayacu, Cocaya and Zancudococha lagoon; in the Napo region they are found in the Añangu, Challuacocha and Yuturi lagoon systems, as well as in the Tiputini river and Yasuní basin, including the Jatuncocha and Tambococha lagoon systems (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a). In Peru they occur in the Loreto region in the Samiria, Pacaya, Marañón, Pastaza, Ucayali, Huallaga, Purus, Tapiche, Yarapa and Yanayacu rivers, as well as in the lower Puinahua and Iricahua rivers in the Ucayali basin; their occurrence has been mentioned for the Nanay, Orosa, Yavarí, Yaguas and Putumayo rivers, and in the Reserva&#160; Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, and in the Yanayacu-Pucate river (Silva 2010); in Colombia in the Putumayo, Amazon and lower Caquetá rivers; in Brazil they occur in most major river basins such as Solimões, Japurá, Juruá, Purus, Negro and Tapajós.</p>  <p>Although there are no records in the Guyana, the species may occasionally penetrate into southern Guiana close to the boundary with Brazil (Bertram and Bertram 1963). This possibility is enhanced by a Manatee rescue done by INPA in Takutu River border Brazil and Guyana (D. Souza pers. obs).</p>","<p>The historical main use of <em>T. inunguis</em> was to obtain oil, skin and meat (Domning 1982). In remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 Manatees were killed between 1935 and 1954, not counting subsistence hunting (Best 1983, Rosas and Pimentel 2001), which still persists in modern times.</p><p>  </p><p>Currently, the main use of the species is for food. Manatee meat is highly valued, but all the other products are used as well (fat and skin are used in cooking and as medicine, bones are turned into utilitarian pieces and charms, and the skin produces very resistant leather). Medicinal uses are attributed to the fat being rubbed on the affected area (rheumatism and paralysis) and skin (helping the healing process of wounds and infections) (Miranda 2014). A Manatee is held for show to tourists in Puerto Alegria, Peru, upstream from Leticia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Manatees are protected by national laws in all countries of confirmed distribution (Brazil since 1967, Colombia since 1969, Peru since 1973 (Silva 2009) and Ecuador since 2002 (Tirira 2011)). Listed under Appendix I of CITES, signed by the four countries, also signatories of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. All but Colombia are parties to the Convention on Migratory Species.</p><p>Presently there are national management plans specific for the species in Colombia (Dirección de Ecosistemas 2005) and Brazil (Andrade <em>et al.</em> 2011) and for aquatic mammals (including Manatees) in Ecuador (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Management plans exist for two protected areas (Pacaya Samiria in Peru and Mamiraua Reserve in Brazil), and Puerto Nariño (Colombia) has informal local management agreement (S. Kendall pers. obs).</p><p>In 2014 the Biodiversity department of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador included Manatee as a focal species for conservation, and relative abundance studies are planned for the Cuyabeno-Yasuni corridor in the Napo river basin between 2016 and 2018. The same department is attempting to have the corridor between the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve and the Yasuní National Park recognized as a RAMSAR site (V.

Unfortunately, hunting continues even within protected areas.</p><p>Some 90% of the possible area of distribution of Manatees in Colombia is outside of protected areas. In Colombia the conservation work has been greatly based on participation of local communities (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). Efforts include year-round conservation and monitoring by the Natütama Foundation in the key areas of the Colombian Amazon, with information network for nearby areas; intensive education program<a name=""_GoBack""></a> in the Colombian Amazon, with occasional visits to Tarapaca on the Putumayo river; release of calves by fishermen in the Colombian Amazon (Kendall 2013): 4 releases from nets from 2010-2015 by Natutama and associated fishermen (S.

45197343,6082,Cynogale bennettii,Endangered,C1,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Otter Civet is listed as Endangered because of a presumed small and declining population. Based on data in&#160;Miettinen&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011), the presumed primary habitat for Otter Civet has been greatly reduced historically and has declined by about 20% over the last two generations (presumed to be 10 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The remaining habitat is discontinuous, often degraded; and water sources, presumed to be important for the species, are often polluted. As a ground-dwelling species snares will also be a threat. The population is therefore likely to have declined by substantially more than 20% in the last 10 years.<br/><br/>A map of the area of Otter Civet occupancy for Borneo predicted an area of potentially occupied habitat of 261,614 km². Applying the same reasoning regarding habitat suitability, an additional 44,094 km² and 34,999 km² could plausibly be available in Sumatra and the Thai-Malay peninsula, respectively. Despite this relatively large area of suitable habitat, Otter Civet is rarely recorded by camera-trap (or other survey method) in the vast majority of its range, even in areas assumed to be good habitat, for example, the peat swamp forests of Sabangau National Park (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010) or Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald pers. comm. 2014). A review of small carnivore records from Thailand did not trace any camera-trap records of Otter Civet and no records from any method since 1998; it might be on the verge of national extinction (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Records are also infrequent from Peninsular Malaysia (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006), with apparently only two records&#160;since 1990 (M. Gumal pers comm. 2014).&#160;As of late 2014, there are no records from Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Than Zaw pers. comm. 2014). It has been recorded more frequently in at least two areas of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, both logged lowland forest, with data from one of these areas indicating a breeding population (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010, A.J. Hearn and J. Ross&#160;pers comm. 2014). However, it is unclear why these two surveys resulted in comparatively high detection rates; surveys in adjacent forest reserves using similar techniques resulted in few records, suggesting that these apparent higher abundances are very localised. Records from Sumatra are also few, although in some areas detections are more frequent than in its mainland range (ZSL Indonesia Programme pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Although Otter Civet seems able to tolerate some forms of habitat disturbance such as logging, it has never been recorded in plantations and its tolerance to each form of habitat disturbance remains unknown. The paucity of records across most of its range, despite intensive and/or long-term camera-trapping in some areas, suggests that it probably exists at very low densities range-wide, although this might vary much. Across its range, average densities might be as low as 1-2 individuals per 100 km² (inferred from very low detection rates in most areas), especially because&#160;it is plausible that the distribution is very patchy with large areas where Otter Civet is no longer present, despite suitable habitat and other areas where densities are higher locally. The number of mature individuals is therefore plausibly fewer than 2,500 (equivalent to a total population of around 3,800) indicating (in combination with the suspected decline rate) a categorisation as Endangered under C1. The large uncertainty in this assessment means Vulnerable is similarly plausible: continuation of the 2008&#160;Endangered&#160;listing is explicitly precautionary. In some areas, the lack of camera-trap records might reflect inappropriate camera-trap placement; the overall few detections might reflect the rarity of surveys in prime Otter Civet habitat. Should future survey results challenge the key assumptions urging a cautious approach (near-restriction to gentle terrain, predominantly lowland; high sensitivity to conversion, degradation and fragmentation of forested wetlands, to pollution and to hunting; and a generally low density with only highly localised higher densities) the Red List categorisation would need revising. It is likely that it would then meet the criteria for Vulnerable under A2 and A3 (which it comfortably meets at present based on coarse habitat loss rates) and C1.","Little is known of Otter Civet&#160;habitat and ecology. This species was believed to be confined&#160;largely&#160;to peat swamp forests, but there are now also&#160;records from lowland dipterocarp forest (Sebastian 2005, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. in prep.). It seems to be most strongly associated with lowland primary forest, but it has been recorded in secondary forest, bamboo, and logged forest (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006, Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010, A.J. Hearn and J. Ross pers. comm. 2014); its long-term persistence in these habitats is unknown (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006). It has also been recorded in freshwater swamp forest and in limestone forest amid acacia plantation in Bukit Sarang Conservation Area, Sarawak (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007). It has been recorded at 1,370 m a.s.l. in Bario, Sarawak, but the majority of records are from lowland forest (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. in prep.).&#160;Otter Civet is semi-aquatic (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006) and is&#160;assumed to forage in water for fish, crabs, molluscs, small mammals, and birds (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). It is predominantly nocturnal (Sebastian 2005, Ross <em>et al</em>. in prep. a).","Reduction in primary forest habitat has proceeded very fast throughout the lowland Sundaic region in the last 20 years (e.g.,&#160;Holmes 2000,&#160;BirdLife International 2001, Jepson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Kinnaird&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames <em>et al.</em> 2005, Miettinen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Stibig&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This has probably reduced Otter Civet&#160;populations by at least the rate of forest loss.&#160;Silting and general pollution of waterways associated with the logging of forests and chemical pollution from activities such as gold mining may also be disproportionally detrimental to this semi-aquatic civet. Conversion of peat swamp forests to oil palm plantations is likely to be a major threat particularly to this species. There is no evidence that the species is specifically hunted, but as a ground-dwelling species it will be exposed to the snares and ground-level traps set for other species. The number of animals caught and effect on the population are unknown.","Very little is known about Otter Civet population trends and abundance. Sebastian (2005) considered&#160;its apparent rarity, deduced from a low detection frequency even in heavily surveyed areas, to be puzzling. It is important to determine whether low detection rates reflect bias in choice of survey areas and/or survey methods, or stem from naturally low population densities. All evidence suggests that it is forest dependent and possibly is dependent on clear and unpolluted water sources; therefore it is reasonable to assume the population is in decline. Although it has been detected in logged forest, population densities are likely to be lower there than in primary forest (see&#160;Heydon and Bulloh 1996).",Decreasing,"Otter Civet has a Sundaic distribution. It is found in Malaysia (peninsular and Borneo), Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo), Brunei Darussalam and Thailand. Assuming the&#160;sight-record at Kaeng Krachan in the north of peninsula&#160;Thailand is valid (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), the species is likely also to occur in Peninsular Myanmar, although there are no records from Myanmar to date. With no specific search for the species and very little general survey in the relevant parts of the country, this lack of records does not strongly suggest the species’ absence&#160;(Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Than Zaw pers. comm. 2014). There is a very old record labelled as from Singapore (Meiri 2005) but there is no evidence that this was not a traded specimen, and no other indication that the&#160;species has&#160;ever occurred in the country&#160;(Chua <em>et al</em>. 2012). A 1920s record from northern Viet Nam was assumed by Veron <em>et al</em>. (2006) to have an erroneous provenance. Three subsequent reports from Yunnan province, China, and one from non-Sundaic Thailand, which lent an appearance of mutual corroboration to the Viet Nam locality, are based only on second-hand reports and have not been verified with either specimens or photographs (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989, Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2013). Therefore, the&#160;species is&#160;taken here not to occur outside&#160;Sundaic&#160;Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Recent records of Otter Civet from Borneo are from Sarawak (e.g., Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007), Sabah (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010, A.J. Hearn and J. Ross pers. comm. 2014) and Central Kalimantan (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010). There are also recent records from east-central Sumatra (ZSL Indonesia Programme pers. comm. 2014). As of late 2014, only two recent records were traced from the Thai-Malay peninsula, both from the Endau-Rompin Landscape, Johor, Malaysia: once each in 2012 and 2013 (M. Gumal pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Otter Civet has been recorded at 1,370 m a.s.l. in Bario, Sarawak, but the majority of records are from lowland forest, down to sea-level (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. in prep.).","There is no known specific demand for Otter Civet, but because much mammal-hunting in its range uses non-selective techniques, it is likely to be part of the general off-take of wild meat and, like other civets, eaten.",Terrestrial,"Otter Civet is listed in Appendix II of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora,&#160;and as ‘threatened’ in the <em>IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids</em> (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989). Its conservation requires protection of forest and riverine habitat, and policing against illegal harvesting of timber and hunting (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006). Conservation priorities would be better refined by clarification of its tolerance to degraded, fragmented, secondary and converted habitats, including riverine areas in plantations and other areas that maintain some natural vegetation, and its&#160;occurrence in the various types of wetland habitat. The paucity of recent records in the&#160;Thai-Malay peninsular, despite an increase in the use of camera-traps, is of great concern, and warrants specific search for the species.<br/><br/>This species has been detected in a fair number of protected areas throughout its range, including Bukit Sarang Conservation Area, Sarawak (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007), Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand, in 1998 (Anon. 1998), Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006), Sembilang National Park, Sumatra (ZSL Indonesia Programme pers. comm. 2014), Danau Sentarum National Park, West Kalimantan (Jeanes and Meijaard 2000), Danum Valley Conservation Area and Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah (A.J.

Its main land-type of occurrence, level lowland, is also the main one sought for conversion to agriculture, infrastructure and settlement, driving therefore much faster declines than are seen in species otherwise similar but which occur widely in hill and mountain forest. In countries other than Cambodia, potentially Myanmar, and perhaps parts of Thailand, it is reduced to small isolated populations, many of which may have poor long-term prospects because suitable habitat is restricted in each area to small peripheral parts.&#160;The 2008 assessment, as Vulnerable, stressed the difficulty of determining the population loss rates through habitat and hunting. It noted specifically that ""if strong forest protection activities are implemented in Cambodia this [Vulnerable] will need revision. Conversely, this assessment may be overly optimistic ... better data might even indicate EN [Endangered] status"". Forest conversion rates in lowland Cambodia have indeed outstripped those predicted at the last assessment, with major incursion into even some formerly flagship protected areas. The regionally strengthening economy suggests that deforestation rates will continue to rise in Cambodia, and the rising level of external investment into Myanmar with the easing of economic sanctions guarantees rapid rates of conversion of level lowlands there (areas which are mostly not so far surveyed for the species). Trade-driven hunting, particularly cable-snaring, which is likely to have caused the declines of a large suite of ground-dwelling mammals in Viet Nam and other range states, is reported to be on the increase in several protected areas in Cambodia. Thus, while information is too imprecise to be sure that the species might not more appropriately be categorised as Vulnerable, Critically Endangered is also a possibility.","Several examinations of records over varying geographic scales have concluded that Large-spotted Civet is basically a lowland species, with records over 300 m a.s.l. relatively unusual and almost confined to areas of level or gentle terrain (Duckworth 1997, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, Jennings and Veron 2011, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is camera-trapped in large numbers in some areas, without the use of special techniques (Austin 1999, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, Jenks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014); this allows high confidence that the extreme paucity of records from above 600 m and from hilly terrain above 300 m, despite extensive camera-trapping in most range states in such areas, truly reflects a great rarity of Large-spotted Civet at these altitudes. Nonetheless, Large-spotted Civet has occasionally been found much higher. Some such records (e.g. Kon Ka Kinh, Viet Nam; probably within 700-900 m; Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005) come from areas of mid-altitude plateau terrain, which also support other predominantly lowland species. The highest precise-altitude record is perhaps a camera-trap record in 2010 from interior Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, at 780 m; this area had been heavily camera-trapped over the preceding decade without finding the species and its occurrence so high is evidently exceptional (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Within suitable altitude and terrain, the species has been recorded in a number of different habitats: natural habitats assigned directly by observers include evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, deciduous dipterocarp forest, <em>Melaleuca</em>-dominated swamp-forest, shrubland, wetlands and grassland. There are many records from degraded and edge areas as well as some from well within little-encroached blocks of habitat (Duckworth 1997, Austin 1999, Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Holden and Neang 2009, Jenks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Records from plantations (oil palm, teak and perhaps others) seem to come typically or invariably from close to natural habitat (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015).<br/><br/>Two recent investigations of habitat use, one (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010) for two parts of Cambodia, the other (Jennings and Veron 2011) across the species's non-Chinese range, assigned habitats from record coordinates and GIS habitat information, rather than directly by the surveyors. Both concluded the species is primarily one of deciduous forest. While there are many records of Large-spotted Civet from deciduous forest, there are also many from evergreen forest (see above) and, considering patterns of camera-trapping across habitats at altitudes below 300-400 m, it is certainly not, across its range, preferentially associated with deciduous forest.<br/><br/>Jennings and Veron (2011) provided no measure of relative survey effort between different habitat types, thus allowing the possibility that patterns of record distribution that they identified reflect patterns of survey distribution as much as or more than of animal distribution. Their habitat information source [Global Land Cover 2000 map for Southeast Asia (www.bioval.jrc.ec.europa.eu/products/glc2000/products.php; map 6)], was examined independently by J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Tizard (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;for areas of southern Lao PDR, Cambodia and adjacent Viet Nam with which they were familiar. Across much of the southern Indochinese lowlands, predominantly deciduous landscapes have strips of semi-evergreen forest along&#160;many&#160;rivers and patches on hill tops. Many of these were not, on the GLC map, distinguished from the surrounding deciduous matrix. Jennings and Veron's (2011) analysis cannot, therefore, determine the degree of evergreen versus deciduous habitat use in this large three-country area, and it is plausible that similar imprecision is present in the map for other plains biomes with extensive but not total deciduous forest. These evergreen forest patches and strips support some birds typical of evergreen forest and not of deciduous forest&#160;J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Tizard pers. comm. 2010); the same may be true of mammals although at least with carnivores this is less readily assessed.<br/><br/>Gray <em>et al</em>. (2010) used an apparently more precise source for habitats, and were able to build in some at least implicit measure of relative effort. It is therefore possible that in these two areas Large-spotted Civet is particularly associated with deciduous forest. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the apparent association may be an artefact if taken to be applicable across the&#160;species's range. The primary confounding variable is that terrain types on which deciduous dipterocarp and semi-evergreen forest occur within the Mondulkiri Protected Forest are significantly different. Semi-evergreen forest is primarily associated with rocky hill terrain (albeit at low elevation) in which slope angles and soil characteristics are unlike typical plains level semi-evergreen forest as occurs elsewhere in Cambodia and other parts of the species's range. In Mondulkiri PF, camera-trapping in semi-evergreen forest appears to have been located&#160;only&#160;in such hilly terrain. Such semi-evergreen forest might be ‘avoided’by Large-spotted Civet as a result of terrain type rather than vegetation type; whereas the deciduous forests in this areas are on gentle terrain as is typically occupied by this civet (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). That there may be significant undetermined factors driving the local-scale distribution of Large-spotted Civet in areas surveyed by Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) is suggested by the marked paucity of records from Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary compared with Mondulkiri PF. Although the habitats in these two areas are broadly similar, there are noticeable although somewhat subtle differences. Although Phnom Prich WS has a greater proportion of highly deciduous semi-evergreen forest (sometimes called mixed deciduous forest; poorly categorised and delineated on the JICA landcover maps) than does Mondulkiri PF, other differences suggest this factor alone may not be the most significant one in the apparent differences in <em>Viverra</em> civet occurrence data. Phnom Prich WS is on somewhat more rugged terrain than is Mondulkiri PF, especially when the camera-trap regions are compared (in part this may have some correlation with semi-evergreen forest/ highly deciduous semi-evergreen forest presence). Furthermore, deciduous dipterocarp forest differs between the two areas quite substantially: Phnom Prich WS has a much lower proportion of relatively open deciduous dipterocarp forest, and especially open ‘glades’, and a much higher proportion of the deciduous dipterocarp forest has an understorey dominated by small bamboo. Water sources are markedly fewer and more aggregated in Phnom Prich WS. Unless there was some bias in the camera-trapping protocol and camera placement, which is hard to imagine given the large numbers of Large Indian Civet <em>V. zibetha</em> detected, the paucity of Large-spotted Civet records from Phnom Prich WS suggests that the species may be relatively sensitive to further as yet unknown habitat characteristics.<br/><br/>Chutipong <em>et al</em>. (2014) intended also&#160;to assess the species's habitat use in Thailand by GIS, but the habitat types generated for the records, when checked by the original surveyors, produced far too many gross errors of classification for the method to be viable; this included the failure to distinguish between evergreen gallery forest and the surrounding extensive grassy deciduous dipterocarp forest, and multiple instances of semi-natural habitats being classed as plantations (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). Instead, R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014), in conjunction with the surveyors, inspected the locations by eye. In Thailand, there is no suggestion of an association with deciduous forest over evergreen. This analysis of Thai records again suggests&#160;that the species may have an even more restricted niche than was&#160;previously thought. Although there is wide occurrence across Thailand, detection rates, especially the proportions of camera-trap stations with detections, are very low in almost all areas (in eight of the nine sites with detections, fewer than five camera-trap stations found the species). At Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary, the only site with extensive lowland gentle terrain, the species was detected at 41 camera stations. Plotting the locations of all Thai Large-spotted Civet detections on terrain maps placed almost all records unequivocally on gentle terrain, mostly at the edges of protected areas that are centred on hill or mountainous terrain. One of the best examples of this is Khao Yai Natonal Park, which has had some of the most intensive camera-trapping in Thailand, yet Large-spotted Civet has been detected at only three camera-trap stations: two on low elevation, very gentle terrain at the very edge of the park, and a third at 780 m in more rugged terrain amid the main research area in the park with very high levels of camera-trapping in many years: it is clear that Large-spotted Civet does not occur regularly in that sector. Vegetation association in Thailand is less clear, for two main reasons: most low-elevation gentle terrain habitat is significantly degraded (mostly perhaps secondary) and to a degree fragmented; secondly it appears that little to no deciduous or largely deciduous low-elevation gentle terrain habitat survives in the camera-trap survey areas (indeed, such habitat is now rare in Thailand). Thus, there is no way to compare occurrence between semi-evergreen/evergreen and deciduous habitats, or intact with degraded and fragmented habitats. The Thai data suggest a possible greater association with mosaics of different habitats, but this might simply be an artefact of the habitat types present and camera-trapping procedures.&#160;An additional survey not included in Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2014) or the foregoing, of Huai Kha Khaeng&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Wongchoo 2014), detected Large-spotted Civet at few camera-trap stations. These were all in deciduous forest, but in this site evergreen forest is very localised below 400 m and nearly all camera-trapping was in deciduous forest; analysis suggested low altitude, not forest-type, best explained the distribution of the species in the survey area.<br/><br/>There has been no investigation of diet, ranging, productivity or other aspects of natural history, all of which, particularly if compared across habitats, might usefully inform conservation planning and implementation for this species.","Throughout much of Large-spotted Civet's range, ground-dwelling small carnivores are exposed to heavy hunting, particularly with snares and dogs. Some level of hunting pressure is likely to be almost universal. A rapid, ongoing expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam and China is in part driven by illegal trade in timber, wild meat and other forest resources, and by large infrastructure projects. This social change has driven a recent massive increase in demand for wildlife as luxury food in urban centres, particularly in China and Viet Nam; civets are a large part of this (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is no evidence that Large-spotted Civet is specifically sought (nor that it is eschewed); it is safe to assume that it comprises part of the general off-take, given that most methods are of low selectivity, such as lines of snares suitable for animals of this size class set at high density with drift fences (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving wildlife-meat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In many countries, the species's habitat use means that in many forest blocks it occurs mostly round the margins (lowlands) with the interior (often mostly hill forest) being unsuitable. This may insulate it to some extent from the worst of industrial snaring, because the peripheral areas are mostly already defaunated of high market-value species. Set against this, it is more likely in these areas to be encountered during general subsistence forest resource-gathering activities (e.g., firewood, food for domestic consumption, construction materials); people engaging in these are in many areas invariably accompanied by dogs, carrying guns and alert for any opportunistic hunting possibility for animals of this size-class and over. Of its current range states, Cambodia and, presumably, Myanmar both have multiple large protected areas comprising extensive areas at suitable altitude and terrain for this species. This gives more solid long-term options, but few of these are effectively managed at present, and hunting in some is known to be at very high levels.<br/><br/>Hunting is compounded by habitat loss. From the 1970s and the 1990s, large areas of lowland forest were converted to agriculture across parts the species's range, particularly in China, Thailand and Viet Nam (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Roberton 2007, Wang Ying-xiang pers. comm. 2006). Large areas were also logged and otherwise encroached. While this might well have had little direct effect on suitability for Large-spotted Civet, heavy hunting almost invariably accompanies such operations. Post-logging, the typically increased accessibility and fragmentation of habitat increases the threat of hunting and the negative effects on susceptible species (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005). While large-scale conversion of the small remaining tracts of lowland forest has mostly slowed in these countries since the 1990s, Lao PDR and, in particular, Cambodia are still within their main phase of conversion; and political and thus economic changes in Myanmar suggest the start of a similar upsurge there. Cambodia is presently seeing massive deforestation of the lowlands, particularly for local and plantation-scale agriculture; this is unquestionably reducing the extent of suitable habitat for Large-spotted Civet both outside and inside protected areas (T.N.E. Gray&#160;&#160;pers. comm. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). In Myanmar, there is a major trend in conversion of forest to plant oil agriculture, particularly in lowlands (J.W. Duckworth and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006).","Recent camera-trapping in many areas within Large-spotted Civet's geographic range has greatly clarified its population status. The following comments are made in the light of survey effort in suitable habitat (forested gentle terrain below 300 m, exceptionally to 500 m or more; see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in each country.<br/><br/>Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) generated no records in extensive surveys across Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan, southern China, and were aware of none this century. It is possible that Large-spotted Civet has been extirpated from China.<br/><br/>Roberton (2007) traced only nine confirmed records from Viet Nam, only two of which were since 1990. Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2012) collated camera-trap records from across Viet Nam and found only two records: U Minh Thuong National Park (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004) and Yok Don National Park (Eames <em>et al</em>. 2004). Subsequent small carnivore-focused surveys in the U Minh <em>Melalueca</em>-dominated wetlands failed to record the species, as have similar surveys in lowland habitats e.g. the Ke Go-Khe Net Lowlands and Cat Tien National Park (Save Viet Nam’s Wildlife pers. comm. 2014). Large-spotted Civet is now evidently very rare in Viet Nam and is probably very close to national extinction if not gone already; most natural lowland habitats in Viet Nam have been converted into agriculture, and what is under protection is known or can be assumed to suffer from intense trade-driven hunting.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Duckworth (1994) and Austin (1999) found the species easily in both areas of suitable habitat surveyed with suitable methodology in the early 1990s, Phou Xang He and Xe Pian National Protected Areas. There has been little subsequent survey in habitat potentially suitable for the species since then, with most conservation activity occurring in hilly areas (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014). Of two incidental records since 2000, one was adjacent to one of the earlier areas, Xe Pian NPA (Duckworth 2008) and one was some distance from other records, on the Nakai plateau; although this animal was seen in trade, it is unlikely it had been brought from afar (Khounboline 2005). Subsequent survey of the plateau by camera-trap (Dersu 2008) and the rounding up of animals isolated by the filling of the Nakai dam (U. Streicher pers. comm. 2010) did not find the species, indicating that it was probably even then extremely rare there. The suitable habitat on the plateau has now been flooded. Intense trade-driven hunting and fragmentation of remaining lowland natural and semi-natural habitat across Lao PDR, in an environment of highly uneven law enforcement, suggests that the Lao population is likely now to be very low. Although many areas of terrain and habitat potentially holding the species remain and have not been appropriately surveyed (see, e.g., SUFORD 2010), these are mostly outside the protected area system and are heavily hunted; the likelihood of Lao PDR still holding a large undiscovered population of Large-spotted Civet is very low (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>A compilation of camera-trap records from 21 survey areas in Thailand found Large-spotted Civet records in nine of them. In most of these areas, however, suitable habitat is of limited extent and is mostly around the margins; populations are likely to be low. Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary stands out as by far the largest area of suitable habitat surveyed; most of the camera-trap stations recording the species anywhere in the country were in this protected area (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Away from this single protected areas, populations are likely mostly to be small. Based on habitat and terrain, it is unlikely that any areas holding large populations of the species remain to be discovered in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Cambodia is likely to hold the largest population of any range state except perhaps Myanmar. Suitable terrain is widespread. Much of it is still forested, although ongoing clearance imuch of it is still forested rapid. North-east Cambodia, with various protected areas, may be particularly important, notably the protected areas of the 'Eastern Plains Landscape', in particular Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2014), as might be the ‘Northern Plains’ west of the Mekong (WCS Cambodia pers. comm. 2014). There are also records from gentle terrain around the Cardamom mountains (Holden and Neang 2009). The country’s population is not secure though and a possible, probably hunting-driven, decline has been noted for Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014). Large-spotted Civet was the third most commonly&#160;camera-trapped small carnivore species in the northern plains during the 2013–2014 dry season (Ai Suzuki pers. comm. 2014). Hunting, particularly snaring, remains relatively less prevalent in the Northern Plains than in other Cambodian protected areas, particularly those that border Viet Nam, e.g. the Eastern Plains Landscape, which includes Mondulkiri Protected Forest. It is plausible that the country’s most significant and important population is now in the Northern Plains (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Myanmar there are only a few records, from only a few sites (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Based on the extent of habitat on suitable terrain, many areas of habitat potentially suitable for Large-spotted Civet, including some large tracts, have not been surveyed by methodology appropriate to find the species (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Generalised trade-driven hunting for ground-dwelling mammals is generally less pervasive than in Vietnam and Lao PDR. In combination, these factors suggest that Myanmar might retain populations comparable to or exceeding those in Cambodia.<br/><br/>There seem to be only two series of recent records from Malaysia: these are from (i) two camera-trap stations in an oil palm plantation, and (ii) a road-kill record, all at the fringes of the Bintang-Hijau Range in the north-west of the country; the region is within the known range as clarified by Jennings and Veron (2011) (Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015).<br/><br/>As a ground-dwelling species, Large-spotted Civet is presumably readily snared. Thus, examination of markets is relevant to assessing the status of source populations. Despite the massive levels of non-specific hunting and of civet trade, and the often-taken opportunities to check large numbers of civets in trade, Large-spotted Civet has not recorded in the widespread trade in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) or Viet Nam, which suggests that the populations are already reduced to overall extremely low levels in these countries (S.I. Roberton, Wang Y.-x., Nguyen X.D. and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2006). Cambodia and Lao PDR both retain&#160;extensive (although fast-shrinking) degraded, heavily hunted lowland forest (large areas of Attapu, Salavan and Savannakhet provinces in Lao PDR, and of Kratie, Kompong Thom, and Stung Treng provinces in Cambodia) outside protected areas. The extent to which Large-spotted Civet persists&#160;within these non-protected areas is unknown. The insidious hunting throughout these landscapes (despite the occasional persistence of scattered populations of threatened species e.g. Eld’s Deer&#160;<em>Rucervus eldii</em>, White-shouldered Ibis&#160;<em>Pseudibis davisonii</em>), is likely to have caused declines in Large-spotted Civet as of most ground-dwelling mammals of similar and larger size. In addition, the widespread clearance of lowland forests for industrial agricultural concessions in Cambodia, both within and outside protected areas, will be reducing the extent of available habitat.<br/><br/>Throughout the twentieth century it is safe to infer an enormous decline in the species's global population, particularly in Thailand and Viet Nam, countries with large areas of suitable terrain which, during that century, were extensively converted to agriculture. This process proceeded somewhat later in the relatively smaller areas in Lao PDR. Cambodia has retained such a large proportion of the global total population in part by its large area of suitable terrain, but in particular because of the restraining effect of decades of civil unrest upon large-scale land conversion. With the stability since the late 1990s, such change is now proceeding apace. Similarly, Myanmar is emerging from a long period of international political sanctions that have held back finance for large-scale conversion of potentially suitable agricultural land; such activity is now gathering speed, particularly in the level lowlands (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, R.J. Tizard pers. comm. 2014). As well as habitat conversion, trends in hunting are relevant to inferring the population trend of this species. As a mobile (i.e. non-ambush predator) ground-dwelling species, Large-spotted Civet is presumably strongly susceptible to snaring. From the 1990s onwards, snaring levels have risen hugely across Viet Nam, Lao PDR and increasingly elsewhere, such as eastern Cambodia. While large areas of land in many range states have been declared protected areas, in most countries (notably excepting Cambodia) these are somewhat to greatly concentrated in hilly regions inimical to this species. Enforcement of wildlife laws is extremely lax in much of the species's range, and particularly outside high-profile protected areas. Thus, although there is no monitoring programme of this species directly, it is safe to infer from habitat and off-take trends that it has been in steep decline for decades and that this is ongoing.",Decreasing,"Large-spotted Civet has been found in southern China (e.g., Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010), Cambodia (e.g., Holden and Neang 2009, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2014), Lao PDR (e.g., Duckworth 1997, Austin 1999, Khounboline 2005), Peninsular Malaysia (e.g., Jennings and Veron 2011, Hamirul <em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015), Myanmar (e.g., Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008), Thailand (e.g., Lynam&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenks &#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and Viet Nam (e.g., Eames&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Nguyen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Roberton 2007). There was considerable confusion during the twentieth century about the southern extent of Large-spotted Civet occurrence, stemming in part from at least one author's treatment of <em>V. megaspila</em> and Malay Civet <em>V. tangalunga</em> as synonymous; Large-spotted Civet's documented range in Peninsular Malaysia is limited to the north-west of the country (Jennings and Veron 2011,&#160;Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015) and there are no records from Singapore (Chua <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>There are recent (post 1995) records from multiple localities in most range states, except for China, Viet Nam and Malaysia. In China the last record was in 1998 (Wang Ying-xiang pers. comm. 2006); Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) stated only that it might survive in the country. In Malaysia it has recently been found at only two localities, in the north-west and within the validated former range (Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015). In Viet Nam, apparently the only confirmed record since 2003 is&#160;of two captives&#160;photographed near Takou Nature Reserve (in which they were reportedly captured) in 2010 (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). The distribution in most countries is now patchy, reflecting its habitat use (see 'Habitats and ecology'&#160;section) and the heavy conversion of these habitats (see 'Threats'&#160;section).<br/><br/>It has been recorded from sea-level to about 800 m a.s.l., although it is very scarce above about 500 m and occurs predominantly below 300 m (see 'Habitats and ecology'&#160;section).","Much of the species's range, particularly Viet Nam and Lao PDR but increasingly other areas, has seen very heavy market-driven hunting using often non-selective methods such snaring. This is resulting in huge declines and, evidently, widespread local extirpations of many ground-dwelling mammals (e.g., Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, there has been an increased demand for civets as luxury food in Chinese and Viet Namese markets (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005). Although there has been no specific assessment of the extent to which Large-spotted Civet is taken, it is likely to be neither positively sought nor actively avoided. W. Chutipong (pers. comm. 2014) saw in an internet video of civet-coffee farming in Thailand a Large-spotted Civet; whether the animal was part of the coffee processing operations or was simply a quirky trophy-pet was not clear.",Terrestrial,"Large-spotted Civet has been found in many protected areas, particularly in Thailand and Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Most of these are not well managed, with some level of hunting, and many comprise largely unsuitable terrain and altitude for the species. Some of the PAs supporting it in Cambodia are afforded high ranking in conservation prioritisation, notably Mondulkiri Protected Forest, and Gray <em>et al</em>. (2010) called for Large-spotted Civet to be given specific consideration in management of this area. The species is nominally legally protected in most or all range states (excepting China, apparently), but these laws are widely flouted and over large parts of the species's present range have no deterrent effect on hunting levels. Recent great reductions in gun usage by civilians for hunting in Lao PDR and perhaps other countries have led to increased snaring efforts (in compensation); the latter is probably the more damaging form of hunting for this species (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The overwhelming need is to secure multiple protected areas across its range by reducing hunting and habitat encroachment to levels not detrimental to this species. A firm legal basis already exists to do this in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar. Such PAs should include Khao Ang Rue Nai WS and, perhaps, Huai Kha Khaeng WS, Thailand (the latter already one of the best-protected areas in South-east Asia; the former not), Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Preah Vihear Protected Forest (Cambodia), some in Myanmar (currently with too little information to decide which), and perhaps Xe Pian NPA in Lao PDR (although recent information is lacking and regional trends suggest it is quite likely the species will now be very rare there).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The major causes for reduction based on observed and potential levels of bycatch in gillnet and trap fisheries are known and management measures have been introduced to mitigate these impacts in parts of the species range, but declines have not ceased. Declines for four subpopulations range from 46% to 87% over three generations, and declines are inferred in other depleted subpopulations. A global assessment based on <em>ca</em> 48% of the species-wide pup production, suggests the species has declined by 57% in three generations. Australian Sea Lions should be classified by IUCN as Endangered under criterion A2bd.<br/></p>  <em></em>","Australian Sea Lions are sexually dimorphic, with adult males reaching 1.25 times the length and 2.5-3.5 times the weight of adult females. Very little information on sizes of adult males is available, and some values in the literature may be overestimates. Adult males reach lengths of 1.8-2.5 m and weigh 180-250 kg. Females are 1.3-1.8 m in length and weigh 61-105 kg. At birth, pups are approximately 60-70 cm long and weigh 6-9 kg (Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011). Pups are dark chocolate brown to charcoal in colour at birth and lighten to a smoky grey before becoming brown. The pelage pattern of pups up until their moult at around 4 months of age is highly variable.<br/><br/>Females become sexually mature at 4.5-6 years of age and males at six years or more. The mean age of breeding females is 11 years (McIntosh 2007). The oldest breeding female recorded was aged 24 years, while the maximum longevity recorded is 26 years for females and 21.5 years for males (McIntosh 2007). Age-specific survival probabilities are high (0.98) after six years of age and are similar for males and females (McIntosh 2007).<br/><br/>Australian Sea Lions are unique among pinnipeds, being the only species that has a non-annual breeding cycle, with intervals between pupping seasons of ~17–18 months (Ling and Walker 1978, Higgins and Gass 1993, Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2006, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Furthermore, breeding seasons are protracted in duration (4-9 months), and occur asynchronously across the species range (breeding can occur at any time of the year) (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2006, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Asynchronous breeding is maintained through extremely low rates of interchange between colonies by adult females, as demonstrated by genetic studies that indicate extreme population sub-structuring of mitochondrial DNA lineages (maternally inherited), even for those separated by short distances (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Goldsworthy and Lowther 2010, Lowther <em>et al</em>. 2012). The evolutionary determinants of this unusual reproductive strategy remain enigmatic (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009). Given the high level of genetic subdivision at the breeding colony scale, individual breeding colonies are considered subpopulations in this species (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lowther 2010, Lowther <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>The low synchrony of births within a breeding season requires males to mate-guard individual females until they come into oestrus around 7–10 days following the birth of the pup. Males are therefore sequentially polygynous, mate-guarding individual females until the male is compelled to go to sea and forage, after which he returns and repeats the strategy. Males defend their female(s) with guttural clicking, growling and barking vocalizations, posturing, and by fighting with rivals.&#160; Like most pinnipeds, there is a 4–6 month period of delayed implantation of the blastocyst following conception. This leads to a prolonged (active) placental gestation of up to 14 months, the longest for any pinniped (Gales and Costa 1997). The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is ~71 % (Higgins and Gass 1993).<br/><br/>Pups are continuously attended for the first 9–10 days after birth by their mother, after which adult females alternate between foraging trips to sea and nursing bouts ashore. Females nurse their pups for 15–18 months, usually weaning them before giving birth again, however females will nurse offspring for three or more years if they do not pup in the subsequent breeding season or their new pup dies. Adult female Australian Sea Lions behave aggressively toward pups that are not their own. Pups will play at the shoreline and in tide pools while their mothers are away, and following their postnatal moult, will actively swim on their own. Pups commence their own foraging trips at a young age and by six months can occupy part of adult female home range and explore adult foraging habitat at least eight months prior to weaning, allowing them to learn the location of suitable foraging habitat and the skills required to hunt successfully (Lowther and Goldsworthy 2012).<br/><br/>Australian Sea Lions restrict their foraging activities to continental shelf waters, with juveniles, adult females and adult males rarely exceeding depths of 90, 130, and 150 m, respectively (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010). The maximum recorded dive depth for an adult male is ~250 m (Goldsworthy unpublished data). The maximum recorded foraging ranges of juvenile and adult female seals are 118 and 190 km, respectively (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010). Adult males range much further and have been tracked up to 340 km from their colony. There is marked within and between-colony variability in the foraging behaviour of juveniles, adult females, and males (Goldsworthy <em>et </em>al. 2009, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010, Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011, Lowther <em>et al</em>. 2012). Foraging trips to sea are relatively short compared to other otariids (mean 1.1 day and maximum 5.1 days in juveniles; mean 1.2 day and maximum 6.2 days in adult females; mean of 2.5 days and maximum 6.7 days in adult males; Higgins 1993, Higgins and Gass 1993, Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011, Kirkwood and Goldsworthy 2013). Australian Sea Lions are benthic, diurnal foragers that routinely transit to foraging locations by swimming along the bottom and dive continuously while at sea and forage at all times of day (Costa and Gales 2003). During dives they minimize the time spent during the descent and ascent phases in order to maximize foraging time on the seabed. Individual dives rarely exceed eight minutes in duration enabling animals to perform around 10–11 dives per hour (Kirkwood and Goldsworthy 2013). Australian Sea Lions are fast, powerful swimmers and often “porpoise” out of the water when moving rapidly at the surface.<br/><br/>The diet of the Australian Sea Lion is poorly understood. Dietary information available is based on limited scat (faeces), digestive tract (autopsied dead animals), and regurgitate analyses (Gales and Cheal 1992, Ling 1992, McIntosh <em>et al</em>. 2006), some crittercam footage (Fragnito 2013), and analyses of prey DNA recovered from faeces (Peters <em>et al</em>. 2014). Cephalopods appear to be a key component of the diet, and include Octopus (Octopodidae), Squid (Loliginidae), and Cuttlefish (Sepiidae) species. Key fish taxa include Leatherjackets (Monacanthidae), Wrasse (Labridae), Flatheads (Platycephalidae), Perch (Sebastidae, Serranidae), Cods (Moridae), Mullets (Mullidae), and Nannygai/Redfish (Berycidae), Whiting (Siikginidae), Rock-ling, and Stingaree /Fiddler Ray (Urolophidae, Rhinobatidae). Small pelagic fish including Jack Mackerel, Yellowtail Scad, and Australian Sardine, have been recorded in the diet, but are not common (McIntosh <em>et al</em>. 2006, Peters <em>et al</em>. 2014). Crustaceans have also been recorded in the diet and include crabs (Stone Crab), prawns, and Rock Lobster (<em>Jasus edwardsii</em>) (McIntosh <em>et al</em>. 2006, Fragnito 2013). Crittercam data indicate that diet and feeding behaviour can vary markedly between individual animals (Fragnito 2013).<br/><br/>Predators of Australian Sea Lions include Great White Sharks (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2007) and presumably Killer Whales (Ling 2002).","<p>Although now protected, Australian Sea Lions have not rebounded fully in numbers or reoccupied all of their former range. A range of anthropogenic factors have been identified which may be impacting the recovery of the Australian Sea Lion (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, DSEWPC 2013). The cumulative impact of many of these threats may vary across the range of the species. Fisheries bycatch (especially in gillnets) and entanglement in marine debris appear to pose the greatest threat to the Australian Sea Lion at present (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2003, Goldsworthy and Page 2007, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010), while secondary threats include: habitat degradation and interactions with aquaculture operations; human disturbance to colonies; deliberate killings; disease; chemical pollution and oil spills; noise pollution; prey depletion and competition; and climate change (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, DSEWPC 2013). A substantial Sea Lion tourist industry has developed; this activity is regulated at Sea Lion colonies in parks to minimize disturbance during the breeding season.<br/></p>","Despite the large number of breeding sites (81) used by Australian Sea Lions, only seven sites produce more than 100 pups per breeding season, all of which are in South Australia. The average pup production per breeding site is just 40, with most sites (70%), producing fewer than 30 pups per breeding season (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, Goldsworthy unpublished data).<br/><br/>The species can be broadly separated into three main meta-populations: one in Southern Australia accounting for <em>ca</em> 84% of pup production; one on the south coast of Western Australia accounting for <em>ca</em> 10% of pup production; and one on the west coast of Western Australia accounting for <em>ca</em> 6% of pup production (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, Goldsworthy unpublished data). One very isolated breeding site at Twilight Cove in Western Australia lies 400 km distant from the nearest breeding sites to the east and west, and is considered an additional population.<br/><br/>Total pup production for the species currently is estimated to be 3,204; with 2,691 in South Australia, 335 off the south coast of Western Australia, and 182 off the west coast of Western Australia (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2011, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2013, Goldsworthy unpublished data). Pup production to total population multipliers developed for the species range from 3.83 to 4.08 (Goldsworthy and Page 2007, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010) giving a total population estimate of <em>ca </em>12,690 (range 12,290–13,090). Based on an age-structured model (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010), the number of mature animals in the population is ca. 6,500 (Goldsworthy, unpublished data).<br/><br/>Based on age-structure data that are available from one Australian Sea Lion population (Seal Bay, Kangaroo Island), generation time is estimated to be 12.4-12.8 years (Goldsworthy and Page 2007). Hence three generations is equivalent to <em>ca</em> 38 years.<br/><br/>Robust data on trends in pup production per breeding season (an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon) are available for a subset of subpopulations, mostly in South Australia. Pup production has declined for four main breeding subpopulations/regions: Seal Bay (~2% decline per breeding season or ~46% decline over three generations); nine subpopulations along the Bunda Cliffs (a 39% decline in mean maximum number of pups counted per site over 19 years, or ~64% decline over three generations); Olive Island (a ~8% decline per breeding season or 32% decline over seven years, equivalent to ~87% decline over three generations); and West Waldegrave Island (a ~42% decline in 10 years or a ~87% decline over three generations). Based on a global assessment of the species from data available for 23 subpopulations (accounting for ~48% of the species-wide pup production), total pup production has declined by 57% in three generations (Goldsworthy, unpublished data).<em><br/></em>",Decreasing,"<p>The Australian Sea Lion is endemic to Australia. Its extant breeding range extends from The Pages Islands (just east of Kangaroo Island) in South Australia to Houtman Abrolhos on the west coast of Western Australia. Pupping has been recorded at 81 island and mainland sites; 47 in South Australia and 34 in Western Australia (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2011, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2013, Goldsworthy unpublished data).<br/></p>","Australian aborigines have taken Australian Sea Lions for subsistence purposes for thousands of years. Early European colonists also took Sea Lions for food and other products, although numbers recorded in sealing logbooks were small (Ling 1999). Harvests by sealers in the 17th and 18th centuries reduced the population and extirpated them from areas around the Bass Strait and Tasmania. They are now protected by a variety of laws and are no longer hunted.",Terrestrial|Marine,"This species is protected in Australia by State Conservation agencies under numerous independently enacted state laws, the earliest dating back to 1889. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, 1999 provides protection for all pinnipeds in Australia. The Australian Sea Lion was listed as a Threatened species in the Vulnerable category under that Act in 2005. It is listed as a protected species (rare) in South Australia under the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1972. In Western Australia they are protected under section 14 of the Wildlife Conservation Act, 1950 and are listed as specially protected in Western Australia under the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected) Fauna Notice 2005.<br/><br/>Between 2010 and 2012, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) introduced a range of management measures into the shark gillnet component of the Gillnet Hook and Trap (GHAT) fishery to mitigate the impacts of bycatch mortality on Australian Sea Lion populations off South Australia (AFMA 2010). This followed research that integrated an on-board independent bycatch observer program on gillnet vessels, and an extensive Sea Lion satellite tracking and spatial modelling program (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010). The management measures introduced include spatial closures (most between 4–10 nm) excluding the fishery around all Sea Lion colonies off South Australia, and bycatch trigger limits that place a cap on the total numbers of Sea Lions that are permitted to be caught within areas of the fishery, which if exceeded result in extended (18 month) fishery closures (AFMA 2012). Given there is 100% observer coverage in this fishery, mostly through electronic monitoring, there is high compliance and most Sea Lion bycatch is now reported in fishery logbooks (AFMA 2013). Additional management measures, such as switching gear to hook and line, are being considered. Bycatch of Australian Sea Lion pups and juveniles in Rock Lobster pots has been largely mitigated through the introduction of Sea Lion excluder devices in the Western Australian and South Australian Rock Lobster fisheries.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The population seems to be stable in the upper section of the Río Santa Bárbara, including the spring and the subsequent Presa Santa Catarina, but stocks below the town are heavily impacted by water pollution. Though the species still seems to inhabit all known collection sites since the 1990's (Lyons 2011), a survey by Köck <em>et al.</em> in 2017 indicates that these stocks are threatened by declines.&#160;<br/><br/>The small EOO (25 - 70 km<sup>2</sup>) and presence at a single location, coupled with the decline in habitat along with AOO and EOO (an inferred due to ongoing decline in the lower portion of its distribution range), indicates this species is&#160;Critically Endangered.","The Presa Santa Catarina has an extension of 300 m x 100 -180 m; the average depth couldn't be ascertained, but might be deeper than 1.5 m. During a survey in 2017, Köck <em>et al.</em> documented this species from the upper part of the Presa. The water was about 50 cm deep, the ground made up of silt, mud and sand, with almost evenly distributed rocks and boulders. Those rocks were densely covered with green filamentous and short brown algae and aufwuchs. The shore was partly made up of riparian grass, partly building up dense vegetation growing in the shallow water or hanging over the surface. The Presa itself is bordered by walls forming a steep bank on the left side and a sandy-grassy shallow beach on the right hand side.&#160;The habitat was partly shaded by huge willow trees (<em>Salix </em>sp.).&#160;<em>Allotoca catarinae </em>was mainly hiding between the rocks or, more often, in the vegetation. The water parameters taken in March 2017 were: water temperature; 17.4°C; pH, 7.25; conductivity, 1,108 μS.&#160; Recent studies (Hernández-Chávez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) revealed a trophic level for this species of TROPH = 2.48±0.28, indicating that it is&#160;a carnivorous species. The only other fish species found at this collection site was another Goodeid, <em>Ilyodon whitei</em>.","The Catarina Allotoca is known from only about 20 km along the Río Santa Bárbara-Cupatitzio system and south of Uruapán. Waste waters from the town of Uruapán heavily impact on the river sections below the town, probably making parts of it uninhabitable. During a survey in 2017, Köck <em>et al.</em> were not able to find any fish directly below the falls of Tzaráracua, about 2.5 km southwest of Uruapán. The water had a bad smell and the surface was covered with foam. Downstream river sections might be in slightly better condition due to the cleaning possibilities of riparian vegetation, but suitable habitats might not reach further downstream than the power plant at Charapendo (Hidroeléctrica Cupatitzio) and the Presa de Jicalán (about 7 km south of the most southern known collection site). An expansion of turbid sections of the river can be observed, which will hinder the vision of this carnivorous species and, subsequently, its capacity to hunt for fry.<br/><br/>Besides water pollution, another threat comes from a trout farm in the Parque Nacional ""Barranca del Cupatitzio"" in the headwaters of the Cupatitzio river in Uruapán. Rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) are top predators in aquatic systems and escaped individuals constitute a threat for native fish. Though they would not be able to access the Río Santa Bárbara due to the above mentioned waterfall, the impact on stocks in the Río Cupatitzio would be dramatic and lead to a decline.","The population of this species is not particularly large at any of the collection sites, but has persisted everywhere since the late 1990's (Lyons 1990). Nevertheless, inferred from ongoing water pollution from the town of Uruapán and from observations (Köck <em>et al</em>. 2017), a the population appears to be declining south of Uruapán and possibly also in the Río Cupatitzio.",Decreasing,"The Catarina Allotoca is endemic to the Mexican federal state of&#160; Michoacán.

49318282,161463,Rhinoptera marginata,Critically Endangered,A2d,2021,2020-08-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Lusitanian Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera marginata</em>) is a large benthopelagic (to 200 cm disc width) ray that occurs in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, from Portugal to northern Angola. It is found from nearshore to a depth of 100 m.<br/><br/>The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawls, longlines, purse seines, and gillnets. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally and internationally as a dried and smoked or fresh and frozen product. This species forms large schools, meaning that large numbers can be fished in a single haul and there is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across its range, with demand for shark and ray product increasing.<br/><br/>It is apparently uncommon across most of the western and central Mediterranean but more common in the eastern region (Levantine basin), where there has been a long history of fisheries exploitation and which is ongoing. In West Africa, this species is still commonly caught in several countries, but significant population declines have been reported. In this region, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to steep declines in other large species of rays, and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been reduced in numbers in that area. Heavy fishing pressure has caused declines in other Rhinopterids.<br/><br/>Overall, fishing pressure is high and increasing across the West African range of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray and there has been a long history of fisheries overexploitation in the Mediterranean Sea part of its range which is ongoing. This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the continued targeted fisheries in several countries. The species is susceptible to fisheries, has schooling behaviour, limited productivity (one pup per year), and there are noted declines in other large rays (e.g., eagle rays) across its range. It is suspected that the Lusitanian Cownose Ray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (83 years) based on actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Lusitanian Cownose Ray is a benthopelagic ray that occurs inshore over sandy substrates in shallow bays, lagoons and estuaries, from nearshore to a depth of 100 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 200 cm disc width (DW),&#160;males mature at 64–77 cm DW and females mature at&#160;66–80 cm DW&#160;(Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Tirasin and Basusta 2018). Reproduction is&#160;lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of one pup, a gestation period of one year and size-at-birth of 23&#160;cm DW&#160;(Valadou&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Last<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016). There is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 7.5 years and a maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 14.3 years (Fisher&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The Lusitanian Cownose Ray&#160;has a larger maximum size than the&#160;Cownose Ray (200 cm vs 104 cm DW) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 27.5 years for the Lusitanian Cownose Ray. Cownose rays are among the least productive elasmobranchs with an  estimated intrinsic rate of population growth rates (r) ranging from 0.018 yr−1 to 0.032 yr−1 (median r = 0.008) (Grubbs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).","The Lusitanian Cownose Ray is captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including, gill net, trawl, trammel net, seine nets, longline, and hook and line (Schneider 1990). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted. Its schooling behaviour in shallow water makes it particularly susceptible to target fisheries (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). For example, inshore fisheries in Brazilian waters have driven the Brazilian Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera brasiliensis</em>) to local extinction, indicating that comparable fisheries operating in Mediterranean waters could pose a similar threat to the Lusitanian Cownose Ray.<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the Lusitanian Cownose Ray is sometimes landed in fisheries as bycatch. This water body has been subject to extensive and intensive fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution with trawl fisheries operating over a wide bathymetric range (50–800 m) and targeting a variety of species (Lleonart and Maynou 2003, Tsikliras <em>et al</em>. 2015). Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho et al. 2014, Kyne et al. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes as well as longlines and handlines (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, G.H.L. Leurs I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In Mauritania, the Lusitanian Cownose Rays was caught as bycatch in the 1990s and early 2000s during the 'courbine' (<em>Argyrosomus regius</em>) fishing season and, like other species of sharks and rays, was processed salted and dried (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). However, when an export market developed around 2007 with Spain, targeted artisanal fisheries for this species emerged. Fishers increasingly used drift nets to capture this species at known aggregations sites. Peak landings occurred between March and May, corresponding to the breeding season of females that were caught pregnant with near term embryos (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. For example, in West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries and destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016). <br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays and guitarfishes are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., for rice and salt production) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). For example, in West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","There are no species-specific trend data on the population of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray. However, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>First, in the Mediterranean Sea, this species is apparently rare in the western and central regions and was historically infrequently encountered off the coast of Dalmatia (Marchesetti 1882, Faber 1883) and sometimes observed in the fish markets of Mallorca in Spain (Barceló and Combis 1868). More recently, it was only recorded in two (in the eastern Ionian Sea) of a total 6,336 hauls in scientific trawl survey data from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) programme conducted between 1994–1999 at depths of 10–800 m (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). However, it was not recorded in trawl surveys in the upper Tyrrhenian Sea between 1972–2004 or in the Adriatic Sea between 1948–2005 (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2013). Within the Mediterranean Sea, even historically anecdotal evidence indicates that it appeared to be most abundant in the Levantine basin (Doderlein 1884). It is considered common off Israel and reported from Turkey, Syria, Cyprus, and Egypt (Dieuzeide <em>et al</em>. 1953, Bilecenoğlu <em>et al</em>. 2002, Golani 2006, Hadjichristophorou 2006, Saad <em>et al</em>. 2006, Basusta <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species has a schooling behavior and 129 individuals were captured (of which 36 females were gravid) in one purse seiner haul in Turkey in 2013 (Tirasin and Basusta 2018). The schooling behavior of this species, local declines of other Rhinopterids (e.g., the Brazilian Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera brasiliensis</em>) which has declined in southern Brazil as a result of intensive inshore fisheries) (Vooren and Lamónaca 2004), and the high levels of exploitation across the eastern Mediterranean suggest a population reduction in the Mediterranean portion of this species' range. <br/><br/>Second, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria, Mauritania, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. <br/><br/>Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly et al. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly et al. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to infer reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Fourth, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with population declines even though the Lusitanian Cownose Ray still occurs in landings across the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, targeted seasonal fisheries for this species have developed in the last 15 years to supply meat for local consumption and the export market to Ghanaian traders (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). While limited species-specific information is available, anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was historically abundant in many West African countries but that targeted fisheries and its schooling behavior has led to severe declines in quantities landed (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). This species was considered to be one of the most commonly landed species in Mauritania in early 2000 (Valadou <em>et al</em>. 2006). In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004–2006, this species was present in 0.8% of the total catches and contributed 0.1% in weight (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). In regular fisheries monitoring surveys undertaken by the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin, landings peaked at 1,104 t in 2012 but gradually decreased to 393 t in 2019 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). This decrease is the equivalent of &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray (83 years). Between 2004–2011, this species represented one of the most common species recorded in Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone during landing site surveys (Diop and Dossa 2011). In Senegal, large quantities are now only seen at trade centers in Casamance and are likely originating from various countries (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In The Gambia, this species was only occasionally recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 as single individuals or small numbers except on one occasion in 2015 where 961 individuals were recorded on drying racks in Gunjur and Ghanatown with less than 1% of this catch likely to be mature (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Guinea-Bissau (surveys restricted to Bijagos Archipelago), this species is still sometimes recorded in markets, however, it appears to only be captured in certain locations (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). It was also recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985–2012 but information on quantities is not available (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species has not been detected in recent surveys in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019, in Nigerian research surveys, during landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020, or in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (P. Doherty, K. Metcalfe, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species along with other Myliobatiformes (Duckbill Eagle Ray (<em>Aetomylaeus bovinus</em>), Whitepotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus narinari</em>), and Common Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis aquila</em>)), represented 0.01% of rays captured while it was rarely recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets (two individuals in Libreville in November 2018) (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). There, observers onboard industrial vessels report large quantities representing hundreds of individuals captured and covering the whole deck of trawlers in one haul (E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). In the Republic of the Congo, during surveys between January and December 2019, individuals were landed on a monthly basis but in low numbers (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). However, visits to landing sites in the past indicate that trawlers caught large quantities of adults of almost 150 cm total length seasonally (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). In Angola, there are no records from opportunistic landing surveys but fishers were able to recognize the species during interviews. They noted that they were common in the past (20 years ago) but had now become rare and when caught, they were only in small sizes while younger fishers (less than 30 years old) were not able to identify the species (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, fishing pressure is high and increasing across the West African range of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray and anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was historically abundant in many West African countries but has severely declined. There has been a long history of fisheries overexploitation in the Mediterranean Sea part of its range which is ongoing and population reductions are suspected. This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the continued targeted fisheries in several countries. Based on susceptibility to fisheries, its schooling behavior, limited productivity, and noted declines in other large rays (e.g., eagle rays) in general across its range, it is suspected that the Lusitanian Cownose Ray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (83 years) based on actual or potential levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Lusitanian Cownose Ray is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and occurs from Portugal to northern Angola (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020). It is not present in the Black Sea and has not been recorded from Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe (Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Cownose rays are generally caught as utilized bycatch of artisanal and industrial fisheries but are also sometimes targeted in West Africa for the trade in meat (Tagliafico <em>et al</em>. 2012; M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). It is of little commercial importance for human consumption in the Mediterranean region. However, in some areas of West Africa, the meat is utilised fresh, salted, dried or smoked for human consumption and also for animal feed (e.g., Ghana) (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). Since 2007–2008, an export market for fresh and frozen meat of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray developed between Mauritania, Senegal, and Spain which has led fishers in West Africa to increasingly target this species (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). In Mauritania, salted and dried wings are also exported to Central Africa by Ghanaians and Cameroonians (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across the range of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking this species are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of its range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>In West Africa, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

Consequently it qualifies as Endangered under criterion A2bcd. The status of this species varies in different parts of its range, but overall this decline is expected to continue in the future.","<p>This species is found in high-altitude cedar and oak forests, coastal scrub, and overgrazed rocky slopes with vestigial vegetation. It is confined to inaccessible rocky areas, gorges, and montane areas (from sea level up to approximately 2,600 m asl) due to habitat use conflicts with humans in more favourable areas. All the areas occupied by the Barbary Macaque are under growing pressure from human activity and habitat availability for <em>M. sylvanus</em> has decreased markedly in recent decades (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). <br/><br/>In Algeria, occupied habitats include mixed cedar (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>) and oak forests; Humid Zen Oak (<em>Quercus canariensis</em>) and Cork Oak (<em>Quercus suber</em>) mixes; Algerian Fir (<em>Abies numidica</em>), cedar and Zen Oak mixed forests; and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Taub 1977b, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Moroccan habitats include high cedar forests (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>), cedar/Holm Oak (<em>Quercus ilex</em>) mixtures, mixed oak forests (Qu<em>ercus suber, Q. canariensis, Q. ilex </em>and<em> Q. pyrenaica</em>) and cliffs and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Waters 2013). In habitats with cedar, macaques can reach densities of 25–40 individuals per km² or greater, whereas in habitats without cedar much lower densities of 5–7 individuals per km² are reported (Fa 1984). Densities in the mixed oak forests of Bouhachem Natural Reserve appear to be much higher than previously reported for the region (Waters unpublished data). In all occupied habitats, there is a species of oak available.<br/><br/>In Algeria, <em>M. sylvanus</em> lives in mixed-sex groups of up to 80 individuals with a modal size of 40 individuals (Ménard 2002). In Morocco, in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve, group size of four study groups was 52–73 with a mean of 62 (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Middle Atlas Mountains, group size ranged between 14 and 54 animals with a mean of 25 (Majolo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Life span in the wild is known to be up to 22 years (Lindenfors 2002). Females reach sexual maturity between 3.5 and 4 years of age and males between 4.5 and 7 years of age. In the wild, average age at first birth is 5.3 years for females (Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996; Lindenfors 2002) and the interbirth interval is 1.3 years (Taub 1974 in Fa 1984, Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996).</p>","<p>The destruction and degradation of the Barbary Macaque’s forest habitat is the most serious threat to the species. The severity of different threats varies in different parts of the species' range. <br/><br/>Severe habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation have been caused by domestic and industrial consumption of wood, use of fire, clearing for cultivation and overgrazing by sheep and goat herds (Taub 1977a, Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Ménard and Vallet 1993). This is exacerbated by poor forestry management; often <em>Cedrus atlanticus</em> is favoured and efforts are made to reduce <em>Quercus ilex</em>, but the latter species is a crucial resource for Barbary Macaques in some areas of their distribution (Ménard and Vallet 1986, 1996). In Morocco, severe habitat loss is also caused by extensive logging of cedar trees, occurring within and outside national parks (B. Majolo pers. obs. 2014).<br/><br/>As well as habitat degradation resulting from overgrazing by livestock is a major threat to the species (and a problem which is exacerbated by drought), in recent years, shepherds have increasingly settled near water sources. As shepherd tribes move into the forest, they often enclose open water sources with cement wells to be able to extract water for their herds. As a result, Barbary Macaques and other wildlife have been excluded from water sources in areas where it was previously accessible to them (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Conflicts with local people have been reported in Algeria, as a result of crop-raiding by macaques (e.g., villages in Djurdjura National Park in the Grande-Kabylie region: F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Crop raiding by Barbary Macaques has been reported by farmers in the area of Ouzoud (El Alami and Chait 2014) and other areas of the High Atlas. As a consequence, the shooting of Barbary Macaques as a result of crop raiding and cedar bark stripping was reported by Deag (1977) and must be seen as an ongoing threat to the species’ future.<br/><br/>In Algeria, national park officials indicate that the primary problem faced by Barbary Macaques is the conflict with mountain settlers, agricultural farmers and crop producers. Recently, regulation of forest use and access in Algeria has changed and it is now easier for people to use the forest areas. During the 1980s and 1990s, Algerians faced public curfews and restricted access to mountainous/forested regions due to civil war. Until recently, settlers were allowed to return to homes once occupied by their relatives in areas where Barbary Macaques are present. For example, in Chréa National Park, the human population increased from 550–600 individuals in 1993 to over 6,000 in 2015. Growth in human populations has resulted in a rise in infrastructure development in and around these areas, increasing the chances of macaque and human interaction through crop raiding, feeding interactions, as well as vehicle accidents (Benrabah 2015). Development of infrastructure has been shown to negatively impact wild macaques. For example, between 2008 and 2015, 31 incidents were recorded by park officials in Chréa National Park, including vehicle-related deaths of macaques (12 incidents) and 11 attempts of illegal capture of wild monkeys (Benrabah 2015). <br/><br/>The illegal live primate trade is also a significant threat to Barbary Macaques, as is their exploitation as photo props in tourist areas. Reports of capture for the international pet trade date back to 1977 (Deag 1977), and since then the trade has increased markedly (van Lavieren 2004). The Barbary Macaque was the most commonly confiscated mammal recorded by breeding programmes in European zoos between 2006–2010 (Zimmerman 2011). Infant <em>M. sylvanus</em> are offered both openly and covertly for sale on markets across Morocco, and prices of up to 200 Euros per animal have been recorded (van Lavieren 2004). Prices of about 100 Euros per animal have been recorded in Algeria, with Chaabet-el-Akhra gorges (Béjaïa) and Yakouren (Akfadou) cited as critical locations where illegal trade occur (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Additional threats include persecution, predation by dogs (Waters 2014), unmanaged primate tourism (Marechal <em>et al</em>. 2011, Borg <em>et al</em>. 2014), and pollution of the wadis (rivers) associated with forests (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Barbary Macaques seem to be rarely used for food, except as noted in some old reports in Algeria (Deag 1977).</p>","<p>In 1975, the Moroccan population of Barbary Macaques was estimated to be about 17,000 (Taub 1975). In Algeria, the population was estimated at 5,500 animals around 40 years ago (Taub 1977a). Alhough Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. (1999) estimated the species at around 15,000 individuals in 1999, this estimate was based on incomplete data.<br/><br/>Two population surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 at 23 locations in Algeria estimated the Algerian population to be 1,336–3,506 animals (Benrabah 2015, Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), representing an average population decrease of 50% in comparison to the last published survey (Fa 1984). Algerian subpopulations are highly fragmented (Fa 1984, Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). In 1999, just seven widely separated isolated populations existed, whereas 35 years ago they were found in at least six additional locations in Algeria (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). Currently, in Algeria there is a remaining isolated population in Gorge Chiffa and the Park National of Chrea (131–352 individuals) (Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). The populations of Djurdjura, Tikjda, Akhfasou, Bejaia, Gouraya, Yakouoren, Kherrata, Draguina, Taza, Ait Alouane, Guerrouch and el Babor are fragmented.<br/><br/>In Morocco, a number of surveys have documented marked declines in population density, along with losses of a number of sites (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999, Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). Fourteen isolated populations were identified in the High Atlas (Cuzin 2003). A recent survey in the Central High Atlas Mountains reported direct observations of 644 individuals in 23 groups with a mean group size of 21 individuals. However, irregular surveys over a long period may have resulted in an overestimate of the population (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The cedar forest area of the central Middle Atlas represents the largest refuge of the North African forest ecosystem. In the 1980s, it was estimated that 65–75% of the world's remaining population of <em>Macaca sylvanus</em> lived in this area (Camperio Ciani 1986). In the mid-1970s, population densities in the central Middle Atlas cedar forest were variously estimated at 60–70 individuals per km² (Deag 1974) or 43 per km² (Taub 1975). The most recent population estimate for the Middle Atlas is 5,000 macaques with densities of up to 23.4 individuals per km² (Menard <em>et al</em> 2013a). These data indicate that, in the central Middle Atlas, average population density is three times less than it was 30 years ago (<em>ca</em> 15,000; Taub 1977). In addition, Menard <em>et al</em>. (2013b) estimated that 46% of immatures were removed from macaque groups habituated for tourism in Ifrane National Park by poachers for the pet trade.<br/><br/>In the Rif Mountains, recent and current surveys are revealing that the populations are not as fragmented and low as previously thought. A recent survey has estimated a population of ~1,500 macaques in contiguous mixed oak forest in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve where there is very little poaching pressure for the pet trade (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>On Gibraltar, the population is maintained at <em>ca</em> 300 animals but now occurs in more and smaller groups. Some of these groups often range in built-up areas and have caused serious conflict with residents. One such group has been captured and sent to a captive collection in the UK (Waters 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Barbary Macaque is the only surviving primate in Africa north of the Sahara Desert, the only native species of primate to occur in Europe, and the only member of the genus <em>Macaca</em> that can be found outside Asia. In prehistoric times, this species inhabited Southern Europe and all of North Africa (Delson 1980, Camperio Ciani 1986). In historic times, it was widespread throughout North Africa from Libya to Morocco, but its current distribution is limited to small relict patches of forest and scrub in Algeria and Morocco (Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Scheffrahn <em>et al</em>. 1993, Menard and Vallet 1996). A semi-wild population lives in Gibraltar, which is a long established introduced population (Fa 1981, von Starck 1990, Hodges and Cortes 2006).<br/><br/>In Morocco, <em>M. sylvanus</em> is found in the Rif mountains (northern Morocco) and the Middle and High Atlas Mountains (central Morocco). More specifically, in Morocco the High Atlas populations (two anciently separated populations) are found from Demnat to El Ksba (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013) and around the Ourika Valley. In the Rif, Barbary Macaques are found in the protected areas of Bouhacham Natural Reserve, Talessemtane National Park, and Djebel Moussa (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Algeria, the species is found in the Tellian Atlas (Petite Kabylie and Grande Kabylie Mountains, and an isolated population in the Chréa National Park) in the north. From west to east, Barbary Macaque populations in Algeria are distributed as follows: Park National of Chrea (Gorge Chiffa), Park National of Djurdjura (Djurdjura and Tikjda), Park National of Bejaia, and Gouraya, Forests of Akhfadou, Yakouren, Gorges of Kherrata Forests of Draguina, Forests of Toudja, Park National of Taza (Ait Aloaune, Guerrouch and El Babor) (Benrabah, 2015). Additionally, a Barbary Macaque population might still occur in Djebel Bouzegza (Boumerdes, Grande-Kabylie) (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>The species occurs from sea level to 2,600 m asl (Cuzin 2003).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Macaca sylvanus</em> receives protection under national and international legislation, but law enforcement is inadequate. The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In 2000, the European Community suspended imports of <em>M. sylvanus</em> from Algeria and Morocco under the provisions of Article 4.6b of EC Regulation 338/97 because such trade was deemed to have a harmful impact on the species' status.<br/><br/>In both Morocco and Algeria, the national forestry departments are responsible for the management and the protection of flora and fauna. The Moroccan HCEFCLD collaborates with a Barbary Macaque conservation NGO to confiscate illegally-held macaques. The Moroccan NGO, Barbary Macaque Conservation in the Rif (BMCRif), has had success using social media to raise awareness among the Moroccan public who now regularly report illegally-held macaques in the Rif region, which are then confiscated by the forestry authorities (Waters and El Harrad 2013). The wildlife protection law in Morocco has recently been strengthened and confiscations take place more often. Some individuals are then released into the wild if they meet basic criteria. This strategy is successful for animals under one year of age due to the Barbary Macaque’s allo-parenting behaviour (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>With the rise in human presence and economic development in these regions, there may be an increase of fragmentation and separation, further isolating Barbary Macaques populations and preventing migration/dispersal (Benrabah 2015). However, with careful planning, the highly fragmented populations in Algeria could be reconnected via ecological corridors composed of forest patches, gorges, river basins and scrub regions. Ecological corridors are available for migration/dispersal of animals, provided the necessary actions are undertaken to protect those areas to assure they are suitable for the stable presence of macaques.<br/><br/>There has been some success recorded in Morocco with carefully-planned community projects; although crop raiding by Barbary Macaques does occur, community conservation activities are proving adequate to decrease human-macaque conflict in Bouhachem and persecution of the macaques by shepherds has ceased (Waters 2014).<br/><br/>A number of activities have been undertaken to increase public awareness and reduce illegal trade in this species. The Moroccan NGO BMRif collaborates with both regional and national forestry authorities to raise awareness about the Barbary Macaque including its status as a protected species. AAP (a Netherlands-based sanctuary for exotic animals) has initiated a project to combat illegal trade of Barbary Macaques into Europe, involving inter alia awareness raising among potential buyers, cooperation with authorities in consumer countries and training of customs officers in Spain (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006). The NGO Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation has trained local ecoguards whose task is to prevent attempts to capture macaques in Ifrane National Park for the illegal primate trade.<br/><br/>Most Barbary Macaque habitats in Algeria have national park status. Protected areas in Morocco harbouring populations of this species include the Toubkal National Park, Eastern High Atlas N.P., Ifran N.P., Talassemtane N.P., Bou Hachem Natural Reserve and Djebel Moussa SIBE in Morocco, and the Djurdjura, Taza, Chréa, and Gouraya National Parks in Algeria. However, the parks in Algeria and Morocco suffer from significant human impact, and these areas require much stricter protection than is currently in place.<br/><br/>In Algeria, there is increasing awareness of the importance of protecting Barbary Macaques. For example, managers of the national parks of Chrea, Djurdjura and Gouraya/Bejaia have recently started filling in systematic incident reports any time monkeys are observed being killed, injured or have disappeared as a consequence of human activity (Benrabah 2015). Such records give useful estimates of the type/intensity of threats faced by the monkeys. Although a trend of population decline in Algeria and Morocco has been documented over the last 30 years, the rate of decline has been lower in Algeria than in Morocco. Threats facing Barbary Macaques in Algeria slightly differ from those of the Moroccan population. Tourism impacts are less noticeable in Algeria due to the lack of development of a tourist industry. In addition, surveillance by military and policing authorities is comparably higher in Algeria, contributing to a lower risk of poaching and illegal trade. Habitat degradation and human conflict over agricultural habitats are the primary causes of macaque population decline. Access to mountain and forested regions has increased since the civil strife of the 1990s in Algeria, thus increasing competition between humans and macaques in relation to the use of habitats for agriculture, domestic herd grazing and garbage disposal. <br/><br/>The Moroccan High Commission of Water and Forests along with a Dutch NGO, Moroccan Primate Conservation (MPC), published an action plan for the Barbary Macaque in 2012, focusing on the population in Ifane National Park. In 2016, the Algerian authorities are organising an action planning workshop assisted by IUCN. The Moroccan NGO BMCRif will collaborate with stakeholders to organise action planning workshops in 2017 and 2018 for the Rif populations.</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Mediterranean

Subcriterion C1 requires an estimated continuing decline of at least 10% within the next three generations, or 42 years (14 years per generation for this species according to Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). As summarized by Dawson (2009), “Impacts over the last three decades have been severe and the population [of Chilean Dolphins] is substantially reduced.” Although there is reason to suspect that subcriterion C1 would be met, no estimate of decline rate is yet available. Therefore, the species continues to be best considered Near Threatened, pending better information on both population size and rate of decline. </p>  Bycatch is known to occur but the magnitude is unknown. Several additional threats have been identified, and the species has a restricted range with at least two genetically distinct subpopulations (Pérez-Alvarez <em>et al</em>. 2015). Therefore, it is urgent that range-wide research be conducted on the current status of this species. Re-assessment of Red List category should be a high priority once better information becomes available.","<p>The Chilean Dolphin is restricted to cold, shallow, coastal waters. According to Goodall (1994) it inhabits two distinct marine regions: (1) the channels from Cape Horn to Isla Grande de Chiloé and (2) open coasts, bays and river mouths north of Isla Chiloé. It seems to prefer areas with freshwater influence, rapid tidal flow, and shallow waters over banks at the entrance to fjords. The dolphins readily enter estuaries and river mouths.<br/> <br/> Most sightings have been near shore and therefore the Chilean Dolphin is considered a coastal species, although there has been little survey effort in adjacent offshore waters. Movements appear quite limited, with most dolphins resident in small areas. Individuals identified from natural markings on their dorsal fins have been shown to concentrate their activities in specific bays and channels (Heinrich, 2006). Where year-round studies have been conducted, Chilean Dolphins reside in the same inshore waters throughout all seasons (Heinrich 2006, Pérez-Alvarez <em>et al</em>. 2007). Groups tend to be small (between 2 and 15), but aggregations of 50-60 dolphins, likely representing temporary associations of smaller groups, have been seen along the open coast near the northern limit of the species’ range (Goodall 1994, Pérez-Alvarez <em>et al.</em> 2007). Although mixed groups of Chilean Dolphins and Peale’s Dolphins (<em>Lagenorhynchus australis</em>) have been observed, a clear pattern of habitat partitioning by the two species has been documented based on fine-scale environmental features, with Chilean Dolphins having a notable preference for proximity to rivers and areas of higher tidal flow (Heinrich 2006, Genov, 2012, Viddi <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2015) </p>  <p>Recent genetic studies (Pérez-Alvarez <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016) have shown that two distinct sub-populations exist: north of Isla Grande de Chiloé (northern coast) and south of Laguna San Rafael (southern fjords). This pattern is thought to be a result of post-glacial range expansion from a northern coastal refuge during glaciation into the southern fjords after the last glacial maximum<span lang=""EN-CA""> ~11,000 years ago (Pérez-Alvarez <em>et al</em>. 2016). Fine-scale genetic population structure remains unknown, but it is suspected that substantial structuring might exist between localised sub-populations in the southern fjords where the species seems to be more patchily distributed.</p>  <p>No systematic studies of diet have been made, but anecdotal evidence suggests that Chilean Dolphins feed on shallow-water fishes (<em>e.g</em>., Sardines, Anchovies, Rock Cod), cephalopods, and possibly crustaceans (Goodall 1994).</p>","<p>Chilean Dolphins were hunted for many years for food and crab bait in southern Chile (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994). Historically, fishermen in coastal areas north of Isla Grande de Chiloé harpooned dolphins or used those taken incidentally in their nets as bait for longlines targeting Róbalo (<em>Eleginops maclovinus</em>), individual hooks targeting Swordfish (<em>Xiphias gladius</em>), and ring nets for crabs (<em>Cancer</em> sp.) (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1988). From Isla Chiloé south, dolphins were used along with sheep, seals, sea lions, penguins, other marine birds, and fish for bait for the lucrative King Crab (<em>Lithodes</em> <em>santolla</em> and <em>Paralomis granulosa</em>) fisheries. In the early 1980s it was estimated that two Chilean Dolphins could be taken per week per boat at one cannery in Magellan Strait (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1988), and in 1992 up to 600 dolphins (including the more numerous and approachable Peale’s Dolphins) were harpooned per year in the area near the western Strait of Magellan (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994). Since then, alternative sources of bait (such as offal from the fishing and fish-farming industries) have become more readily available. The killing of dolphins for bait might continue to some extent but there is no reliable recent information on this issue. Although hunting of dolphins is illegal in Chile, enforcement of the law in remote areas is difficult and usually lacking.<br/> <br/> Incidental mortality in fishing gear is known to occur throughout the range, and particularly coastal gillnet fisheries pose potentially serious threats to local subpopulations. Unfortunately, no estimate exists of total incidental mortality in Chile. Historical data from one port south of Valdivia (Queule) showed that Chilean Dolphins comprised nearly half of the dolphins taken in gillnets set from some 30 boats (Reyes and Oporto 1994). This would imply a catch of some 65-70 Chilean Dolphins per year occurred at this one port (Goodall 1994). An unknown number of Chilean Dolphins are caught in intertidal gillnets set by local people from Isla Grande de Chiloé to capture small native fish and introduced farmed salmon that have escaped from their cages (Heinrich 2006). Such bycatch events are rarely reported, but for small resident subpopulations even a small number of incidental deaths could have substantial population-level consequences.</p>  Aquaculture farms for salmon and shellfish also may have negative effects on Chilean Dolphins, for example by restricting their movements and eliminating important habitat where farm densities are high, such as in the eastern Chiloé archipelago. Exclusion of Chilean Dolphins from bays and fjords is mainly a result of large-scale shellfish farming operations but also of salmon farms (Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2003, Heinrich 2006, Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2007). It has been shown that boat traffic, mainly related to aquaculture, affects the behaviour of Chilean Dolphins (Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2005). There is evidence that Chilean Dolphins are sometimes caught incidentally in nets set up around salmon farms to exclude sea lions in the southern fjords and channels (Francisco Viddi pers. comm., April 2007; Marjorie Fuentes pers. comm., March 2013).","The only reliable local abundance estimate is of 60 Chilean Dolphins in an area of approximately 270 km² off south-eastern Isla Grande de Chiloé (Heinrich 2006). The total population appears to be small (low thousands at most) although the perceived rarity of these dolphins may be due, to some extent, to the lack of observation effort and trained observers, and to the animals’ shyness and evasive behaviour. Chilean Dolphins are regularly seen and thought to be more abundant off Constitución (Maule River), south of Concepción (Golfo de Arauco), south-west of Puerto Montt, in the south-eastern Chiloé archipelago, in Laguna San Rafael, near Puerto Eden, near Puerto Natales, and west of Punta Arenas (Goodall <em>et al.</em> 1988, Gibbons <em>et al.</em> 2002, Heinrich 2006, Pérez-Alvarez <em>et al</em>. 2007, Viddi <em>et al.</em> 2010). They are not often seen in Chile's vast southern fjords (Gibbons <em>et al.</em> 2002, Dawson and Slooten 2008, Zamorano-Abramson <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Decreasing,"<a name=""_Hlk487956560"">The Chilean Dolphin is found only along the Chilean coast (and possibly in southern Argentina) from about 30°S to Cape Horn (56°S) at the southern tip of South America</a>. As is common for other members of the genus, it is found in shallow coastal waters, in particular close to estuaries and river mouths. It inhabits two different marine biogeographic regions: north of Isla Chiloé (42°S) it occurs along the exposed Pacific coast, and to the south it is seen in the sheltered waters of the archipelagos, channels and fjords of southern Chile (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1988). Few recent sightings exist south or east of Punta Arenas (53°S). Its distribution appears to be continuous but substantial genetic differences have been found between northern (open coast) and southern (fjord) subpopulations (Pérez-Alvarez <em>et al</em>. 2015). Unusual extralimital sightings of some individual Chilean Dolphins in groups of Commerson’s Dolphins (<em>Cephalorhynchus commersonii</em>) have been recorded in southern Argentina (Morgenthaler <em>et al.</em> 2014).","<p>This species was hunted mainly as bait for use in fisheries. This practice declined as alternative bait became available and there is no recent evidence to suggest that it continues. However, dolphins killed accidentally in fishing gear might still be used for bait.</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The Chilean Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.<br/> <br/> Better information on the status of Chilean Dolphins is needed, especially at the subpopulation level. The species may be declining because of bycatch and the consequences of extensive modification of its limited habitat in southern Chile. Specifically, it is important to obtain abundance estimates, quantitative information on incidental (and possibly direct) mortality, and better information on habitat use in relation to aquaculture and other human activities that may degrade or eliminate these dolphins’ habitat. The rapid expansion of salmon (and shellfish) farming southward in southern Chile is of particular concern. It is also important to evaluate possible gaps in the distribution of Chilean Dolphins to determine the conservation status of various subpopulations.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
50361589,11143,Lagenorhynchus australis,Least Concern,,2019,2018-07-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>There has been considerable improvement in the amount and quality of information about Peale’s Dolphin&#160;(<em>Lagenorhy</em><em>nchus australis)</em><em> </em>since the previous assessments in 1996 and 2008, both of which resulted in listing the species as Data Deficient. The currently available information is still somewhat limited making a rigorous evaluation against the Red List criteria challenging, particularly with regard to population size, trends, and threats. However, since the last assessment, abundance estimates have become available for the South Atlantic part of the species’ range indicating that Peale’s Dolphins number in the low tens of thousands (~21,800 combined point estimates for the Patagonian shelf and the Falkland Islands). Equivalent information for the South Pacific is not available. Based on existing sighting records, Peale’s Dolphins are the most frequently encountered small cetacean in the southern Chilean fjords. Overall, there is no evidence for significant population declines or high levels of anthropogenic mortality that might be cause for concern anywhere in the species’ range. There is reasonable evidence to suggest that Peale’s Dolphin is widespread, abundant, and not in decline in any major part of its range. Therefore, the species is assessed as Least Concern.<br/><br/>Further research is needed to obtain abundance estimates for the South Pacific part of the species’ range as well as more up-to-date quantitative information on human-caused mortality.</p>","<p>Peale’s Dolphins occur in coastal neritic (shelf water) habitats. In the South Atlantic they range widely over the Patagonian shelf from the wave-washed shoreline out to the 200 m isobath several tens of km offshore (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Dellabianca <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Tierra del Fuego and southern Chile, they inhabit deep channels and fjords, but are most frequently seen along the rocky shores rather than in the deep sections of the channels (Goodall <em>et al.</em> 1997a, Zamorano-Abramson <em>et al.</em> 2010). In the Chiloé archipelago Peale’s Dolphins prefer shallow waters (&lt;30 m) along more exposed shorelines or over shoals (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> submitted). Around the Falkland Islands Peale’s Dolphins are found both close to shore as well as offshore to the 100 m isobath (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2018). This wide range of neritic habitats suggests some degree of ecological flexibility.</p>  <p>The diet of Peale’s Dolphins is not well known, but stomach analyses from individuals in the southwestern South Atlantic identified mostly demersal and bottom fishes, and octopus and squid species (Schiavini <em>et al.</em> 1997) which commonly occur over the continental shelf and in kelp beds. Observational studies support the notion that Peale’s Dolphins strongly associate with coastal kelp beds (<em>Macrocystis</em> sp.) (de Haro and Iniguez 1997, Viddi and Lescrauwaet 2005, Viddi <em>et al.</em> 2011). Stable isotope analyses of dolphin bones suggested that coastal-benthic species such as zoarcids and nototheniod fishes and nearshore pelagic species (e.g., <em>Odonthestes</em> spp.) are important food sources for this species in Tierra del Fuego (Riccialdelli <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p>Over much of their range Peale's Dolphins are broadly sympatric with Dusky Dolphins (<em>Lagenorhynchus obscurus</em>) although their habitat usage differs sufficiently to provide some spatial separation (Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2010). The two species co-occur and sometimes form mixed groups in the Beagle Channel, at the southern extreme of the distribution of Dusky Dolphins (Dellabianca <em>et al</em>. 2018). Peale’s and Dusky Dolphins can be difficult to differentiate at sea (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a,b) leading to some uncertainty about species identification for sightings reported further offshore or from the extreme northern and southern parts of the range. Peale’s Dolphins frequently associate with other cetacean species, especially Commerson’s Dolphins (<em>Cephalorhynchus commersonii</em>). They are also known for their boat-positive behavior, readily approaching moving vessels to ride the bow wave (Cipriano 2018).</p>  <p>Limited evidence from individual identification studies suggests that some Peale’s Dolphins are resident in nearshore waters throughout the year, but some might also range widely alongshore (Lescrauwaet 1997, Heinrich 2006). Calves have been reported from spring through autumn, but population biology and dynamics remain poorly understood.</p>","<p>From the 1970s to the late 1980s Peale's Dolphins were hunted extensively with harpoons in the Strait of Magellan and around Tierra del Fuego, where the meat was used as bait in crab traps set for Centolla (Southern King Crab, <em>Lithodes antarctica</em><em>) </em>and Centollon (False King Crab, <em>Paralomis granulosa</em>) (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994, Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1994). Sielfeld <em>et al</em>. (1977) estimated that some 2,350 dolphins, including both <em>Peale’s </em>and <em>Commerson’s Dolphins</em>, were killed during the 1976/1977 crab-fishing season in the Strait of Magellan and the Chilean part of the Beagle Channel. This level of take across a number of years could have had a significant impact on the Peale’s Dolphin population in that area. Dolphin takes in the Argentinean sector were also significant (Goodall and Cameron 1980) but are thought to have stopped by the mid-1980s (Cipriano 2018). In Chile, exploitation for bait appears to have ceased later, by the mid-1990s (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994, Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 2008). However, some degree of uncertainty remains as alternative bait sources might not always be readily available, alternative bait prices fluctuate and official monitoring of bait usage and dolphin mortality remains sketchy (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 2008). Direct hunting of dolphins has been prohibited in Chile since 1977. Although all dolphin deaths in fisheries should be reported to the Chilean Fisheries authorities, this is not always the case. </p>  <p>Peale's Dolphins were reported to become entangled incidentally and drown in coastal gillnets along the open coasts of southern Chile and Tierra del Fuego, southern Argentina (Goodall <em>et al.</em> 1994, Reyes and Oporto 1994). In all areas, entanglement cases involving Peale’s Dolphins were reported less frequent than cases involving sympatric small cetaceans. There are no reports of incidental entanglements for the northern parts of Peale’s Dolphin’s Atlantic range (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1994) or in offshore trawl fisheries that are known to catch substantial numbers of other small cetaceans (Crespo <em>et al</em> 1997). Most of the entanglement information is now more than 30 years old, and current levels of bycatch of Peale’s Dolphins are not known. However, there do not appear to be particular fisheries or regions where they form a noticeable part of the incidental catch of small cetaceans. </p>  Other human activities with the potential to affect Peale’s Dolphins include the already large-scale and expanding aquaculture operations, particularly those involving farming of salmonids in southern Chile, and continued oil and gas development off southern Argentina. There is no information at present to consider if these industries are having substantial direct effects on Peale’s Dolphins, but their potential effects on the local ecosystem and the species that depend upon it mean that such activities should be monitored closely.","<p>The first abundance estimates for Peale’s Dolphins recently became available for the South Atlantic part of their range. Using density surface modelling with non-systematically collected vessel-based survey data gathered between 2009 and 2015, Dellabianca <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated 19,924 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) =0.2) to occur over the Patagonian shelf. The study could not account for the likely strong attraction bias arising from Peale’s Dolphins readily approaching vessels (i.e., possibly biasing estimates high) and also might have underestimated uncertainty. For inshore waters of the Falkland Islands, Costa <em>et al.</em> (2018) estimated 1,896 Peale’s Dolphins (CV=0.33) using design-based line transect methods and systematic aerial survey data collected in 2017. </p>  <p>No comparable abundance estimates exist for the South Pacific part of Peale’s Dolphin’s range. However, this species is reportedly the most commonly sighted cetacean in the Chilean fjords (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Gibbons <em>et al.,</em> 2002, Viddi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zamorano-Abramson <em>et al.</em> 2010). Although observed group sizes tend to be small (average number of individuals 4-5, range 1-15), the number of dolphins seen during boat surveys in the main navigation channels adds up to hundreds of individuals. Gibbons <em>et al.</em> (2002) used simple encounter rate measures to generate a crude estimate of around 2,400 individuals for the Magallanes region (49°-56°S). In addition, during the period 2001-2004 around 200 Peale’s Dolphins were estimated in the nearshore waters of southern and central Chiloé island (42-43°S) using photo-identification and mark-recapture techniques (Heinrich 2006). The species’ distribution and abundance along the open coast in the northern part of their range in Chile (Chiloé to Valparaíso) remain poorly known.</p>",Unknown,"Peale's Dolphins appear confined to shelf waters off southern South America, ranging from Valparaíso, Chile (33°S) south to Cape Horn (56°S) and along the Patagonian Shelf to northern Argentina (38°S) (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Cipriano 2018). Their South Atlantic range extends east to the Falkland Islands where the species is regularly observed near the coast. Peale’s Dolphins are also occasionally sighted over the continental shelf south of Cape Horn.","The Peale’s Dolphin was hunted for use as bait in crab fisheries (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994).

50659951,15955,Panthera tigris,Endangered,A2abcd; C1,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Tiger is listed as Endangered under criterion A2abcd. Comparing a breeding recent range estimate (42 “source sites” totalling 90,000&#160; km² : Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b) to a 2006 total range estimate (1.1 million km² : Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007) suggests a range decline much greater than 50% over the last three generations (7 x 3 = 21 years). As per IUCN guidelines (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2007, IUCN 2013), we calculated generation length at seven years based on approximate age of maturity (four years) plus half the length of the reproductive lifespan (six years) (based on Smith and McDougal 1991 and unpublished information). This decline continues and at least two of the source populations listed in Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010b) have apparently been lost (one from Lao PDR and one from Thailand). In 2006, it was believed that breeding populations existed in 13 countries, but now known breeding Tiger populations occur only in eight (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and Russia).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). A comparison of these population estimates of the 1990s (many with little scientific rigour) to similar current ones (many of better quality; see Table 1 in attached Supporting Material) suggests a decline of about 50% (taking the upper bound of 7,000 as the number of mature individuals in 1993, using a precautionary approach, declining to approximately 3,500 in 2014), but differences in methodologies and accuracy make such comparisons uncertain. This declining trend is likely to persist in the face of continuing threats such as direct poaching, prey depletion and habitat degradation which continue in all range states. Although several sites in India and Nepal have indeed reported recent recoveries, population reductions may not be reversible in other areas where Tiger habitat itself has been lost. Given the uncertainties about future declines, criterion A4bcd is no longer used.<br/><br/>The Tiger is also listed as Endangered under criterion C1 because the population of mature individuals may be fewer than 2,500 individuals. Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a estimated 2,154 tigers in 42 protected source sites where there is evidence of breeding (two populations are since known to have been lost, as described above), and the numbers in Table 1 (see Supporting material) could be overestimated. Generally Tiger status outside the source sites is poor and large breeding populations are unlikely to exist. To ensure tiger persistence, large population sizes (implying highest possible densities) and high survival rates of breeding adult females are critical. Although well-protected tiger populations may achieve recruitment rates that can sustain annual losses from mortality and emigration of 20% or more (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006), some theoretical models suggest declines to extinction when annual mortality of breeding females exceeds 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). For the purposes of Red List assessment, the estimated population in Source Sites is a good proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers. This population has declined by over 20% during the last two generations (14 years); the decline continues and may not be reversible in all sites.<br/><br/>Previously, Tigers were also listed under criterion C2a(i), but we have removed this criterion because the population in the Western Ghats in India has increased to &gt;250 adults (Karanth unpublished data). Other subpopulations in Terai, Central India, and Russia may also have &gt;250 adults (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>See attached Supporting Material for alternative depictions of range and population details.","Tigers are found mainly in the forests of tropical Asia, although they historically occurred more widely in drier and colder climes. One subspecies, the Amur Tiger <em>P. t. altaica</em>, persists in the Russian Far East. Photos of Tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the Tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the Tiger's diet, and in general Tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Tigers need to kill 50-60 large prey animals per year (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2013). Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines. Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (Water Buffalo, Gaur, Banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, like many large carnivores, preferred prey are key to successful reproduction and are those species that are approximately the same weight as Tigers themselves (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges. Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1–3 females, a common felid pattern of social organization. Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - e.g., female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at about 400 km² (Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Similarly, reported Tiger densities range from a maximum of 17-19 Tigers per 100 km² where prey are abundant (India's Kaziranga and Corbett National Parks) to as low as 0.13–0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2011, Soutyrina <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Poaching for illegal trade in high-value Tiger products including skins, bones, meat and tonics is a primary threat to Tigers, which has led to their recent disappearance from broad areas of otherwise suitable habitat, and continues at unsustainable rates. That there are roughly one million square kilometres of unoccupied Tiger habitat is a clear indication that poaching is the greatest threat to Tigers range-wide.<br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable Tiger populations. Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of Tiger habitat loss. With their substantial dietary requirements, Tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of Tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for Tiger conservation and can lead to high rates of retaliatory killing of Tigers. In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, about 40 people were killed by Tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh and India 2000-2010 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","The thirteen Tiger Range Countries came together in an unprecedented pledge to double the world’s Tiger population by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger on the Asian lunar calendar, with a goal of achieving at least 6,000 Tigers. This figure was based on a baseline global population of 3,200, agreed upon at a preparatory workshop held in Kathmandu, Nepal in October 2009; 3,200 Tigers was the IUCN Red List population estimate at that time. Since then, Tiger Range Countries have adjusted their baseline national Tiger estimates, finalized in the Global Tiger Recovery Program adopted at the International Tiger Forum in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010 (GTRP 2010).<br/><br/>The global Tiger estimate published in the 2010 Red List assessment of 2,154 tigers was an updated version of the estimate of Tiger numbers in source sites (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a). This was not a complete estimate of global Tiger numbers (for example, most Amur Tigers in Russia are found in unprotected areas), but justified because Tiger status outside the source sites is generally poor and poorly known. IUCN Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2010) define population as the number of mature individuals, defined as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction.” While in general this refers to all reproductive-age adults in the population, the Guidelines also “stress that the intention of the definition of mature individuals is to allow the estimate of the number of mature individuals to take account of all the factors that may make a taxon more vulnerable than otherwise might be expected.” Tigers require large populations to persist, and the survival rate of breeding adult females is a key parameter, with models suggesting population declines when mortality of breeding females rises over 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). The IUCN Guidelines advise that “mature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted.” Thus, for the purposes of the Red List assessment in 2010, the estimated population in the Source Sites was used as a proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers.<br/><br/>Due to extensive surveys using improved methodologies since this analysis, our understanding of tiger distribution and numbers is much improved, e.g., extensive camera trapping in Bhutan has demonstrated significant populations. Further, Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010a) ignored some important Tiger areas, e.g., thousands of square kilometres in Kerinci and Leuser National Parks known to contain breeding Tiger populations.&#160; Hence, the current estimate of 3,159 Tigers (Table 1 in supplementary material) is based on data collected in scientific surveys conducted over the past five years (i.e. since 2009). This is a minimum estimate because some important areas (e.g. the Russian Far East) did not have current estimates. However, because of differences in methodology, this can by no means be interpreted as an increase over the 2010 estimate of 2,154. Rather, it is a more complete counting. While Tiger numbers have increased in some areas in India (e.g. Western Ghats, Central India, and Corbett Landscapes in India), they have also declined in key areas, especially in mainland SE Asia (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey in Lao PDR is no longer considered a potential source site).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated, less rigorously, at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although to some extent the new numbers represent improved knowledge, it is clear that there have been substantial population declines, with Tigers all but eliminated from much of their recent forest range, particularly in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>See the supplementary material for further information about national Tiger population estimates.",Decreasing,"The Tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Over the past 100 years Tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Tigers inhabit less than 6% of their historic range (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006, Walston <em>et al.</em> 2010b), with a 42% decline since 2006. Breeding populations of Tigers are currently found in eight range states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, and Thailand. There is evidence of breeding in China and Myanmar between 2009 and 2014, though these populations are likely dependent on immigration from neighbouring countries. Tigers may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence.<br/><br/>In 1994, the first comprehensive assessment to delineate Tiger range was carried out (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997). Priority areas for Tiger conservation were estimated to total 1.64 million km² in 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations, not including Russia (later estimated at 270,0000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006) and China. While this was generally considered representative of current distribution, Tiger presence was confirmed in just 47% the TCUs, and 89% were scored as undergoing medium to high levels of poaching of Tigers and their prey.<br/><br/>This exercise was revised and updated ten years later, and in delineating Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs), greater emphasis was placed on actual records of Tiger presence and breeding (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). TCLs were defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five Tigers, and Tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade. Tiger range was estimated at 1.1 million km² in 76 TCLs (again, roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations). This represented a 41% decline from the range described a decade earlier (in South and Southeast Asia, a drop from 1.55 million km² to 914,000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63), attributed primarily to poaching pressure (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007). Habitat loss due to deforestation was also to blame, notable particularly in Sumatra and Myanmar (Wikramanayake <em>et al</em>. 2010). In India, landscapes with Tigers found to be much smaller and more fragmented than in the original assessment (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63 and Figure 4.12).<br/><br/>Records of Tigers were collected over a ten-year period (1995–2004), a period which may have been too liberal for places like Cambodia which underwent a sharp rise in poaching pressure in the 1990s (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Appendix 6). While 53% of the TCU survey respondents reported evidence of Tiger breeding in the time period 1995–2004, out of over 2,500 point records collected in 2005, just 8% had confirmed evidence of breeding Tigers (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 11-17). Large areas of habitat were defined as Tiger landscapes based on suitability, but given data paucity on Tiger presence there were often few records of breeding and actual Tiger occupancy to substantiate these (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Figures 2.3 and 4.8).<br/><br/>A review of land management within Tiger Conservation Landscapes described the TCLs as “potential habitat for Tigers” and found only 21% of their area to be legally protected.&#160; Management effectiveness was generally poor in the protected areas, with regulatory, budgetary and enforcement constraints, and hunting cited as the main threat. Significant portions of the TCLs are designated concessions for resource extraction (timber, oil and gas, minerals, etc.) (Forrest <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Tiger range was revisited again in 2009, by which time the extent of the Tiger’s range collapse had become evident. “Vast areas of Southeast Asia [were] recently found to be void of Tigers and depleted of prey by hunters” (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a: 5). The exercise used a different methodology to prioritize areas for Tiger conservation.&#160; Source Sites were defined as areas with confirmed current presence of Tigers and evidence of breeding, population estimates of &gt;25 breeding females, legal protection, and embedded in a larger habitat landscape with the potential to hold &gt;50 breeding females. An extensive review of scientific literature as well as correspondence with Tiger scientists and protected area managers resulted in the identification of just 42 source sites totalling approximately 90,000 km².&#160; Many Southeast Asian countries, previously considered to have large areas with Tigers, were found, on the basis of extensive survey effort over the past decade or more, to have no healthy breeding populations. Since this publication, Lao PDR has lost its only source site, but Bhutan, originally listed as a country not containing source sites, has documented breeding populations. [See Figures 1 and 2 in supplementary material].<br/><br/>The map for this effort (Figure 1 in supplementary material) differentiates areas where breeding has been detected in the past five years (2009-2014), where Tigers, but no breeding have been detected in the past five years, areas surveyed where no Tigers were detected and areas not surveyed.&#160; Data include camera trap photos, DNA, and observations of Tigers and Tiger sign detected during scientific surveys.&#160; Unsurveyed areas were excluded from Tiger range.&#160; Figure 2 (attached Supporting Material)&#160; documents a 42% range decline since 2006, reflecting both real decline and improved knowledge from new and better surveys.","In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of Tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the Tiger to extinction (Nowell 2000). Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell 2007). Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu 2007). Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of Tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell 2007). In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of Tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching over 6,000. They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce Tiger products, and several have already engaged in illegal production of Tiger bone wine. Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of Tiger bone has decreased since China banned Tiger bone in 1993. Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu 2007). In 2008 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) adopted a Decision stating that “Tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives” (CITES 2008).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for Tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure. But many Tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock. Conflict-killed Tigers can also feed into the illegal trade. Many Tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger poaching is driven by less by poverty and more by wealth (TRAFFIC 2008), which is putting expensive illegal Tiger products within reach of a rapidly growing group of potential consumers. TRAFFIC has documented rising levels of recent illegal trade within the Tiger range countries, with seizures and confiscations in 2007–2009 averaging the equivalent of approximately 150 Tigers per year (Verheij <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Interdictions represent just a fraction of the true level of illegal trade, indicating that Tigers are gravely imperilled by black market demand.",Terrestrial,"At a “Tiger Summit” held in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010, the 13 Tiger Range Countries adopted a Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP 2010). The goal is to effectively double the number of wild Tigers by 2022 through actions to: <br/>i) effectively preserve, manage, enhance and protect Tiger habitats; <br/>ii) eradicate poaching, smuggling and illegal trade of Tigers, their parts and derivatives; <br/>iii) cooperate in transboundary landscape management and in combating illegal trade; <br/>iv) engage with indigenous and local communities; <br/>v) increase the effectiveness of Tiger and habitat management; and <br/>vi) restore Tigers to their former range. <br/><br/>The Tiger Summit was attended by Heads of State including Russia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Bangladesh, and represented significant government commitment to Tiger conservation.<br/><br/>The future of Tiger range depends upon the Asian governments creating effective Tiger landscapes by conserving large areas of suitable habitat. Within these landscapes, the most urgent need is to first secure the source sites—protected areas with viable Tiger populations—where most of the global Tiger population is now clustered, and many of which are currently too threatened to deliver their potential as the demographic sources for species recovery (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b).<br/><br/>Countries that do not currently support known breeding populations (Myanmar, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR) but still have large landscapes with suitable habitat, Tigers might still be recovered if government commitment to Tigers, staff capacity for law enforcement and legal frameworks for Tiger protection can be established (Lynam 2010), though reintroduction may be needed in some places.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50662095,18148,Prionailurus planiceps,Endangered,C1,2015,2014-05-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Flat-headed Cat has a restricted and patchy distribution around wetlands in lowland forest on the islands of Sumatra, Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula. It was formerly also distributed in southern Thailand but the last confirmed observation was almost 20 years ago (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010). Current status distribution is limited to presence data, and there are few records in comparison with sympatric small felids. The extent to which this reflects patterns of survey design and effort rather than patterns of distribution is unclear. Wetland destruction and degradation and the very high deforestation rate in southeast Asia is the primary threat faced by the species (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010). Since 2010 there have been few new photo captures of this species with camera traps. The reason for this can be due to the special wetland-based ecology of the species, but as they have been previously photographed on main roads, as well as in the forest and along trails, it is believed unlikely to be the sole reason. It was photographed only a few times in the Kinabatangan area of Sabah, of Borneo (an area thought to have the best habitat for the species), despite hundreds of camera traps (A. Hearn pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Over 45% of protected wetlands and 94% of globally significant wetlands in Southeast Asia are considered threatened (Dugan 1993) and although the situation today is unknown, it is unlikely to be radically better and may be much worse. Causes include human settlement, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid. While there have been observations of the Flat-headed Cat in secondary forests (Bezuijen 2000, Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mohamed <em>et al</em>. 2009), Wilting <em>et al</em>. (2010) could not find any support that the Flat-headed Cat can also live in oil palm plantations. According to their distribution model, over 70% of its predicted historical suitable habitat has been transformed to unsuitable habitats (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010). Between 2000-2010 the Flat-headed Cat lost over 20% of potentially suitable habitat (10% in Peninsular Malaysia, 17% in Borneo and 41% in Sumatra; extracted from Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011). Based on these rates of habitat loss and together with other threats such as pollution of wetlands and hunting it is very likely that the Flat-headed Cat population declined by at least 20% in the last 12 years (two generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) and will also continue to decline over the next 12 years by more than 20%.<br/><br/>It is difficult to estimate population size given its patchy distribution and lack of any density estimates. However the low number of camera-trapping records and direct sightings compared to other Southeast Asian cat species seem to support the notion that the Flat-headed Cat is very rare and/or very specialized in its habitat requirements. An area of occupancy map predicted a species distribution area of about 61,000 km² for Borneo (Wilting <em>et al</em>. unpublished data of the Borneo Carnivore Symposium). For Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra we inferred that additional 10,000 km² and 8,100 km², respectively, could be occupied. If we take a density of four individuals per 100 km² within this 80,000 km², and assuming that not all individuals of a population are mature individuals we would infer a population size which is plausibly fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. For the Flat-headed Cat with its very patchy distribution and its close associations to water resources the average density of four individuals per 100 km² is rather conservative, although in some well suitable areas the density might also be much higher than this. Using a higher average density (&gt;5 mature individulas per 100 km²) would lead to population estimates which would qualify the species as Vulnerable (C1). The IUCN Red List Guidelines (vers. 11, Feb 2014) caution that multiplying density times area extent often leads to “gross overestimation” of the number of mature individuals. Although density estimations of Flat-headed Cats would be needed to verify the inferred numbers, the great threat to Southeast Asian wetlands further supports the classification as Endangered under the precautionary principle.<a name=""_GoBack""></a>","Very little is known about this species, and the available information suggest that, like its close relative the fishing cat, the Flat-headed Cat is strongly associated with wetlands and preys primarily on fish. Stomach contents of two dead animals contained mostly fish, and also shrimp shells. They may also take birds and small rodents, and have been reported to prey on domestic poultry (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/> <br/> Most records for the Flat-headed Cat are from swampy areas, lakes and streams, and riverine forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yasuda <em>et al.</em> 2007). They also occur in peat-swamp forest (Bezuijen 2000), and have been observed in secondary forest (Bezuijen 2000, Bezuijen 2003, Meijaard <em>et al.</em> 2005, Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2009). All published observations of live animals have taken place at night or early morning, near water (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Bezuijen 2000, Bezuijen 2003, Meijaard <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yasuda <em>et al.</em> 2007). Over 80% of the records gathered by Wilting <em>et al.</em> (2010) were from elevations below 100 m asl, and over 70 % were recorded within a distance of three km to larger water sources. <br/> <br/> The Flat-headed Cat takes its name from its unusually long, sloping snout and flattened skull roof, with small ears set well down the sides of its head. It has large, close-set eyes, and relatively longer and sharper teeth than its close relatives. Its claws do not fully retract into their shortened sheaths, and its toes are more completely webbed than the Fishing Cat's, with long narrow foot pads. Muul and Lim (1970), commenting on the cat's feet and other features, termed it the ecological counterpart of a semi-aquatic mustelid.","<p></p><p>Wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation is the primary threat faced by the species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010). Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid in Tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments and is likely to be a significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat (Wilting <em>et al. </em>2010). Trapping, snaring and poisoning are also threats: E. Bennett (in Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) reported that skins were frequently seen in longhouses in the interior of Sarawak, and the Flat-headed Cat has been captured in traps set out to protect domestic fowl (Nowell and Jackson 1996).</p>","<p></p><p>The Flat-headed Cat is closely associated with wetlands and lowland forests, habitats which are increasingly being occupied and modified by people (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010).

Although fishermen along the Merang River in south Sumatra (which has relatively intact peat forests) described it as common (Bezuijen 2000), they tend to use a single generic term for both Flat-headed Cat and Leopard Cat <em>Prionailurus bengalensis</em>, a more abundant species (Bezuijen 2003). Most of the recent records come from Sabah in northeastern Borneo, where it can be frequently be observed along the Kinabatangan River (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010), and where it has been several times recorded by camera-traps in Deramakot and Tangkulap Forest Reserve (Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2009). Recently camera-trapping records come from a mixed-used plantation area, which includes conservation reserves within the oil palm estates in East Kalimantan (Wahyudi and Struebing 2013) and from Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia (Wadey <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"The Flat-headed Cat has a restricted distribution, found only on Sumatra, Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula (Malaysia and extreme southern Thailand).

50662615,18150,Prionailurus viverrinus,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2016-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Recent surveys suggest that Fishing Cat populations are still in decline within all range countries at an alarming rate, particularly in Southeast Asia. A severe paucity of recent records in Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Java, and, if the species occurs there at all, Lao PDR, indicate that these populations are very small, and have been since at least 2000. There are no recent records from Sumatra (Indonesia), where the species has never been confirmed to occur, although in the light of only limited appropriate survey effort in these areas, the species’s current status should be considered unknown. In South Asia, although relatively widespread, it occurs largely in human-dominated landscapes (often hugely so), which are under locally severe threat from urbanization (Sri Lanka and India) and industrialization (India). Estimates of population size and trend, and of extents of habitat, are very speculative, given that research on this species has been initiated only in 2009 (Cutter 2015). Yet, research reveals a declining population facing an array of severe threats from habitat destruction to active persecution due to perceived conflict (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Cutter 2015, Adhya 2016). Poaching and retribution killing were the major causes for a high Fishing Cat mortality of 84% in Thailand, where 16 individuals have been monitored over a three-year radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015). <br/><br/>The current known global Fishing Cat strongholds are Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Bengal in India and the Terai-Duar belt of the Himalayan foothills in India and Nepal. Habitat loss along with the killing of Fishing Cats because of conflict with local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside these strongholds, declines may be considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal are likely in the next 15 years (Ashan Thudugala, Anya Ratnayaka, Tiasa Adhya, Shomita Mukherjee, Murthy Kantimahanti, Giridhar Malla, Rama Mishra, Sagar Dahal pers. comm. 2015). These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a decrease of a further 30% in the global Fishing Cat population. Thus, the species is categorized as Vulnerable under A2cd+3cd+4cd. <br/><br/>The change in Red List category is a non-genuine change reflecting the very recent increase in information quality; it does not indicate an improved conservation status for the species since the last assessment.","In India the Fishing Cat is strongly associated with water bodies, marshlands constituting tall bed-forming graminoid species like the reed <em>Phragmites vallatoria</em>, the reedmace <em>Typha elephantina</em> and locally cultivated grass species like <em>Saccharum narenga</em> and swamps (Adhya 2015). Most known records are from the lowlands, but in Sri Lanka Fishing Cat occurs also in wetlands in hilly areas (Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is largely nocturnal (Mukherjee 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). It is a dietary generalist consuming a variety of prey such as murid rodents, birds and fish (Mukherjee 1989, Haque and Vijayan 1993, Adhya 2015). Two species of rodents that figured prominently in the diet of the Fishing Cat from the Howrah district of West Bengal, a rapidly developing urbanised zone, were <em>Rattus rattus</em> (sensu lato) and <em>Bandicota bengalensis</em>. A conservative estimate of rodent consumption by the Fishing Cat suggests that each individual eats between 365 and 730 rodents per year (Adhya 2015).<br/><br/>A radio-telemetry study on four Fishing Cats in Chitwan National Park in Nepal showed that they mostly used dense tall and short grasslands; the home ranges of three females was estimated at 4-6 km² while that of a single male was estimated at 16-22 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A more recent radio-telemetry study in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, demonstrated that protection of resources such as food and daytime resting sites and reduction of poaching can ensure the persistence of the Fishing Cat in human-modified agricultural areas (Cutter and Cutter 2009). A 84% mortality of radio-collared cats, due to poaching and unknown causes, was reported during the three-year study (Cutter 2015).<br/><br/>Generation Length (GL) was estimated at 5 years, using the Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) formula, GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], [where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3]; Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR), assuming 12 years as the average life span of the Fishing Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year.","The Fishing Cat faces a high risk of extinction throughout its range and is thought to be amongst the most vulnerable of the small and medium-sized cats in Southeast Asia, reflecting the very low overlap of occupied habitat with protected areas and other conservation interventions, rather than any particular inherent higher susceptibility than shown by the other small cats (e.g. Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The major threat across its South Asian range appears to be habitat loss and fragmentation by developmental activities such as urbanization, industrialization, agriculture and aquaculture (prawn and shrimp farms), whereas in Southeast Asia persecution is the major threat (Melisch <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Willcox <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, Cutter (2015) reported 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats during the study period. Of 16 Fishing Cats that were radio-collared, three could not be located and could have either dispersed or died. Of the remaining 13, only two survived the almost three-year study period while five were poached and six died of unknown causes. Five dead cats were located. In one case the poacher who shot an animal reported the cause of death when he returned its ear tag. &#160;<br/><br/>In India, much of its habitat comprises freshwater marshlands which are categorised as ‘wastelands’ under land use policies and are thus subject to conversion and degradation (Adhya 2015). Linked to this is conflict with humans, which is believed to be aggravated by habitat fragmentation and sharing of resources such as space (wetlands) and food (fish, goats, poultry) (Melisch <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Kolipaka 2006, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). Poisoning, trapping and clubbing seem to be common methods to kill Fishing Cats across the species’ range. A survey in West Bengal recorded 27 deaths of Fishing Cats between April 2010 and May 2011 in that year in the Howrah district (1,600 km²) (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In Bangladesh, a compilation of reports from newspaper articles and web-based searches on the Fishing Cat (deaths, captures, rescues and releases) revealed 82 records and 30 confirmed deaths over a three-year period from January 2010 to March 2013 (Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In both areas, almost all deaths could be traced to local people killing the cats (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). It should be taken as the minimum number killed because not all instances are recorded. In the Sundarbans of India, local people from Sagar Island admitted to having exterminated the cat from their island (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2015) noted that in Bangladesh and India more than 70% of the deaths occurred during the dry season, perhaps when Fishing Cat and human resources overlap maximally. A recent study (Adhya 2015) in the Howrah district of West Bengal reveals that Fishing Cat diet is largely composed of small mammals, fish and birds with a negligible portion (less than 5%) comprising of livestock and surmises that the killings are based on a perception of conflict because of the presence of the cat.<br/><br/>In Cambodia the Fishing Cat is killed by locals for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Such killings probably occur throughout its Southeast Asian range.","Fishing Cat populations and habitat in Southeast Asia are severely stressed and the species’ current stronghold is in eastern and southern parts of South Asia. According to Melisch <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1996), in West Java, Fishing Cat populations were fragmented and restricted to coastal areas. However, this was in the 1990s and the evidence was based solely on visual identification of tracks and scats, which may not be reliable; the last photographic evidence of the species in the wild on Java dates to 2000 (A. Compost <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2012). The Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016). It is unclear the extent, if any, to which these surveys covered microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat. In sum, it is impossible to speculate on current population size in Java, if the species even survives there at all. In Viet Nam the species is perhaps extinct in most or even all of its former range but it was confirmed to persist in the Mekong Delta until at least 2000 (Willcox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). It is not known if it ever occurred in the Red River Delta; given general levels of hunting and persecution in the country it seems unlikely that any large population remains anywhere in Viet Nam (Daniel Willcox <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). <br/><br/>In Thailand too, the species seems to be highly localised and recent surveys and incidental records suggest that it is restricted to coastal parts of Central and Southern Thailand (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Buatip <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Tantipisanuh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). There is at least one historical Thai specimen identified as this species from well inland (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010), but the extent to which the species ever occurred widely across inland Thailand, if at all, remains unclear. Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, coastal Thailand, (Cutter 2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats due to poaching and unknown causes over her three-year study period.<br/><br/>Its presence in the Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar was recently confirmed (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2016), but there is no indication of the population size there, although given the extent of the habitat it could be large. <br/><br/>Extensive camera-trapping in the general area of the only historical locality record from Myanmar, the Hukaung Valley, did not find the species, but camera-traps were not set to target this species, so it is unclear whether it persists there (Than Zaw <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South Asia, the Fishing Cat is currently widespread in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The Pakistan population of Fishing Cat was feared to be close to extinction (Roberts 1977), but there are camera-trap records of Fishing Cat from the Chotiari Reservoir in the Sindh Province of Pakistan (Islam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015) and recent reports of individuals being sold in local markets in Karachi (Faraz Zubairi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). In Sri Lanka and in India there are small populations of Fishing Cat in densely human-populated urban areas (Adhya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Ratnayaka 2016). In Nepal it occurs along a narrow stretch bounding India, in the Terai region (Sagar Dahal <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). It seems to be relatively safe in some protected areas in India, especially those under the Project Tiger scheme, such as Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, at the Indo-Nepal border and the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve bordering Bangladesh. In Bangladesh the Fishing Cat seems to be relatively safe in mangrove forests of the Sundarbans and in the north-eastern swamps (Rahman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). However, on both sides of the India-Bangladesh border, very few surveys have been undertaken to assess the status and distribution of the Fishing Cat across the salinity gradient of the mangrove region.<br/><br/>A molecular analysis of population connectivity in India suggested that in the past Fishing Cat populations within India were connected from the Terai region of the Himalayan foothills to the Coringa mangroves in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). However, this analysis was restricted to the mitochondrial genome and is not comprehensive. Several small pockets of populations survive across the eastern coast and eastern states of India, and many are perhaps yet to be discovered (Adhya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Murthy Kantimahanti and Giridhar Malla <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). Similarly, in the western semi-arid part of India a recent record in Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (Sadhu and Reddy 2013) and protected wetlands in the areas neighbouring Rajasthan such as Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary near Agra (Baiju Raj <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) suggest that populations either exist in pockets or are long-distance dispersers tracking suitable habitats. Extensive surveys are required to clarify this. Fishing Cat was thought to be extinct in Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Rajasthan, by 2007 (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but a later survey recorded an individual, and though numbers may be drastically reduced, some individuals may still persist there (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Abrar Khan pers. comm. 2011). North-eastern India is another region where the species is recorded from pockets e.g. Manas (Qamar Qureshi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) and Kaziranga Tiger Reserves (Qamar Qureshi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) in Assam and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2003, Aparajita Dutta <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2012). Though there have been several camera-trap surveys in this region targeting Tiger, these may not have adequately covered the habitat of Fishing Cat. Focussed surveys along the several river courses in the region are required to gauge population connectivity and status of Fishing Cat.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and destruction along with the killing of Fishing Cats by local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more, in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside the strongholds, declines may have been considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue currently, and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal and 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta are likely in the next 15 years. These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a drop of a further 30% in the global population.",Decreasing,"The natural distribution of the Fishing Cat is unclear throughout its global range, with many unauthenticated, ambiguous and erroneous records clouding understanding (Pocock 1939, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016, Duckworth 2016, Willcox 2016). In addition the species is not well recorded by typical modern general faunal surveys, meaning that absence of records from areas without specific Fishing Cat surveys should not be taken to imply absence of the species (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010, Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016). Other factors also hinder determination of current range: putative introductions, sporadic records from regions not included in past distribution assessments, persistence in small pockets but with drastically reduced numbers and potentially amid areas of widespread extirpation, and possible recent extinctions through much of its range (Adhya <em>et al.</em> 2011, Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014, Adhya 2016, Duckworth 2016, Kantimahanti 2016, Mukherjee 2016, Willcox 2016). &#160;<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia from Pakistan in the west to Cambodia in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to Sri Lanka and peninsular Thailand in the south. Its distribution was probably always patchy because of its strong association with wetlands. Current known occurrence is extremely localized across the range except for West Bengal in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.&#160; Results of a molecular analysis of Fishing Cat faeces from five protected areas in India indicated that in the past Fishing Cat populations were connected from the Terai in northern India to the Coringa mangroves on India's east coast; it is unknown whether contemporary populations are still connected physically (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mukherjee 2016). Also unknown is whether population units in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion at the base of the Himalayas are connected outside protected areas or along river courses.<br/><br/>More recently, the species has been recorded in areas where it was never observed before, such as in southern Andhra Pradesh, India, and in the far south of coastal Thailand. It had presumably been overlooked in these areas previously; they are unlikely to indicate recent range extension. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia its occurrence is likely to be extremely patchy in Viet Nam, Lao PDR (if it occurs there at all), Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Java, Indonesia.<br/><br/>Detailed country-wise distributions are provided below:<br/><br/>Pakistan: this population was thought to be close to extinction in the early 1970s (Roberts 1977), but Islam <em>et al.</em> (2015) camera-trapped individuals in the Chotiari Reservoir area in the Sanghar District of Sindh Province. There are also reports of individuals being sold and seized in a wildlife market in Karachi (Bhatti 2015, Faraz Ubairi <em>in litt.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Nepal: intensive camera trapping surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> monitoring since 2008 corroborated the Fishing Cat's presence in Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the far western Terai, but failed to record it in Bardia National Park (Babu Ram Lamichhane and Shailendra Yadav pers. comm. 2016). It is present in and around Jagadishpur Reservoir, a Ramsar site in south-western Nepal (Dahal <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in Chitwan National Park in the central Terai (Dahal and Dahal 2011, Mishra 2016). In south-eastern Nepal, it has been recorded in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (Pandey <em>et al.</em> 2012, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sagar Dahal and Angie Appel <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Whether these populations are connected outside protected areas remains unknown.<br/><br/>India: protected areas hosting Fishing Cat populations include Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Baiju Raj <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Corbett Tiger Reserve, Uttarakhand (Abishek Harihar <em>in litt.</em> 2012), Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in West Bengal (Yadavendradev Jhala <em>in litt.</em> 2015), Keoladeo Ghana National Park (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012) and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan (Sadhu and Reddy 2013), Kaziranga Karbi Anglong Landscape (Jimmy Borah <em>in litt.</em> 2012) and Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam (Qamar Qureshi <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar (Qamar Qureshi <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Malla and Sivakumar 2014) and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Aparajita Datta <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Outside protected areas, records exist from Pilibhit Forest Division in Uttar Pradesh (Meraj Anwar <em>in litt.</em> 2011), in small wetland patches in West Bengal near Kolkata and its suburbs like the Howrah and Hooghly districts (Anonymous 1989, Adhya <em>et al.</em> 2011), in Medinipur and Nadia districts and in the human-dominated north-eastern part of Chilika Lake and Tangi district in Odisha (Tiasa Adhya <em>in litt.</em> 2016). The Fishing Cat has also been recorded recently in areas lacking historical records viz. the Krishna River mangroves in Andhra Pradesh (Kantimahanti 2016). There are also historical statements of occurrence in the Western Ghats and the western coast of India (Pocock 1939), which have not been confirmed by recent targeted searches and may have been in error (Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In the Duars of north-eastern India, superficially suitable habitat may extend into Bhutan, but a number of general surveys there have not recorded the species (e.g. Tempa <em>et al.</em> 2013, Banerjee and Bandopadhyay 2016).<br/><br/>Sri Lanka: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas along the coast and in the island's interior (Andrew Kittle <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Individuals have also been recorded in densely human-populated urban areas of Colombo and outside protected areas in Kandy, Mathle and Nuwaraeliya districts (Ratnayaka 2016, Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>Bangladesh: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas of the Sundarbans (Rahman 2016, Adam Barlow pers. comm. 2016), in unprotected wetlands in the Brahmaputra river basin (Rahman and McCarthy 2014, Chowdhury <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in the Chittagong hill tracts (Chakma 2015, Karim and Ahsan 2016). However, Chakma (2015) obtained only three potential records of which two were pugmarks and one was a video from a camera-trap which was not authenticated as Fishing Cat and could have been a Leopard Cat P. bengalensis.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, there are only two certain field records: one from the early 20th century in the Hukaung Valley in the north, and one from Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary in the Ayeyarwady (= Irrawaddy) delta in or around 2015 (Than Zaw <em>in litt.</em> 2016). This corroborates reports that a few captive individuals in the country are said to be descendants of animals captured in or around the 1990s in the Ayeyarwady delta (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Thailand: during targeted surveys Fishing Cat was recorded inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park and Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area along the coast, but not in protected areas farther inland that were previously thought to harbour Fishing Cat (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh <em>et al.</em> 2014). An incidental record came from the coast in southern Thailand (Buatip <em>et al.</em> 2013; confirmed by photograph examined by J.W. Duckworth and W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2016), which constitutes the southernmost valid record with a precise locality to date in mainland Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Cambodia: camera-trap records are scarce and limited to Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in the country's north-east (Rainey and Kong 2010), and mangrove habitats in Peam Krasaop Wildlife Sanctuary and Ream National Park on the coast (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Despite extensive camera-trapping in eastern and northern Cambodia including Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in recent years, Fishing Cat was not recorded. (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2012, Simon Mahood pers. comm. 2016). A kitten found orphaned in Botum-Sakor National Park was identified as Fishing Cat, but may have been a Leopard Cat (Royan 2009). Of many other claims in the last 15 years, most are certainly in error, but a critical evaluation of all has not been performed.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR most claims are either in certain error or non-assessable; only one sounds credible but this is a sight-record that cannot be validated (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Viet Nam: Fishing Cat may persist in the Mekong Delta, where it was last camera-trapped in 2000 (Willcox 2016). There is a very small possibility that it occurs in the Red River Delta (where it has never been confirmed), though there have been no targeted surveys to be confident of genuine absence or local extinction (Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Indonesia: it is known to have occurred only along the west and north coast of Java within 15 km of the coast (Sody 1936, Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996), but there are no records of wild-living individuals since 2000. The inferences of Melisch <em>et al.</em> (1996) are based on a single track and some scats, neither of which can be treated as conclusive evidence. Alain Compost photographed Fishing Cats in Java in the 1990s and suggested that some may still survive in the Banten Bay region and in Ujung Kulon National Park (Alain Compost <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Until 2000, he photographed Fishing Cats in Pulau Dua Bird Sanctuary, a protected mangrove forest on the northern coast, but learned of all Fishing Cats been poisoned there by 2006 (Alain Compost <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros sondaicus</em> in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson <em>in litt.</em> 2016); the overlap, if any, of camera-trap stations with microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat is not known.<br/><br/>There is no certain record from Sumatra, but historical testimony from a hunter who was familiar with the species from Java, and a captive individual in the 2000s in a local zoo indicate that the species might inhabit the island (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, contra Sanderson 2009).<br/><br/>Occurrence in Peninsular Malaysia is also open to doubt (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009), but the Thai locality record in Buatip <em>et al.</em> (2013) is very close to the Malaysian border. Past claims for Borneo, Taiwan and China lack any credible basis (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Jutzeler <em>et al.</em> 2010). <br/><br/>The species is known from sea level in parts of its range, and in the northern parts it is likely to occur only in the lowlands. Recent reliable elevation records in the Terai of India and Nepal are all from below 150 m, such as Pilibhit Forest Division and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (Meraj Anwar <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Jagadishpur Reservoir area, Chitwan National Park (Dahal <em>et al.</em> 2015, Dahal and Dahal 2012) and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve area (Angie Appel <em>in litt.</em> 2016), except one at 330 m on the southern edge of Corbett Tiger Reserve (Abishek Harihar <em>in litt.</em> 2012). However, Pocock (1939) accepted a Fishing Cat skin from Barkot near Dehra Dun on the banks of the upper Yamuna river as evidence of at least occasional high-altitude occurrence at about 5,000 ft (ca. 1,500 m), but did not explain whether this individual was killed there, or whether there was any possibility that, while a skin had been procured at that altitude, the animal had originated elsewhere. In Sri Lanka, Fishing Cat has been recorded at elevations up to 1,800 m (Ashan Thudugala <em>in litt.</em> 2016). However, the Sri Lankan altitudinal range seems to be an exception as all other authentic locality records are much lower than that.","The Fishing Cat is killed for consumption and a very recent report from Howrah district, India, reveals the rampant killing of the species outside protected areas in human-dominated landscapes for consumption as part of a cultural practice. Such cases most often go unnoticed or are ignored unless some interested people and non-governmental organisations pursue the case until the perpetrators are convicted (Adhya 2015). In Cambodia, the Fishing Cat is killed by local people for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). In Thailand a radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015) demonstrated that poaching is a major threat when five of 16 radio-collared individuals were killed by poachers (for consumption and retaliation) within the three-year study period. Cutter (2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared individuals attributed to poaching and unknown causes. Opportunistic trading of skins and potentially other parts is likely to occur in mainland Southeast Asia, where such trading is at very high levels and involves a wide diversity of species (e.g. Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014), but there is no evidence of its being particularly sought after there. Similarly, in Java individuals are sometimes seen in the island’s intensive live animal (‘pet’) trade (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009), but again there is no indication that it is (yet) a specific target.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Fishing Cat is included in CITES Appendix II and protected by national legislation over most of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam Fishing Cat has the highest level of protection under the main species protection law (decree 32/2006/ND-CP) and is included in appendix I B. This completely prohibits any exploitation or commercial trade. There is no protection afforded outside protected areas in Nepal (Karan B. Shah, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Since 1985, the Fishing Cat has been confirmed to occur in protected areas (but it should not be assumed necessarily to survive in all) including the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and India; Suklaphanta, Chitwan and Koshi Tappu in Nepal; Corbett, Dudwha, Keoladeo Ghana, Coringa and Kaziranga in India; Yala, Wilpattu, Maduru Oya, Horton Plains, Dunumadallawa, Kalametiya, Sinharaja, Bundala and Uda Walawe in Sri Lanka; Khao Sam Roi Yot and Thale Noi in Thailand; Kulen Promtep, Peam Krasaop and Ream in Cambodia. Several wetlands that hold Fishing Cat populations are listed under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of important wetlands, e.g. Sundarbans in Bangladesh, Chilika Lake, Keoladeo Ghana and East Kolkata Wetlands in India, Jagadishpur Reservoir in Nepal and Chotiari Reservoir in Pakistan.<br/><br/>The survival of the species depends on adequate protection of remaining wetlands in Asia, and prevention of indiscriminate trapping, snaring and poisoning.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

58303674,39375,Carcharhinus melanopterus,Vulnerable,A2bcd,2020,2020-07-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Blacktip Reef Shark (<em>Carcharhinus melanopterus</em>) is a medium-sized (to at least 180 cm TL) coastal shark that occurs in coral reef and associated habitats in tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans from the surface down to a depth of at least 75 m. The species has relatively low biological productivity. It is caught as target and bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries through much of its range in gears including longline, gillnet, handline and trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth, and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in the habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 254 reefs in 40 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 51.2% over three generation lengths (44 years), but this is likely an over-estimate because of complex spatial and ecological factors that affect the abundance of this species. Therefore, the Blacktip Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation  and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Blacktip Reef Shark is a coastal species that is common in shallow water on and near coral reefs, where it occurs from the surface to depths of at least 75 m. It is often associated with coral reefs, but in many locations the young  use mangrove systems early in life if they are available (Chin <em>et al.</em> 2013a). It reaches a maximum size of 180 cm total length (TL) and maturity is reached between 90 and 134 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Stevens 1984, Last and Stevens 2009, Chin <em>et al.</em> 2013b).&#160;Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and small litters of 2–4 pups (Compagno 1984, Lyle 1987, Last and Stevens 2009), a biennial reproductive cycle (Stevens 1984) and a size-at-birth of 30–50 cm TL (Mourier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). On the Great Barrier Reef males mature at 4.2 years and females at 8.5 years. Longevity of field sampled individuals was estimated as 15 years, but this is known to be an underestimation due to limitations in age estimation methods, and captive animals have lived for over 25 years (Chin<em> et al</em>. 2013b); using these age data the generation length is estimated to be between 12–17 years (average of 14.5 years).","The Blacktip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small scale longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in continental shelf waters and those around oceanic islands and reefs, especially those around coral reefs. Most are taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. For example, in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef it makes up 1.1% of shark catch in inshore gillnets (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011) and 5% of sharks caught in the line fishery for reef teleosts (Heupel <em>et al. </em>2009). In Indonesia it makes up 0.3% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter <em>et al</em>. In press).&#160;While in Fiji, Blacktip Reef Shark makes up more than half of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. There is limited species-specific catch trend data available for most countries, however, throughout much of the species' range there are intensive coastal fisheries that are likely to exert significant pressure on the stocks. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and the effort continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al</em>. 2012), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.<br/><br/>This species is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.","Genetic studies support the presence of multiple subpopulations throughout its range, with structure detected between and within island groups in the Pacific (Vingnaud <em>et al</em>. 2014). How many subpopulations exist is currently unknown because of limited sampling of most locations.<br/><br/>The Blacktip Reef Shark in common in tropical and subtropical waters but there is little data available on population status and trends. Severe localized depletions in reef sharks, that include the Blacktip Reef Shark, have been recorded from the Indian Ocean (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Based on diving survey data, Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) showed that the number of reef sharks in the Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean) declined from a mean of 4.2 sharks per dive in 1970 to 0.4 in 2006, which represents a population reduction of 94% over three generations (44 years). Species-specific data were available for the period between 1996 and 2006 and showed a decline in the Blacktip Reef Shark to a level where it was rarely encountered in 2006 (Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Towed-diver surveys performed in the&#160;Western Central Pacific&#160;between 2004 and 2010&#160;showed that reef shark densities are higher at remote locations with very limited or no human presence&#160;(Nadon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Based on a modelling approach, they estimated that reef sharks (including the Blacktip Reef Shark) in this region&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">have declined to 3–10% of baseline levels, with baseline considered absence of humans (Nadon&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2012)<span class=""apple-converted-space"">.

This is the largest and most recent data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimate depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef level depletion estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to total global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Blacktip Reef Sharks was estimated as 51.2% (standard error 43.3–59.6%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (44 years) (see Supplementary Information). The error estimates include both the IUCN Red List Vulnerable and Endangered categories. However, the ability of the Global Finprint data to estimate depletion for this species is limited by complex ecological patterns not accounted for in the methodology. As a result it over-estimates the level of decline at some reefs where population levels are thought to be healthy.

It is found in rivers in China. It is found at depths ranging from one to at least 20 m. This is a euryhaline species which lives in the bottom layer of inshore and inland waters. Spawning occurs in estuaries, and this species is known to migrate into freshwater to spawn. It is a commercial species which is considered highly-valued, however there is little information available to characterize the fishery. This species has been bred in captivity, and it is unclear whether or not this effort has been for the purposes of stock enhancement. There is little species-specific population information available. This species' dependence on freshwater systems to spawn and its predictable, seasonal mass spawning migrations into freshwater systems render it particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Seasonal fishing prohibitions and the presence of both fresh and marine water preserves in parts of its range may offer this species some protection<em>. Takifugu obscurus</em> is assessed as Least Concern.","<p><em>Takifugu obscurus</em> is a demersal, &#160;anadromous species which undergoes annual seasonal migrations into freshwater systems to spawn. In the Yangtze River basin, the spawning period for <em>T. obscurus</em> is from March until April. This species maintains a sex ratio of approximately 1: 1. This species reaches sexual maturity between 25 and 28 cm (SL). The ovaries and blood are extremely toxic, while the liver, skin, and intestine are highly toxic. The flesh and testes are innocuous (Nakabo 2002).<br/> <br/> This species lives in the bottom layer of inshore and inland waters, and grows 20–40 cm in length. Most of the growth takes place in the sea but they spawn in brackish and fresh water. During the spawning season, which is from late spring to early summer, the sexually mature fish run into river estuaries and spawn in inland waters including rivers, lakes, and ponds. The fingerlings grow in the inland water and either return to the sea the next spring or they there for a few months before returning to the sea. In the sea they grow to sexually mature fish over several years, and then return to the inland water again to spawn (Kato <em>et al.</em> 2005).</p>","There have been no confirmed population declines in&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. obscurus</span>. However, it is likely to be impacted by the following:<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fugu fishery</span><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. obscurus</span>&#160;are unknown, it is likely that populations of this minor commercial species are impacted by this fishery.&#160;<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</span><br/>Fishes of the genus&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span>&#160;have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia.

As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Fishes of the genus&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span>&#160;are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span>&#160;species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).",There is little species-specific population information available for wild populations of&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>.,Stable,"In the Western Pacific<em>, Takifugu obscurus</em> is known from the Yellow Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea south to the Korean Peninsula.

The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002.

Although highly valuable (the market price of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes</span>&#160;is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<br/><br/>Tiger puffer (<em>T. rubripes</em>) was introduced to China from Japan (Lin and Huang 2007). To meet increasing demand for pufferfish, China began large-scale artificial breeding of pufferfish in the 1990s. An annual output of about 4,000 tonnes of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, which was introduced from Japan to China (Lin and Huang 2007) is exported to Japan and South Korea. Additionally, an annual output of about 6,000 tonnes of&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>&#160;was also produced for export in China. Pufferfishes are still landed in China, mostly in Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other places. Nationwide, the total output of pufferfish is now around 20,000 t per year (Ma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011)</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>,&#160;however, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining&#160;<em>T. rubripes&#160;</em>fisheries have benefited&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>. Additionally,<em>&#160;T. obscurus&#160;</em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p><p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><em>Takifugu obscurus</em>&#160;can be found in both freshwater and marine protected areas. According to the protection regulations for wetlands in the Poyang Lake of Jiangxi Province (2004) and the implementation of Chinese Fishery Lawin Jiangxi Province (1987), fishing is is banned from March 20th to June 20th every year in Poyang Lake. This corresponds with the spawning migration of this species in China, although whether or not this species spawns in the lake is unknown. Fishing has also been banned for two months from June 1st to July 31st each year since 1987 along the Xiajiang reach, Xingan reach, Jishui reach and Jian reach of the Ganjiang River, where this species has been recorded.

It is demersal in freshwater, mangrove-fringed rivers, estuaries, and shallow inshore waters at depths &lt;40 m. It appears to be an ecological specialist with a very patchy occurrence and probably limited habitat.<br/><br/>This species is a very minor bycatch of prawn trawl fisheries on the Queensland east coast but is not at risk from trawl fisheries across northern Australia as they do not trawl in its shallow inshore habitats. It is both discarded from some commercial fisheries and killed when captured in others. The species is bycatch of recreational fisheries and mostly is destroyed when captured and is persecuted by oyster fishers. <br/><br/>It was reportedly once common in parts of New South Wales, but is now uncommon along the New South Wales coast. There is anecdotal evidence of a historic and more recent decline in abundance and area of occupancy due to nearshore development across ~25% of its range, i.e. across the southern portion of its range. Across the remainder of its range, it is either unfished or lightly fished, and habitat degradation is less of a threat. Taking a precautionary approach which considers the historic and more recent declines in abundance and area of occupancy in part of its range, and that is appears to be an ecological specialist with a very patchy occurrence, it is suspected that the Estuary Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (52 years) due to a decline levels of exploitation and habitat degradation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2cd).","The Estuary Stingray is demersal in shallow inshore waters, mangrove-fringed rivers, and estuaries at depths &lt;40 m (Pogonsoki <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b, Grant <em>et al</em>. 2019). It is also known to ascend rivers to beyond the tidal limit (Whitley 1940). It appears to be an ecological specialist with a very patchy occurrence and probably limited habitat. It reaches a maximum size of 93 cm disc width (DW) and possibly up to 160 cm DW, males mature at 41 cm DW and females mature at 63 cm DW (Pierce and Bennett 2010b, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). Reproduction is viviparous with litter size unknown, an annual reproductive cycle and a size-at-birth of ~11 cm DW (Pierce and Bennett 2010b). Female age-at-maturity is 13.4 years and maximum age is 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 17.2 years (Pierce and Bennett 2010b).","The species is taken as a minor part of the bycatch in inshore commercial fisheries, including demersal prawn trawl fisheries in New South Wales and Queensland, and by commercial tunnel net in Queensland (Courtney <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jacobsen et al. 2018, P. Kyne unpubl. data 2015). The species has not been recorded in the elasmobranch bycatch of the Northern Prawn Fishery and the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery that operate across northern Australia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2000), likely because of its close inshore shallow water habitat that is not trawled by these two fisheries. It has been reported as a very minor component of all bycatch (&lt;0.1%) in the Queensland East Coast Banana Prawn Trawl Fishery (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2000). It is not utilized commercially with regulations preventing retention in Queensland, and it is discarded. At-vessel mortality (AVM) and post-release mortality for this species is unknown, although AVM it is suspected to be moderate; Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. (2002) found an at-vessel mortality of 53–59% for two species of stingrays captured in the Northern Prawn Fishery. In some inshore commercial fisheries, there is the practice of 'spiking' incidentally caught stingrays (using a metal bar or stick with a sharpened point attached to pierce the animal's chondrocranium and remove it from nets, sorting trays, etc.) that is source of mortality.<br/><br/>The species is a bycatch of inshore recreational line fishing as it readily takes cut fish baits and is thus prone to capture. Incidental capture by recreational fishers is likely a significant threat to the species as fishers often destroy any stingray catches (Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002, P. Kyne unpubl. data 2015). The Estuary Stingray has been reported to feed voraciously on farmed oysters (Whitley 1940, Last and Stevens 2009), and is persecuted by commercial shellfish farmers in New South Wales and southern Queensland estuaries.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation and loss are also a threat to this species due to its occurrence in shallow inshore, riverine, and estuarine habitats. There has been significant habitat loss and alteration along parts of the Australian east coast as a result of the reclamation of large areas of shallow muddy tidal bays and mangroves for the development of urban areas, canal estates, marinas, and large-scale developments such as the Port of Brisbane and Brisbane Airport expansions. For example, over 20% of the original mangrove habitat of Moreton Bay in southern Queensland has been lost to such development since European settlement (Greenwood 1993).","This species was once considered common, but there is anecdotal evidence of a decline in abundance and area of occupancy for this species in parts of New South Wales and southern Queensland (Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2003). Historic accounts report that the Estuary Stingray was an extremely common species in the bays and estuaries of New South Wales and southern Queensland. It has not been reported from Port Jackson and Botany Bay, New South Wales, where it was once common, since the 1880s. In more recent years, i.e., since 2000, it has been reported on the central New South Wales coast (Pierce and Bennett 2010a). Records and occurrence appear to be very patchy, with most records from rivers, estuaries, bays and harbours (Pierce and Bennett 2010a). The species is still locally common in some southern Queensland estuaries and bays (i.e., Hervey Bay, parts of Moreton Bay) (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011). It also has been reported to persist in highly modified habitats for long periods of time (&gt;100 years) (Pierce and Bennett 2010a). It is a very minor component of commercial prawn trawl fisheries in Queensland where an ecological risk assessment of the southern Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery assessed this species as at intermediate risk based on its level of resilience to fisheries and the fishing pressure on the species (Jacobsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is not at risk from prawn trawl fisheries across northern Australia as it is not encountered by those fisheries, likely as they do not trawl in shallow inshore habitats. However, there is no information on population trends across the northern part of its range.<br/><br/>Overall, historic and more recent anecdotal declines in abundance and area of occupancy have occurred in ~25% of its range (the southern part of its range) due to the combined threats of bycatch in commercial fisheries, destruction of incidental catches by recreational fishers and during some commercial fishing activities, persecution by shellfish farmers, and habitat degradation and loss due to nearshore coastal development. Across the rest of its range, bycatch mitigation measures have been in place since 2000, it is either unfished or lightly fished, and habitat degradation is less of a threat. Taking a precautionary approach and considering the historic and more recent declines in abundance and area of occupancy in the southern part of its range and that is appears to be an ecological specialist with a very patchy occurrence, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (52 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in area of occupancy due to habitat degradation.",Decreasing,"The Estuary Stingray is endemic to northern and eastern Australia in the Western Central and Southwest Pacific where it ranges from Darwin, Northern Territory to Wagonga Inlet, southern New South Wales (Pierce and Bennet 2010a, Gladstone <em>et al</em>. 2012, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). It was previously considered to also occur across southern Papua New Guinea and Indonesian West Papua, however these records represent another species, the Merauke Stingay (<em>Hemitrygon longicauda</em>) (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b).<br/><em></em><em></em>",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"There are no specific conservation actions for the Estuary Stingray. Elasmobranchs cannot be retained in the Queensland prawn trawl fishery or the Northern Prawn Fishery and so incidental captures are discarded. The use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) is mandated in all Australian prawn trawl fisheries and has been shown to be an effective way to reduce the catches of large rays in prawn trawls (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2020); large individual Estuary Stingrays may be excluded from capture. There is a possession limit of one shark or ray for recreational fishers in Queensland. The species likely occurs in a number of marine protected areas in New South Wales and Queensland waters, although zoning plans for these parks and reserves restrict fishing activities in only small areas and do not generally protect sufficient areas of the habitat of this species. The zoning plan for the Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland includes closed areas representing 16% of the area of the Park.

Although this seagrass decline in Europe was estimated to be 29% measured over 127 years from 1879 until 2006, the decline should be measured over the last 10 years to be considered as relevant for the Red List assessment. The species also resides in algal habitats.&#160;It is expected that further declines in the remaining seagrass habitats in Europe could result in the species becoming threatened and ongoing monitoring of populations and habitat trends is recommended.","<em>Nerophis ophidion</em> inhabits marine neritic areas with seagrasses to depths of about 15 metres. It preys on crustacean zooplankton from seagrass canopy leaves, including ostracods, amphipods, gastropods and decapods, as well as benthic cnidairians and copepods (Franzoi <em>et al. </em>2004, Gurkan <em>et al. </em>2011).

One study also found that <em>N. ophidion</em> is associated specifically with the seagrass <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em> (Malavasi <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>The species exhibits strong sexual dimorphism with the females being substantially larger than males (Malavasi <em>et al.</em> 2007). Males have been shown to limit the reproductive rate of females and, as a result, the behavioural sex roles are reversed in that females compete for male mates (Berglund and Rosenqvist 1993). Unlike many of the pipefishes, males brood their young externally without the presence of a brood pouch (McCoy <em>et al. </em>2001) and instead have the eggs attached via mucous (Carcupino <em>et al. </em>2002). An extended courtship ritual occurs prior to egg transfer (Vincent <em>et al.</em> 1995) and males have been documented carrying eggs from April to October (Riccato <em>et al. </em>2003).","The threats to <em>Nerophis ophidion </em>include habitat loss and degradation. Seagrasses have declined substantially across Europe (Airoldi and Beck 2007) and increases in filamentous algae that often accompany coastal degradation from development and pollution are detrimental to the species (Sundin <em>et al. </em>2011).

Therefore, it is evaluated as Least Concern.&#160;However, fisheries landings have decreased notably over time, as the fishing fleet has increased in boats, fishermen and equipment, and is expected to continue decreasing in the near future. Additionally, there are many environmental stressors (e.g. deforestation and sedimentation) with negative effects on river integrity and fish populations within its distribution. Monitoring is therefore recommended.<br/><p></p>","<em>Prochilodus mariae</em> is freshwater, benthopelagic and potamodromous fish, and occupies (in different moments) all freshwater habitats in the mountains, foothills and plains. This species generally can&#160;be found in the flooded forests and lakes  associated with the rivers of the Orinoco basin and within the main  rivers during migration (Barbarino-Duque <em>et al</em>. 1998). In the ribazon<em>, </em>it occurs with several species, such as <em>Brycon, Piaractus, Mylossoma, Leporinus,&#160;Oxydoras,&#160;Brachyplatystoma, Hemisorubin, </em>and<em> Pseudoplatystoma</em>.<br/><br/>The species has two migrations per year; the first for reproduction when the rains increase water levels in April and May, and a second when the water descends in November and December and the fish move from the lagoons to the main rivers and canals to avoid the warming waters (Galvis <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zapata-Padilla and Usma-Oviedo 2013). In the rainy season the species reproduce and spends in the savannas flooded with lentic bodies (lagoons, ""préstamos"", ""esteros"" and ""bajíos""). As the dry season begins, the vast majority of the population moves upstream (called ribazón in Venezuela and subienda in Colombia) to the Andean foothills and (in minor quantities) to the mountains in the Guiana Shield, where it remains until the rains return. It travels high into the mountains and surprisingly reaches small streams with hardly any water (Taphorn 1992). In these small rivers it remains until the rainy season increases the flow considerably, at which time it descends to the plains (usually in the midst of floods) and in the course of this it reproduces. It demonstrates long distance, longitudinal and local migration estimated at between 100 and 500 km distance in several tributaries of Orinoco, principally in Andean versants.&#160; In the migrations events, Barbarino <em>et al.</em> (1998) estimated an density of 863,200 ind/ha in Apure river (lowlands) and 198,000 ind/ha for the Guanare river (upper llanos).<br/><br/>The species is a iliophagous and detritivorous fish. The diet includes protozoa and bacteria from sludge and detritus, epibenthic algae and plankton (Taphorn 1992). Immature individuals consume more algae and less mud (fine amorphous detritus) than adults; the latter eat diatoms and filamentous algae (Barbarino <em>et al. </em>1998). <br/><br/>In the Meta river the maximum length of the species is 45 cm standard length (Ramírez-Gil <em>et al</em>. 2015), but it can reach around 500 mm SL and 3 kg. However the average is much lower, probably associated with fishing pressure. The species has larger sizes in flood areas and lagoons than in rivers. The females at age at 23 cm SL in Apure river (Barbarino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998),&#160;and they reach a fertility of 824,265 eggs in the lower Orinoco (Nova and Ramos 1982).&#160;In upper plains of Apure (caño Maraca) the species has a generation length of 24 months and fecundity of 28,950 eggs/female with mean length of 260 mm standard length (Winemiller and Taphorn 1989). It is estimated that the reproduction is massive and occurs in the channel of rivers and during flood events. The fertilized eggs are carried away by the current and are deposited in flooding plains where then the larvae hatch.","<p>Drainage basin degradation and land use change in the Orinoco basin&#160;are a result of massive deforestation (Oliveira-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2010), causing significant erosion in the upper basins and the fragmentation and loss of streams and rivers due to sedimentation (Dudgeon 2008). The loss of these piedmont rivers has an important effect on the life cycle of <em>P. mariae </em>(Lilyestrom and Taphorn 1978, Winemiller <em>et al</em>. 1996). Another threat in this area is tree clearance in riparian zones, often illegal, which changes light regimes and can increase mortality rates of fish larvae due to increased ultraviolet radiation. Nutrients formerly from wood and debris is also removed from the ecosystem. The loss of this wood debris may also impact rates of predation as schools of fish in open water seek out debris for shelter (Wright and Flecker 2004). In&#160;Venezuela, the several dams in Andean and coastal ranges impede upstream migration of <em>Prochilodus mariae</em>, alongside many species of pimelodid catfishes. However, the main current and future threat to the species is the commercial fishery, which occurs with greater intensity in the Apure river basin and in the lower and middle Orinoco. The reduction of <em>Prochilodus mariae</em> by fisheries could disrupt carbon flow in river and probably alter the ecosystem metabolism (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2006), including the loss of its role as habitat modifiers and maintainers for other species.&#160;</p>","<p>This species is very abundant and temporarily can dominate in number and biomass in foothill rivers (e.g. Las Marías river in Apure drainage; Flecker 1996). Following data collection between 2004 and 2009, the species has exhibited overall declines in landing numbers and over-exploitation is cited as the key driver of these declines. However, it should also be considered that subpopulations vary extensively year to year as a result of environmental factors, such as high rain years. Simultaneously the average size of this species has also decreased over time suggesting unsustainable fishing methodologies (Lasso <em>et al.</em> 2011). Even though the fishing records are variable, the evidence and general trends indicate that the population of the species is declining and this has been true for decades (e.g. Barbarino-Duque <em>et al.</em> 1998, Novoa 2002).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""ES"">The type locality for <em>Prochilodus</em><span lang=""ES""><em> mariae</em>&#160;is Barrigón, Río Meta in Colombia (Eigenmann 1922).

This species breeds in single pairs or loose groups and remains in dispersed pairs or small groups whilst undergoing the post-breeding moult (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982). During the non-breeding season congregations of 20-30, several hundreds or even thousands may occur in feeding areas (del Hoyo <I>et al. </I>1992, Hockey <I>et al.</I> 2005). The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982), foraging mainly during the first two hours after dawn and last two hours before sunset (Hockey <I>et al.</I> 2005). <B>Habitat </B>This species inhabits shallow freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall grass (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982). Such habitats include freshwater lakes, seasonal freshwater pools, slow-flowing streams, marshy areas, swamps in open flat terrain and flooded grasslands (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982, Kear 2005a). It also very frequently occurs in areas of wet rice cultivation (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982, Kear 2005a), and seeks the cover of densely vegetated wetlands while it is vulnerable and flightless during its moulting period (Kear 2005a). <B>Diet </B>The species is predominantly vegetarian, feeding on aquatic seeds and fruits, bulbs, leaf shoots, buds and the structural parts of aquatic plants such as grasses and rushes, although it does occasionally take small aquatic insects (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982, Hockey <I>et al.</I> 2005). It is also shows a preference for cultivated rice grains (Hohman <I>et al.</I> 1996). <B>Breeding site </B>The nests of this species are predominantly mounds of plant material, often floating on water and well concealed amidst vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982). In India however, the species is primarily tree-nesting, utilising hollow trees and even disused stick nests of large birds such as kites or crows (Madge and Burn 1988). <B>","This species is persecuted through hunting in many rice growing areas (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and there has been a marked decline in numbers due to shooting anf trapping at Lake Alaotra in Madagascar (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also often exposed to pesticides used on rice crops, is suceptible to lead poisoning, and suffers mortality through collision with powerlines (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The damming of the Senegal river has markedly decreased the habitat quality in that area, which may be having a negative impact on the population in that area (Triplett and Yesou 2000). Wetland habitat degradation on the east coast of India due to siltation, proliferation of invasive freshwater plant species (such as water hyacinth <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>), increased aquaculture activities and eutrophication may threaten the small proportion of the species that utilises the area (Nayak 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian botulism, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (van Heerden 1974). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted for local consumption and trade from Lake Chilwa, Malawi (Bhima 2006).

They then move short distances to coastal areas in search of suitable habitat for the dry season (Kear 2005b, Young 2006)<strong></strong>. During the breeding season the species occurs in solitary, dispersed pairs<strong></strong>, but during the non-breeding season it is more gregarious and occurs in loose groups of up to 40 individuals (Green <em>et al. </em>1994, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. Pair-bonds may last through consecutive seasons and investment by males is high and involves the protection of the female and young (Young 2006)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds only in seasonally flooded, non-tidal areas dominated by Black Mangrove <em>Avicennia marina</em>, on the landward side of littoral forest (Razafindrajao 2000, Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006, Young 2006, H.

Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007, Safford and Hawkins 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>During its post-breeding moult, during which time it is flightless (Young 2006)<strong></strong>, the species seeks out lakes that are rich in aquatic vegetation<strong></strong>, and in the subsequent dry season it is found in coastal wetland areas of shallow water and nutrient-rich mud<strong></strong>, including saline and brackish areas (Razafindrajao 2000, Kear 2005b, Safford and Hawkins 2013)<strong></strong>. Here it prefers open rather than vegetated wetlands (Young 2006)<strong></strong> and is most often found in coastal mangrove forest, bays, estuaries and shallow saline wetlands just inland of mangroves (tannes), though it can also be found less frequently in marshes, dense deciduous forest, areas of open water and herbaceous savannah, especially where <em>Hyparrhenia</em> and <em>Heteropogon</em> grasses are present (Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. <strong>Diet </strong>Little is known about its diet except during moulting when it feeds on terrestrial and aquatic insects including Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera, in addition to the seeds of various plant families and the leaves and stems of monocotyledons (Kear 2005b)<strong></strong>. It usually feeds by dabbling in the mud while wading (Young 1995, Morris and Hawkins 1998)<strong></strong>. <strong>Breeding Site </strong>Nesting takes place in holes in <em>Avicennia marina</em> mangrove trees that have been created by storm damage or decay (Kear 2005b, Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong><em></em><strong></strong>.  Ducklings fledge at 45-49 days (Young 2006)<strong></strong>.   <p></p>","The species is now extremely threatened throughout its breeding range, by extensive habitat loss and disturbance. The distribution of known sites suggests that the single subpopulation is being fragmented as areas of habitat become unsuitable (Young 2006, H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. The species has limited dispersal capabilities and isolation may result in the loss of genetic diversity (Young 2006)<strong></strong>. Furthermore it is threatened by virtue of being highly specific to a series of habitats - which are themselves threatened - throughout its annual cycle (Razafindrajao 2000)<strong></strong>.  Conversion of shallow, muddy water-bodies to rice cultivation (Young <em>et al</em>. 1993)<strong></strong> has been so widespread on the west coast that in the non-breeding season the species now appears to be confined to the few suitable wetlands that are too saline for rice-growing, i.e. some inland lakes and coastal areas such as estuaries and mudflats (Green <em>et al</em>. 1994, Safford and Hawkins 2013)<strong></strong>. In 2004, during a dry-season survey in Menabe, this species was only found in saline wetlands (Young<em> et al.</em> 2014)<strong></strong>. Pressures on coastal wetlands are exacerbated by the movement of people from the High Plateau to coastal regions, which is driven by the over-exhaustion of land (Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Mangroves are under increasing pressure from prawn-pond construction and timber extraction, which also leads to massively increased hunting (Morris and Hawkins 1998)<strong></strong>. Subsistence hunting during the nesting season and the trapping of moulting birds are major threats (Young 2006)<strong></strong>. It is considered a delicacy by hunters and was found in markets in Sofia in 2011 (H. G. Young <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). In contrast, the breeding site at Ankazomborona is not threatened by aquaculture and there is little pressure from subsistence hunters, though there is some pressure from sport hunters (Razafindrajao <em>et al.</em> 2001)<strong></strong>.  Breeding birds may suffer disturbance from human activity, such as the collection of crabs (Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. The species is potentially in competition for the use of suitable nest-holes with the Comb Duck <em>Sarkidiornis melanotos</em>, parrots <em>Coracopsis</em> species and nocturnal lemurs <em>Lepilemur</em> spp. and <em>Cheirogaleus</em> spp., though lemurs are absent in mangroves (Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006, Young 2006)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The total population is estimated at 1,500-2,500 individuals (H.

In the Sundarbans of  Bangladesh all records originate from the fresh and brackish waters with no records from the saltwater zone<strong> </strong>(Gani 2005). Most breeding appears to occur inland while most records are from lowlands, although it has occurred up to 1,220 m on migration. There is an emerging pattern of non-breeding season records in peninsular Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia and breeding season records in continental South-East Asia, with passage migrants observed between these ranges. It has been observed catching freshwater shrimp, large beetles and small fish<strong> </strong>(Shepherd 2006), but feeds mainly by gleaning insects from overhanging vegetation<strong> </strong>(J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2007). The species is generally very shy and retiring but can appear extremely tame and confiding while incubating, rendering it susceptible to human predation<strong> </strong>(Neumann-Denzau 2008).  <p></p>","The main threat is the destruction and increased levels of disturbance to rivers in lowland riverine forest, driven by agricultural clearance and logging operations and increased traffic on waterways. One off incidents may also have affected some populations such as oil spills (D. Simic <em>in litt. </em>2014).&#160;Habitats have been further degraded by the removal of bankside vegetation and changes in hydrology resulting from dam construction, and siltation. Moreover, population declines in areas such as the Sundarbans may be directly or indirectly related to climate change; with the possible effects of climate change including frequent tropical cyclones, a decline in preferred nesting habitat due to lack to suitable trees (effected by salt water intrusion due to sea level rise and reduced freshwater influx), and lower density of prey species due to environmental changes such as saltwater intrusion and cyclone (Chowdhury <em>et al. in prep.</em>). The Sundarbans are further threatened with a proposed 1,320 Megawatt power station to be built 14 km away (Fowlie 2013). Hunting and collection of eggs and chicks have been recorded and although their contribution to population declines is probably minimal this requires clarification<strong> </strong>(Neumann-Denzau 2008); indeed the species is easily caught at the nest making it prey to opportunistic human hunters, with 56% of interviewed fisherman having collected the species (adult, chick or egg) (S. Chowdhury <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","The species appears to have declined dramatically and is now known from comparatively few sites, occurring at low densities everywhere. The population may now number as low as 1,000 individuals (J. C. Eames <em>in litt.</em> 2007), and so is placed in the band 1,000-2,499 individuals. This equates to 667-1,666 mature individuals, rounded here to 600-1,700 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Heliopais personatus</em> is patchily distributed from north-east <strong>India</strong>&#160;and <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, through <strong>Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong> to Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong>, Sumatra and Java (one record), <strong>Indonesia </strong>(BirdLife International 2001). Populations are apparently in steep decline throughout its range such that its population is now thought to number in the low thousands at most, and possibly fewer than 1,000 mature individuals<strong> </strong>(J.

Its movements are poorly known; it appears to occur as a migrant in parts of the range, but breeding has been reported recently from Cambodia, Myanmar and Bangladesh<strong> </strong>(Neumann-Denzau 2008), and birds are recorded in most seasons in the Sundarbans and Myanmar. No empirical estimates exist for the current rate of decline, but as a species reliant on undisturbed wetlands declines are anticipated across its range given the pressure on riverine and mangrove habitats. Threats in Myanmar (now assumed to be the species's stronghold) remain largely unknown, but several major river systems that have until now remained in a largely natural state, are now threatened by dam development and heavy immigration<strong> </strong>(W.

Preliminary analyses of survey data collected at its breeding sites in Russia have provided evidence that the species's population is indeed undergoing a very rapid decline; clarification of these results may lead to a review of its threat status in the near future. <p></p>","Its breeding habitat is a combination of sparse larch <em>Larix</em> forest for nesting, wet coastal meadows interspersed with piles of driftwood, and coastal mudflats which are used by the adults for feeding. Wintering birds usually frequent estuaries, coastal mudflats and lowland swamps, and sometimes damp meadows, saltpans and rice-fields. <p></p>","The key threats are the development of coastal wetlands throughout Asia for industry, infrastructure and aquaculture, and the degradation of its breeding habitat in Russia by grazing reindeer <em>Rangifer tarandus</em>. Over 90% of its breeding range is unprotected, and in Russia some of its breeding sites are expected to be modified by  pipeline construction and other developments for the oil industry (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">per</span> E.

Moores <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Several other sites that support or formerly supported the species in South Korea have been significantly degraded since the 1980s (N. Moores <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The Rudong coast which apparently forms an important staging site is potentially threatened by habitat loss and degradation owing to a large-scale reclamation project (Q. Bai <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The intertidal flats at Rudong and Dongling are threatened by the invasive grass <em>Spartina</em> (Q. Bai&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Pollution in coastal wetlands, hunting and human disturbance are further threats.

Tong&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016), with possibly the entire world population of the species staging on the intertidal flats of the Rudong coast (Birds Korea 2013). In autumn 2012 c.280 individuals were recorded in the Dongtai area (V. Fu <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Around 500 individuals and at least 10 juveniles were recorded at the Rudong coast from August to October 2015 (Choi and Zhang unpubl. to Q. Bai <em>in litt</em>. 2016).

It is usually found in pairs or small groups (Johnsgard 1981)<strong></strong>, although larger groups sometimes form at roosting sites, often alongside other plover species (Langrand 1990)<strong></strong>. The largest group recorded consisted of 33 birds (Johnsgard 1981, <strong></strong>Langrand 1990)<strong></strong>. It is monogamous, and pairs are highly territorial during the breeding season (Zefania and Szekely 2013).

Hunting for food and trade also exerts a significant pressure throughout its range. In 1989, 40-50 birds were shipped to zoos across South-East Asia. Persecution and disturbance at nesting colonies are thought to be the main threat in Malaysia. The same is said to be the case in South Sumatra, where local people hunt the species and take chicks and eggs for food and domestication (Iqbal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).&#160;Hunting of chicks is thought to have largely impacted subpopulations at&#160;Kumpai lake and&#160;Kuala Puntian&#160;with respective declines of 80% and 73% between 2005 and 2008 (Iqbal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;In Cambodia, exploitation of waterbird eggs and chicks and snaring of adults, for food and trade, coupled with the increasing likelihood of conversion of flooded forest for agriculture, threaten the Tonle Sap lake breeding colony, although the small population here is currently well-protected.

Although it shows a preference for natural wetlands throughout the year, it uses similar artificial habitats like rice paddies for a short period of time, particularly during and after the monsoon season, when natural wetlands may become too deep for foraging (Sundar 2004)<strong></strong>. It will also forage in wet or dry wheat fields and flooded fallow fields, the latter especially in summer when the extent of natural wetlands is reduced (Sundar 2004)<strong></strong>. In Uttar Pradesh, north-central India the species is common in agricultural landscapes, foraging in flooded rice paddies, irrigation canals and roadside ditches (Sundar 2011b).

Consecutive years of drought can cause declines in the population (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> Family CICONIIDAE 1992),&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">though one population in western Uttar Pradesh is resilient to dry years as long as these are interspersed with years of normal and above-normal rainfall (Sundar 2011a). In India, the freshwater wetlands that this species relies upon are under great pressure from expanding human populations (Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004). The most frequent threat to the species in this country is fishing (Santiapillai<em> et al. </em>1997, Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004), which is so intensive in places that even 5-10 cm fishes are taken (Rahmani 1987), followed by the affects of sedimentation on wetland quality (Maheswaran <em>et al. </em>2004).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Illegal conversions of erstwhile community-use wetlands to private fish ponds has severe and large-scale impacts on populations (Sundar <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;However, deterioration of foraging habitat through the conversion of wetlands into agricultural fields is also a major threat in India (Rahmani 1987, Maheswaran 2003a, Sundar 2004, Sundar&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">2011a). In the face of wetland conversions, flooded rice paddies have become important and may be promoting the dispersal of young birds and preventing the fragmentation of sub-populations (Sundar 2004). Eggs are taken in at least some parts of India (Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004). Disturbance during the nesting season is a major threat (Rahmani 1987), &#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">but at least one population in Uttar Pradesh has very high breeding success despite being in a human-dominated agricultural landscape (Sundar 2011a). Traditional mechanisms of conservation of trees (nesting habitat) and wetlands (foraging habitat) combined with legal provisions, and cultivation using low levels of mechanisation in rural India can provide suitable conditions for this species (Sundar 2011a).&#160;Deaths due to collision with electricity wires are occasional in India (Sundar 2005),&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">but are the main cause (c.50%) of deaths of birds of all ages in Australia.&#160;&#160; Death from apparent natural causes and unknown causes were the next equal highest category.&#160; There were only 4 deaths known from collision with wire fences in Australia (Clancy&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016). Additional threats in Sri Lanka include possible inbreeding in small populations, pesticide poisoning of wetlands and loss of mangroves to increasing salinity levels (Santiapillai <em>et al.</em> 1997).

Sea-level rise is projected to have a negative impact upon coastal habitats.

This has however now been seen to be untrue for at least one population that has over 30 breeding pairs (G. Sundar <em>in litt. </em>2016). Drought due to climate change may be a threat, but modelling shows that as long as there are years of normal and above-normal rainfall interspersed with drought years, populations will do well (Sundar 2011a). Improper management of some man-made protected areas in India (for example, Keoladeo National Parin in Rajasthan) has failed to provide adequate environment for this species (G.

In Kigezi district, Uganda, and neighbouring regions in Rwanda and DRC, more than 75% of wetlands were drained between the early 1980s and 2001 (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013). Geographical variation in the conversion of wetlands points to agricultural development being the main cause. On-going and future habitat losses are likely, particularly in western Kenya. Yala Swamp, the largest remaining area of intact papyrus,  is highly threatened by on-going agricultural developments, with further plans to construct dams and embark on aquaculture and industrial development projects, which could render the entire site unsuitable for papyrus (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013). Papyrus swamps are also reported to be declining rapidly in Rwanda, primarily through conversion to agriculture, especially sugar cane plantations, as well as subsistence farming (J. Anderson <em>in litt</em>. 2013, J. Hogg<em> in litt</em>. 2013, C. Nsabagasani <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Papyrus in Rugei Marsh has been completely cleared, followed by the disappearance of the species, and Akanyaru and Nyabarongo have also been heavily affected by crop  production (C. Nsabagasani <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Similar trends and threats are noted in Burundi (L. Ntahuga <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In addition to outright conversion, many smaller swamps are subject to the harvesting of sand and vegetation, with papyrus culms used in construction, handcrafts and fuel, as well as periodic burning and use for fish ponds (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013, M. Odino <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It is noteworthy that, around Lake Victoria, many of these activities have been catalysed by the collapse of the region's fisheries (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013, M. Odino <em>in litt</em>, 2013). Another threat, particularly in urban areas, is dredging for brick-making clay, which is fuelled by rapid economic development (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013).

95970485,12305,Lontra provocax,Endangered,A2cd+3cde,2021,2019-12-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The distribution of the Southern River Otter has declined drastically due to combined pressures from the destruction of habitat, removal of vegetation, river and stream canalization, and extensive dredging (Medina 1996,&#160;Medina-Vogel <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003). At present, poaching is a minor problem but still occurs, particularly south of 43°S latitude where control of hunting is difficult to implement. Extirpation of the Southern River Otter began in local basins but has become widespread. The lack of re-establishment of the species is probably due to high mortality or reproductive failure following the dispersal of otters into unsuitable areas (Medina 1996). This is resulting in a population that is becoming increasingly fragmented and more susceptible to local extinctions through habitat destruction, human disturbance, predation by domestic dogs, and demographic or environmental stochastic events. Genetic studies have confirmed a lower genetic diversity in the northern freshwater subpopulations in comparison to those from the south confirming a past bottleneck probably due to anthropogenic factors (Centron <em>et al.</em> 2008,&#160;Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species has suffered a suspected past population decline of ≥50% over the last 30 years or three generations (based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) in its range countries due to habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, overhunting for the pelt trade, and direct persecution due to retaliation (Chehébar 1990). Accelerating habitat destruction and degradation throughout the Southern River Otter's range is the greatest threat to the species, and is suspected (based on current trends) to lead to a future ≥50% reduction in population size over the next 30 years (three generations based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) for those subpopulations using rivers and lakes (freshwater habitats), and for the subpopulations using the southern fjords and islands (marine habitats) the population decline may be due to the impacts of intensive fishery activities. Therefore, based on the suspected population decline in the past and future, the species is categorised as Endangered under criteria A2cd+3cde.</p>","<p>The Southern River Otter is distributed in the southern temperate forest of South America. This species presents a distribution associated with inland waters in the northern parts of its range, and marine habitat in the southern part of its range. In freshwater habitats otters are associated with the presence of macro-crustaceans from the genus <em>Aegla spp.</em> and <em>Sammastacus spp. </em>(Aued <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al.</em> 2009,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al. </em>2009), which are the otter’s main prey (Medina 1997,&#160;Medina-Vogel and Gonzalez-Lagos 2008,&#160;Fasola <em>et al. </em>2009,&#160;Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011,&#160;Franco <em>et al. </em>2013). Other species of crustaceans, fish and amphibians are also in the otter’s diet but are of marginal occurrence. The species uses rivers with abundant vegetation (Chehebar <em>et al.</em> 1986,&#160;Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2003) and inhabit diverse types of wetlands including Andean lakes, rivers of different sizes, ponds and estuaries. A study using telemetry described an average home range of 11.3 km, with solitary behaviour and a low spatial overlap between individuals of same sex suggesting intrasexual territoriality (Sepúlveda <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the marine range the species uses the marine rocky coast with abundant vegetation cover and low exposure to wind and waves (Sielfeld 1992,&#160;Sielfeld and Castilla 1999). In this environment the Southern River Otter is sympatric with the Marine Otter (<em>L. felina</em>), but the latter is segregated by its use of more wave-exposed coastal areas (Sielfeld 1992,&#160;Ebensperger and Botto-Mahan 1997). The diet in the marine environment is composed of coastal fish of the genera <em>Harpagifer</em>, <em>Patagonotothen</em>, <em>Eleginops</em>, <em>Cottoperca</em> and crustaceans of the genera <em>Munida, Taliepus, Cancridae, Galatheidae, Lithodidae, Lithodes, Paralomis </em>and<em> Campylonotus&#160;</em>(Sielfeld and Castilla 1999,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2013). In general, for both marine and inland waters the Southern River Otter seems to be a specialized aquatic bottom forager preying on slow benthic fish and crustaceans.</p>","The Southern River Otter habitat is very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts (Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). In those subpopulations inhabiting freshwater environments, the high demand for water by human activities such as agriculture, human use, etc. is altering watercourses through canalization and drainage and loss of riparian vegetation. These activities are promoted to increase the amount of agricultural lands but are impacting those otter subpopulations distributed in lowlands, particularly in the Central Valley and the Coastal Range of Chile (Medina-Vogel&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003,&#160;Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). In the case of Andean lakes, where the species occurred historically, the high level of urbanization and tourism has been proposed as the main causes responsible for the local extinction of the species in those areas (Medina 1996). Other threats are poaching (Medina 1996,&#160;Espinosa 2012), predation by free-ranging domestic dogs (Espinosa 2012) and transmission of diseases such as Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014). Free-ranging dogs are an important threat to carnivores because of predation and disease transmission (Vanak and Gompper 2009), and are present in rural and protected areas where the Southern River Otter occurs (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Implementing dog population control measures as well as vaccination programmes are an important measure to mitigate the impact of dogs on this species (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In several parts of the otter's distribution range, hydroelectric dams are installed or are planned to be built in the near future but no research on the potential impact of these on the otters has been conducted so far. The presence of wild exotic salmon and the salmon farming industry are suggested as a potential threat to otter prey leading to potential competition between otters and salmon (Medina 1996,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009) but no studies have confirmed this as yet. In relation to the invasive American Mink (<em>Neovison vison</em>), although several studies have investigated competition between these mustelids and river otters (Medina 1997,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Fasola <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013), there is no clear evidence of a negative effect of the mink on the otter. Indeed, current studies in the marine part of the range suggest a negative effect of otters over minks by habitat (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013) and temporal segregation (Medina‐Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2013). The invasive mink is a potential vector of CDV to otters given their behavioural similarities and sharing of latrines (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Most studies on this species have been made based on indirect signs of the species, hence, there are no estimates of population or subpopulation size. The freshwater subpopulations have been studied more than those in marine environments. Monitoring of signs such as spraints or tracks has been implemented particularly for the population in Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina by the Administration of National Parks for over 30 years (Chehebar 1985, Chehebar <em>et al</em>. 1986, Chehébar and Porro 1998, Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pozzi and Chehebar 2013). A relatively stable otter distribution has been observed in this area with some marginal expansion outside the Nahuel Huapi Park in the Limay River (Carmanchahi <em>et al</em>. 2006). In this population recent volcanic activity during 2011 could have disrupted freshwater ecosystems, consequently affecting the otter population, but there are no studies on the subject, which are of utmost urgency.<br/> <br/> Freshwater subpopulations have been described as fragmented and comprised of seven isolated subpopulations (Medina 1996) but subsequent surveys have identified presence in areas previously thought not to have otters (Rodríguez<em> et al</em>. 2008); it is not clear if this is the result of a recent recolonization or sampling bias in earlier studies, and more research is needed. A radio-telemetry study in the Queule River found densities of 0.25 otters/km of river (Sepúlveda<em> et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Studies of the marine population in Chile indicate that the otter distribution in this environment would be continuous and abundances estimated are 0.57 otters/km of coast (Sielfeld 1992). Studies based on indirect signs in marine populations in Argentina, indicate two separate subpopulations, one in Isla de Los Estados (Provincial Reserve) and the other in Bahia Lapataia, Tierra del Fuego National Park, in the Beagle Channel (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> During 1910–1954 a total of 38,263 otter pelts (<em>Lontra felina</em> and <em>L. provocax</em>) were exported from Chile but after that period no exports exist due to the implementation of different laws and international agreements (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986).",Decreasing,"The Southern River Otter occurs in Chile and Argentina in freshwater and marine environments. The freshwater distribution is located in the northern part of the otter’s range and was historically wider in both countries. In Chile, river otters occurred from Cachapoal River (34ºS) (Gay 1847, Reed 1877) up to the Peninsula de Taitao (46ºS) with a continuous distribution in rivers and lakes (Medina 1996). The current distribution in Chile has been strongly restricted from north to south due to land use change and human colonization (Medina 1996), as a consequence, the otter populations are only found at present from the Imperial River (38ºS) (Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011) to the south. &#160;In Argentina freshwater subpopulations were distributed historically from the Neuquen Province (36ºS) to the Lake Buenos Aires (46ºS) and mostly associated with water courses from the Andean Range and the steppe (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012). The present freshwater distribution in Argentina is mostly restricted to the Limay watershed, mainly within the Nahuel Huapi National Park (Chehebar 1985, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Southern River Otter subpopulations that inhabit marine environments are distributed along the Pacific coast of Chile from 46ºS to Tierra del Fuego in Chile (Cabrera 1957, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Sielfeld 1992, Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Argentina, marine subpopulations are present only in the Archipielago Fueguino in Los Estados Island and the Beagle Channel (Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006, Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2012, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). Marine river otters in Argentina are probably a continuous subpopulation of the main otter subpopulation in Chile (Sielfeld 1992).",The species is hunted for their pelts which are used to make clothing.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The Southern River Otter is listed on CITES Appendix I and listed on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Appendix I.<br/> <br/> In Chile, the conservation status is listed by the Reglamento de Clasificación de Especies as Endangered in VI, VII, VIII, IX, XIV and X Districts and as Data Deficient in XI and XII Districts (Chile 2011). In Chile, the Subsecretaria de Pesca is the governmental agency responsible of their conservation and management. In those populations inside official protected areas the Corporacion Nacional Forestal is responsible for their conservation. National Action plans in Chile are developed by the Minisiterio del MedioAmbiente, but despite its conservation status, no Action Plan exists for this species at present, which is the most urgent conservation action priority. Hunting is prohibited since 1929 in Chile (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986) and the governmental agency responsible for hunting permits and enforcement is the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero.<br/> <br/> In Argentina, the conservation status is Endangered (EN A3cd) (Valenzuela et al. 2012). At national level, the governmental agency responsible of native wildlife conservation and management is the Secretaría de Ambiente y DesarrolloSustentable de la Nación through the Dirección de Fauna Silvestre. The Administración de Parques Nacionales (National Parks Administration) is responsible for conservation of those populations inside the national protected areas, where the species is classified as Special Value Species (APN 1994.). The two populations in Argentina from freshwater and marine habitats are mostly inside national protected areas.<br/> Because of the several agencies involved in the management of the species a strong coordination with clear responsibilities and a work agenda is a major urgency in the short term.

Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa. A continuing population decline of at least 10% in a&#160;90 year three generation period,&#160;is anticipated based on continuing and increasing anthropogenic threats (Vulnerable C1).<br/><br/>The African Manatee therefore qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>West and Central Africa contain a variety of suitable habitats for Manatees ranging from large and small rivers, coastal estuaries, freshwater and saltwater lagoons, shallow quiet coastal bays, lakes and reservoirs. Like <em>T. manatus</em>, <em>T. senegalensis</em> inhabits practically every accessible habitat (Powell 1996, Dodman <em>et al.</em> 2008). They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012).

However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

It attains 100 mm within its first year, spawning at two to three years of age when males reach 15 cm and females 25 cm with females capable of laying 250,000 eggs, and lives to about six years (Skelton 1993). Spawns in shallow river channels and floodplains and margins of dams (Mulder 1973, Tomassen <em>et al</em>. 1985).","There are several threats to rivers where <em>L. umbratus</em> occurs but some of these may have resulted in benefits to this species, for example, construction of dams and weirs, increased eutrophication due to waste water treatment releases into rivers which increase levels of detritus, algae and zooplankton on which this species feeds. Hybridization between historically-isolated lineages of this species has already occurred in the Sundays River due to inter-basin transfer schemes between the Great Fish and Sundays Rivers (Ramoejane 2016). Heavy pollution due to industries and sewage overflow in the Gauteng Province has resulted in fish kills in the Vaal System and may have led to short term population fluctuations in sections of the Vaal River. Alien fishes (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) and habitat deterioration threaten the population in the Bushmans and Gourits River systems. The effect of African Sharptooth Catfish (<em>Clarias gariepinus</em>) invasions in the Gamtoos and Gourits systems is not well understood.","The species seems to be abundant in slow-flowing reaches of rivers and thrives in dams such as the Vaal and Bloemhof dams on the Vaal River (Mulder 1973). There are many populations (native to six separate river systems). According to genetic variation between populations, only three main populations exist and can be classified as evolutionary significant units (ESUs) (Ramoejane 2016). These are the Orange, South Western (Gourits and Gamtoos) and South Eastern populations (Sundays, Bushmans, Great Fish, Keiskamma, Buffalo and Nahoon). Genetic divergence between the population from the southern-flowing systems in the Eastern and Western Cape and that from the Orange-Vaal System is extensive (Ramoejane 2016) and may require further taxonomic investigation. Within each major population grouping, there are several subpopulations (both lentic and lotic). There is no information about population trends for each of the populations or ESUs but if there is decline it is not suspected to be significant.",Unknown,"The species is relatively widespread geographically in South Africa, occurring in the Orange-Vaal, Gourits, Gamtoos, Sundays, Bushmans, Great Fish, Keiskamma, Buffalo and Nahoon Rivers, and also the Orange River system in Lesotho and Namibia (Skelton 2001, Ramoejane 2016). It appears to be uncommon in the lower Orange River, and was not recorded by Naesje <em>et al</em>. (2007) during detailed fish surveys there. It is suspected to have been translocated to the Keiskamma, Buffalo and Nahoon River systems in the Eastern Cape Province (Skelton 2001, Ramoejane 2016) and to the Olifants catchment of the Limpopo River System in Mpumalanga Province in South Africa (Skelton 2001). The species thrives in impoundments in its native and introduced ranges (Mulder 1973). There may be other areas where this species has become established due to inter-basin transfer schemes from the Orange-Vaal River System.",The species is a detritivore and is thus rarely caught by anglers despite its good size. It however has been an important component of commercial net fisheries when these were operational in seven state dams in the Free State Province (Barkhuizen 2015). There are increasing reports of illegal netting (without permits) in rivers and dams of the Orange-Vaal System.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"There are a number of protected areas (e.g. National Parks, provincial nature reserves) that encompass parts of rivers and dams where <em>L. umbratus</em> occurs. Introductions associated with Orange-Fish (Orange and Great Fish rivers) and Cookhouse (Great Fish and Sundays Rivers) inter-basin water transfer schemes have resulted in hybridization between the previously-isolated Orange River and southern lineages of <em>L. umbratus</em>. Although hybridization between these lineages is not frequent or extensive, further translocations of individuals of genetically-differentiated (i.e. Orange-Vaal, South-western and South-eastern) populations among river systems and impoundments, such as Kat River (Great Fish River) and Slagboom (Sundays River), should be avoided (Ramoejane 2016).",Afrotropical,,false,false,"Global, Pan-Africa & S.

Juveniles were also found to be common in rocky areas of the Batoka Gorge below Victoria Falls, Middle Zambezi River. Adults prefer deep quiet water in sheltered environments such as lagoons and large rivers (Tweddle and Willoughby 1982).

Historical declines occurred prior to the early 1960s which precedes a three generation interval period and therefore, Murray Cod does not qualify for listing under criterion A. However, there is concern regarding some populations and regions.","<p>Murray Cod lives in a wide range of habitats, from clear, rocky streams to slow flowing, turbid rivers and billabongs. This species typically favours deeper water but can also be found in fast flowing shallow areas at times. It occupies a broad range of flowing and standing waters but is considered a main river channel specialist, selecting channel habitats in the river, floodplain channels in high flood and also channels within Lake Mulwala (SMDB) (Koehn 2009b). It is found in a wide variety of habitats from deep, turbid, slow-flowing lowland rivers through to fast flowing, clear and rocky highland streams (Koehn 2009a, 2009b; Koehn and Nicol 2014; Mallen-Cooper and Zampatti 2015). Adults and YOY select similar micro habitats based on structural variables regardless of site of hydrologic conditions (Koehn 2009b). They show strong ordination with high densities of structural woody habitat at microhabitat (Koehn 2009b) and river reach scales (Boys et al. 2006). In lowland rivers they show a high affinity for structural woody habitat (&gt; 75% cover), water depth (2.8 m), proximity to the bank and high surface flows (0.37 ms<sup>-1</sup>) (Koehn and Nicol 2014).</p><p>This species reportedly can grow to 1.8 m in length and 113.6 kg in weight, however, most fish caught now weigh less then 5 kg and are less than 600 mm long (Lintermans 2007). It reaches maturity at 4-6 y; at 2 kg and 500 mm (females) and 0.7 kg and 400 mm (males) (Cadwallader and Gooley 1985, Gooley <em>et al.</em> 1995, Rowland 1988b). Size at age and sexual maturity can vary throughout its range. Fecundity is generally related to size of female (6-10 000 eggs for 2-3 kg; 40 000 for 5 kg; 90 000 for 23 kg, up to 200 000 in very large fish (Lake 1967; Rowland 1998b). It has large, adhesive eggs 3-3.5 mm diam. (Cadwallader 1979, Cadwallader and Gooley 1984, Gooley <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 1995, Rowland 1988a). </p><p>  The species spawns in spring/summer each year regardless of river discharge (Humphries 2005; Koehn and Harrington 2006) with rising water temperatures of &gt;15°C (Humphries 2005, Koehn and Harrington 2006); 16.5-23.5°C with peak spawning ≈ 20°C (Cadwallader and Gooley 1985; Gooley <em>et al.</em> 1995; Rowland 1985, 1998a). Eggs are laid on hard substrate such as logs, rocks and clay surfaces (Cadwallader 1979, Cadwallader and Gooley 1984, Gooley <em>et al.</em> 1995, Rowland 1988a, Lintermans 2009). Males exhibit parental care and guard eggs in the nest (Rowland 1998a) which hatch within one to two weeks (Lintermans 2007).&#160;Incubation period and hatch rates depend largely on water temperatures but hatching usually begins 6 d after fertilisation and takes 2-4 d. Larvae rise in water column and undergo downstream drift (Humphries <em>et al.</em> 2002; Koehn and Harrington 2005, 2006) for 5-7 d (Humphries 2005, Koehn 2006). Larvae have large yolk-sacs and feed endogenously for 8-12 d. The species exhibits variable growth among different habitats and regions (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 1992) with maximum length greater in impoundments than rivers (Forbes <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Males are marginally larger than females at a given age (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 1992) and length and age at maturity can vary within and among populations (Forbes <em>et al.</em> 2015). Growth rates significantly increase above 18.5°C (Ryan <em>et al</em>. 2003) with no demonstrated increased growth at 15.5°C (Ryan <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;</p><p>It was once considered to be relatively sedentary (Reynolds 1983) although individual movements up to 1,498 km had been recorded but rarely (Anon 1971). Generally, they have limited home ranges and high site fidelity for most of the year but can opportunistically undertake large-scale movements (&lt;120 km) with homing behaviour common (Koehn and Nicol 1997, Koehn 2007, Koehn <em>et al.</em> 2009, Leigh and Zampatti 2013, Koehn and Nicol 2016). Limited movement is displayed over the short-term (Jones and Stuart 2007) but juveniles<strong>&#160;</strong>are&#160;considered to move longer distances, as high numbers of 450 mm (juvenile) fish have been observed moving through Torrumbarry fishway. In rivers, adult upstream spawning migration is cued by temperature and increased flows undertaken from August to January to a second site, usually followed by a rapid downstream movement (December/January) with around two thirds of fish returning to their original home site, mostly within several weeks after spawning (Koehn <em>et al.</em> 2009). Most individuals remain within a 10 km stretch of river for much of their lives but some adults have been recorded moving distances of up to 130 km upstream coinciding with spawning (Koehn <em>et al.</em> 2009). The timing of movements was not synchronous amongst individuals with variation exhibited between individuals, sizes, original location and years. Fish &gt;650 mm moved further than fish &lt;650 mm and fish from Lake Mulwala moved further than Ovens River fish (Koehn 2006, Koehn <em>et al.</em> 2009). There is large variation in individual movements with one fish recaptured 1224 km upstream after 488 d and another 12 km downstream after 4431 d (Llewellyn 2014). They exhibit high fidelity to anabranch habitats and moved extensively between anabranches and the main channel during a flood and associated hypoxic blackwater event, suggesting that the use of ephemeral floodplain habitats is limited (Leigh and Zampatti 2013). Move extensively between anabranches and the main river channel (Koehn <em>et al</em>. 2009, Leigh and Zampatti 2013) and move between the main channel and floodplains during high-discharge periods, returning to channel habitats (Jones 2007, 2009). It is known to have become stranded behind floodplain regulators (Jones and Stuart 2008).

Equivalent data from South Australia indicate that Murray Cod stocks declined sharply in the early 1960s (Zampatti <em>et al.</em> 2014). These declines represent &gt; 80% declines in populations of Murray Cod. There is no evidence of significant population recovery of commercial catches of Murray Cod up until the closure of commercial fisheries for Murray Cod in 2001 (NSW) and 2003 (South Australia). However, given they occurred 55-65 years ago, these declines occurred in a period that exceeds even conservative estimates of three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fishery independent surveys of Murray Cod CPUE commenced in NSW in 1994, in South Australia in 2002 (Zampatti <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and range-wide in 2004/05 (Sustainable Rivers Audit/Murray-Darling Basin Fish Surveys). A number of regional-scale assessments of Murray Cod CPUE have commenced within the past two decades. While a small portion of these report declines in CPUE (Gilligan 2013, Gwinn <em>et al. </em>unpublished data, Tonkin<em> et al.</em> 2018) at local scales associated with major population disturbance events (i.e. primarily hypoxic/black-water events), the consensus of results at broader spatial scales and which have continued to generate data following the hypoxic/black-water events in parts of its range of 2010/11 and 2011/12 is that populations of Murray Cod have either remained stable (Zampatti <em>et al.</em> 2014, Tonkin<em> et al.</em> 2018), or have increased in abundance/reporting rates&#160;(Raymond<em> et al.</em> 2013, Lyon <em>et al. </em>2014, Tonkin <em>et al.</em> 2016, Tonkin <em>et al.</em> 2018). Analysis of the longest time series of fishery independent data available, 25 year time-series data from 34 sites occupied by Murray Cod in NSW indicate a significant increasing trajectory of CPUE since 1994 (NSW DPI unpublished data).<br/><br/>While populations have not yet recovered to pre-1950s levels, Murray Cod do not qualify as threatened under criterion A as having suffered a population size reduction within a period representing three generation lengths.",Increasing,"Murray Cod is endemic to all major catchments within the Murray-Darling Basin with the exception of the Wimmera River, Victoria, within which translocated populations occur. There are no known records of the species within the Castlereagh Catchment, however, that valley is surrounded on all sides with endemic Murray Cod populations. Within this range, Murray Cod occurs throughout most of the larger waterways, except for the highland regions of the southern tributaries. The species remains present across much of its former distribution, although abundances have declined (Cadwallader and Gooley 1984) and it has become sparsely distributed in reaches affected by thermal pollution below major impoundments and is now very rarely found in the Paroo River.<br/><br/>Murray Cod has been translocated widely outside and within&#160;its natural range. Whilst many populations persisted for several years, few self-sustaining populations have established.&#160;Introduced populations persist in some waterways, impoundments or artificial lakes in Queensland, NSW, the ACT, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. Murray Cod are exported internationally for aquaculture.","During the mid to late 1800s, a large commercial fishery developed and was based mainly on the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers (Macleay<em> et al.&#160;</em>1880, Dannevig 1903, Stead 1903). There was a gradual decline in the overall catch from a peak in 1918, and by the mid 1930s the fishery had become unprofitable for large operators (Whitley 1937, Pollard and Scott 1966). Between the mid 1950s and 1960s there was a dramatic decline in the abundance of Murray Cod in inland NSW and a concurrent decline in the commercial catch of Murray Cod in South Australia (Reynolds 1976). Catch remained at a low level (Reid<em> et al.</em> 1997) and the NSW fishery closed in 2001 and the South Australian fishery in 2003. This species is no longer commercially fished.

This species is typically found at depths &lt;12 m, but has been recorded to 91.5 m. This guitarfish has a generation length of 9 years and exhibits an annual reproductive cycle with litters of 1-16 pups.<br/><br/>In Mexican waters, this species is taken in directed artisanal elasmobranch fisheries in both the Gulf of California and on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is also retained as bycatch by demersal trawls and gillnets. This guitarfish is the most heavily targeted batoid in north Pacific Mexico.

This species also occurs commonly in intertidal waters (&lt;1 m depth) to feed (J. Bizzarro, pers. comm. 2016). In Baja California, gravid females come during the spring and summer to give birth in shallow bays and estuaries (Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, Márquez-Farías 2007). Based on fisheries landings, males arrive in late summer to mate and then all individuals depart in the fall (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Considerable information on reproductive biology and age-growth has been gathered for this species from both the west coast of Baja California Sur (BCS) in Mexico (Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, González-García 1998, Downton-Hoffmann 2001, Márquez-Farías 2007) and from Californian waters in the USA (Miller and Lea 1972, Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983, Timmons and Bray 1997). Life history parameters of Shovelnose Guitarfish can be quite different based on the location that the samples were taken, and the method of measuring the parameters.<br/><br/>This species is aplacental viviparous (bears live young nourished from a yolk sac) and has a continuous reproductive cycle. Gestation takes 4 to 5 months (Márquez-Farías 2007). Pregnant females may contain uterine capsules and large ripe ova in both ovaries at the same time, but the reproductive cycle is annual with a single litter per year (Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, Márquez-Farías 2007). Fecundity has been reported as 1 to 10 pups/litter (average five; Márquez-Farías 2007) and 6 to 16 pups/litter (Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993), with a 1:1 sex ratio at birth (Márquez-Farías 2007). Size at birth ranges from 20 to 24 cm TL (in San Quintin Bay, Baja California, Mexico; Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993), 15 cm TL (in Almejas Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico; Eschmeyer et al. 1983), and 17.5 cm TL (in Sonora, Mexico; Márquez-Farías 2007). Multiple estimates also exist for size at maturity ranging from 57–99 cm TL for females (Timmons and Bray 1997, Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, Downton-Hoffman 1996, Márquez-Farías 2007) and &lt;63–110 cm TL for males (Timmons and Bray 1997, Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, Downton-Hoffman 1996, Dubois 1981, Talent 1985, Márquez-Farías 2007). Age at maturity is estimated at 7 years for females and 7 to 8.4 years for males (Timmons and Bray 1997). Maximum size is estimated at 156 cm TL for females (Baxter 1966) and 114 cm TL for males (Downton-Hoffman 1996). Longevity is estimated at 11 years (Timmons and Bray 1997). Generation length is estimated to be 9 years (Timmons and Bray 1997).","The primary threat to the Shovelnose Guitarfish is most likely the directed artisanal fisheries in Mexico (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2007). Pregnant females are frequently caught in the artisanal gillnet fishery on the west coast of Baja California (Salazar-Hermoso and Villavicencio 1999, Bizzarro 2005) and the coast of Sonora, Gulf of California, Mexico (Márquez-Farias 2002). Gillnet selectivity analysis revealed that mature individuals were most susceptible to capture in the fishery (Márquez-Farías 2005, Márquez-Farías 2011). Neonates and small juveniles are much less abundant in the directed fishery (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The Shovelnose Guitarfish is also taken as bycatch in demersal trawls (especially shrimp trawlers), and gillnets in Mexican waters. The high catches of mature individuals either by the directed artisanal fishery or in indirect landings most likely are having an effect on the population structure as well as the overall abundance of guitarfish (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2007, Márquez-Farías 2011). In the Bahía Almejas summer batoid fishery, this species is the most abundant in June landings (<em>ca</em>. 51% of catch, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) = 21.8 individuals/vessel/day) landings and third most abundant in August landings (<em>ca</em>. 13%, CPUE=2.8 individuals/vessel/day). Catches of the fishery in Bahía Almejas, Baja California has steeply declined after greatly increased effort in the mid to late 1990s and its abundance has almost surely declined in this region as a result of fishing pressure. In Sonora, Mexico, the Shovelnose Guitarfish is the most abundant batoid landed in the artisanal elasmobranch fishery (Márquez-Farías 2002, Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009). In addition, the fishing derbies of Elkhorn Slough seem to have similarly drastically reduced the abundance of Shovelnose Guitarfish (Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>In the United States, this species is taken by recreational anglers to a limited extent and occasionally sold in local Asian markets in southern California.<br/><br/>The second largest threat to the Shovelnose Guitarfish is habitat modification. Many embayments and estuaries in the northwest Pacific region of Mexico are being modified for shrimp farming. Since this species uses these areas for feeding and reproduction, this could have a detrimental impact on its abundance in affected areas. In United States waters, many of the bays and estuaries have been modified, degraded or destroyed, restricting the coastal areas that can be used by the Shovelnose Guitarfish. It is unclear, however, whether this would significantly impact the survival, fecundity or population resilience of the species.","There is little information on the population status or trend for this species. Along the coast of northwest Mexico, including the Pacific coast of Baja California and around the Gulf of California, the Shovelnose Guitarfish is the most commonly landed elasmobranch species in the artisanal fisheries (Márquez-Farias 2002, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2009, Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Bahía Almejas, Baja California elasmobranch fisheries reportedly targeted aggregations of this species. Despite this, researchers did not observe any negative effects on this species at the time of these surveys (1991-1995; Salazar-Hermoso and Villavicencio-Garayzar 1999). The Shovelnose Guitarfish was also the elasmobranch species most captured in the upper Gulf of California (Marquez-Farias 2002, Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2009). It should be noted, however, that catch data reported as the Shovelnose Guitarfish may also include catches of Banded Guitarfish (<em>Zapteryx exasperata</em>). High fishing pressure recorded in this species could cause population declines, so this species should be monitored closely (Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Mexican logbooks from fisheries targeting elasmobranchs group guitarfish under a general category, and these data show that reported guitarfish catches have ranged from &gt;1,000 metric tonnes (mt) live weight in 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2014; to between 846 and 937 mt in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2013 (CONAPESCA 2006-2014). Changes in Mexican fishing effort are difficult to detect, but effort is estimated to be relatively stable. Because all guitarfishes are grouped under a general category, population declines for this species may go undetected.<br/><br/>Landings of the Shovelnose Guitarfish are monitored in Californian waters, and have declined from 9.26-10.31 tonnes (t) in 2000-2002 to 0.13–1.05 t in 2012–2014 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2000-2014). This is likely due to the reduction and redistribution of fishing pressure in the range of this species, and thus may not be correlated with a decline in abundance in Californian waters. In Elkhorn Slough, California, historical data from fishing derbies indicate that catches of the Shovelnose Guitarfish declined by 78% over three generations from the 1950s to the 1970s, and by the mid-1990s catches had undergone a 92% decline from 1950s levels (Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, these declines were recorded at the northern extent of this species range, and may be the result of changing environmental conditions, rather than a population decline driven by fishing. In southern California, the Shovelnose Guitarfish was found to be abundant in a small, restored coastal habitat (Farrugia <em>et al</em>. 2011) as well as in San Diego Bay (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2002).",Decreasing,"This species is reported in coastal waters from San Francisco Bay, California to the southern Gulf of California, Mexico (Miller and Lea 1972, Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983).",This species is utilized for its meat and fins.,Marine,"There are currently no species-specific conservation measures in place in United States or Mexican waters.<br/><br/>In Mexico, a moratorium on the allocation of additional elasmobranch fishing permits was enacted in 1993, but no formal management plan has been implemented for the Shovelnose Guitarfish specifically. Mexico implemented a National Plan of Action (NPOA) in 2004, and began reporting some species-specific data to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). However, only 10% of catches were reported to species level in 2010, with most being grouped by order and above. The United States implemented a NPOA in 2001, with 25% of catches being reported to species level (Fischer <em>et al</em>. 2012). In 2007 Mexican officials approved Regulation NOM-029 which required fisheries targeting sharks to establish a logbook system, regulate fishing gear for small and medium sized fleets, and define areas where fishing is restricted. This species is recorded in these target fisheries, along with other guitarfish species, under the general category of ""pez guitarra"". In 2012 Mexico also developed a fishing ban on the Pacific Coast that takes place from May 31 to July 31. These efforts should help improve species-specific data, and provide an essential basis for detecting fishery trends and are needed throughout the species’ range.<br/><br/>In Californian waters, a network of 29 marine protected areas (MPAs) were implemented in 2007 under California's Marine Life Protection Act, representing approximately 204 square miles (~18%) of state waters in the central coast region (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2000–2014). Due to these MPAs, most trawlers are restricted to operating in deeper waters, and only in central and northern California. As a result, fishing effort in the California trawl fishery has been reduced, and catches of this species have also likely been reduced (D. Ebert pers. obs. 2007). Finally, restoration of coastal habitats along the California coast provides areas for Shovelnose Guitarfish to feed, breed and escape predators, and there is evidence that these restored habitats are being used by this species (Farrugia <em>et al</em>. 2011).","",,false,false,Global

It is benthopelagic at depths of 0–60 m, and possibly to a depth of 90 m. The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple demersal fishing gears, including trawl, gillnet, and set net, and is retained for human consumption or fish meal.<br/><br/>It has undergone a localised population reduction of 81% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) in Ariake Bay, Japan, due to a predator control program. Elsewhere, there are no species-specific time series, although catches of skates and rays from across the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs indicate declines of 46–96% over the past three generation lengths (36 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical fishing pressure was high, and it remains high in China, and to a lesser extent in South Korea, but has declined in Japan over the past 30 years. Across its range the species is still considered common and the inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species some refuge. It is suspected that the Naru Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>","The Naru Eagle Ray is benthopelagic and semi-oceanic over the continental shelf from the surface to 60 m depth, and possibly to 90 m depth (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It enters estuarine waters to breed and use as nursery grounds, and in southern Japan, schools move inshore in summer months and move offshore in winter (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2005, White <em>et al. </em>2013, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm disc width (DW), males are mature by ~ 80 cm DW and female size-at-maturity is estimated as ~95 cm DW (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with a litter size of 1<a name=""_Hlk20403143"">–</a>7 embryos reported and a size-at-birth of 33–35 cm DW (White <em>et al.</em> 2013, Last&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016, A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Female age-at-maturity is 7 years and maximum age is 19 years, thus generation length is 12 years (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2005).","<p>The Naru Eagle Ray is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple demersal fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set net, and longline, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). <br/></p>  <p>In Japan, this species is targeted in a predator control program implemented in Ariake Bay in 2001 to protect commercially important bivalves as the Longnose Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus flagellum</em>)<em>,&#160;</em>and presumably the Naru Eagle Ray, feeds on these bivalves  (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2005). Up to 10,000 individual eagle rays (which includes this species, Longnose Eagle Ray and the Japanese Eagle Ray<em>,&#160;Myliobatis tobijei</em>) have been targeted in gillnets annually as part of the program. Across Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013 (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019). In South Korea, the Naru Eagle Ray is occasionally captured (C.-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019). Fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014). </p>  <p></p><p></p><p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region. <a name=""_Hlk35497192"">In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of tidal flats since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). </a>In the East China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands (Heileman and Tang 2009). In Viet Nam, large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995).<br/></p>","The Naru Eagle Ray is common in coastal habitats over shallow tidal flats (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). In Japan, this species' abundance has declined by 50% in Ariake Bay over the past 15 years, where it is targeted in a predator control program (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2005). This represents a decline of 81% over the past three generation lengths (36 years). Prior to the implementation of the program, the population of eagle rays (which also includes the Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis tobie</em>i)), had been increasing in Ariake Bay (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2005). The average maximum size of Naru Eagle Ray individuals in Ariake Bay appears to be decreasing (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019) and in the Seto Inland Sea, research from 2004 to 2012<a name=""_Hlk20403143""></a> found the abundance of larger Naru Eagle Rays (&gt;120 cm disc width) decreased after 2008 (Shimamoto<em> et al.</em> 2019).    <p><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">In Japan, the catch of all skates and rays combined from 1955 to 1995 showed a decline of 79% from a peak catch of 18,782 t in 1955 to 3,985 t in 1995 (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2002). This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in catches in the East China Sea which consisted mostly of small <em>Okamejei</em> species (not identified to species level). Catches of skates and rays in the East China Sea declined by 77% from 1955 to 1986 (Ishihara <em>et al. </em>2002). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of rays and skates in the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</a></p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the South Korea, China, and Viet Nam EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011). In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In Viet Nam, there were minimal catches from 1950 to 1980 that then rose steeply during the mid-1980s to a peak of 1,515 t in 1990 followed by a steady decline to 182 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;<a name=""_Hlk24453985"">There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson<em> et al.</em> 2013).</a></p>  <p></p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk24453985""></a>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (36 years), they represent declines of 75%, 94%, 46%, and 96% in&#160;Japan, South Korea, China, and Viet Nam respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Significant localised depletion of the Naru Eagle Ray in Ariake Bay is evident with a population reduction of 84% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to the predator control program. Historical fishing pressure was high across the spatial and depth range of the Naru Eagle Ray, and it remains high in China, and to a lesser extent South Korea, but has declined in Japan over the past 30 years. Across its range the species is still considered common and the inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species some refuge.

In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial bottom trawling in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). Further research is needed on population size and trends, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.  </p>","",,false,false,Global

It is restricted to freshwater systems and has only been recorded from rivers in Nigeria and Cameroon. It is mostly caught as bycatch in net gear and retained. The meat is used for human consumption, either fresh or salted and dried. There is a long history of fishing by communities along these rivers with high and increasing fishing pressure and reports indicating that fish abundance and diversity have declined, across the species' entire known range. Its distribution is adjacent to heavily populated areas, making it easily accessible to fishers.<br/><br/>Overall, this species has a small area of occupancy (AOO = 1,392 km²) and its distribution is severely fragmented. It is known from five locations with continuing declines in area, quality of habitat, and population size. <span style="""">Each habitat patch (= a location for this species) is separated from other habitat patches either by a great overland distance or by dams (e.g.,&#160;construction of dams in the Niger-Benue system).

Considering the&#160;limited recent records and anecdotal accounts of local extinction in some areas, it is suspected that the Smooth Stingray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (14 years) due to declines in habitat quality and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.</span></p><p><br/></p>","The Smooth Stingray occurs in freshwater river systems up to 1,300 km from the coast in both deep and shallow sections of rivers (Alum-Udensi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016,&#160;Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). It reaches a maximum size of 36 cm disc width (DW) (Taniuchi 1991, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b),&#160; males mature at &lt;26–30 cm DW and females mature at&#160;~26–32 cm DW (Thorson and Watson 1975, Taniuchi 1991).&#160;Reproduction is viviparous and size-at-birth is about 8 cm DW, but little else is known of its biology (Taniuchi 1991). Female age-at-maturity is estimated as ~2 years and maximum age estimated to be 7 years, resulting in an estimated generation length of 4.5 years (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2005).","<p>The Smooth Stingray is taken as bycatch in the large variety of fishing gear used by fishing communities along West African river systems which include beach seines, gillnets, weirs, traps, castnets, hook and line, longlines and other traditional artisanal gear such as local fish ponds (Knaap 1994, Abowei and Hart 2008). Juveniles and adults are also targeted in fishing communities where there are beliefs that medicine prepared from the Smooth Stingray reduce labour pains in women as well as to keep up with the demand for their spines as collectibles or to be used in arrow-heads (Alum-Udensi <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p><p>This species is subjected to intense, unmanaged fishing pressure across its limited range (Alum-Udensi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Reports indicate that along the Benue River in Nigeria, fishing effort more than doubled in the period 1986–1991 from 839 fishers in 1986 to 1,811 fishers in 1991 (Knaap 1994). This was in parallel to a reported increase in the number of longlines and traps used from 1,465 in 1986 to 10,820 in 1989 (Knaap 1994). The increasing demand for fish is driven by human population growth which has increased settlements by local communities along river banks (Alum-Udensi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). For example, the population of Lokoja town in Nigeria doubled within two decades (Alum-Udensi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p><p>Fishers in Cameroon have attributed declines of this species to frequent local droughts.&#160;Indeed, local droughts have been notable in the region with rates of water flows having their lowest recorded since the beginning of the century by 1980–1990 leading to drastic reductions in floodplain surfaces and the draining of some sections of the Niger River and impacting fish species&#160;(Lae&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003).&#160;</p><p>The freshwater habitat in which the Smooth Stingray has been recorded is threatened by habitat loss and degradation (Knaap 1994, Abowei and Hart 2008). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of various areas and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture and fish production); the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation from dredging; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Alum-Udensi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;In fact, over the last thirty years, almost all the main rivers in the region have been damned at least in one location and have gradually become artificially engineered with the building of embankments, free-flow canals, and irrigation ditches (GCLME 2006, Dumas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). The fragmentation of these freshwater systems has led to drastic changes in river flows and abrupt modifications in the hydrological conditions along deltas and estuaries including the elimination of regular flooding in the wet season leading to the loss of lagoons as well as sediment in catchment areas due to the entrapment of silt behind dams (Dumas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). These changes and habitat loss due to dam development have likely affected the distribution and abundance of this species and there are concerns about the number of additional proposed dams in several West African countries (e.g., 38 potential dam sites identified in Gabon) (Cutler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p>","<span style="""">There is no population size estimate or trends in abundance for the Smooth Stingray, but its restricted distribution implies that the population size is small. The population status is inferred from reports of capture records and the evidence of decline and range contraction is suspected from largely&#160;anecdotal accounts. A continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is suspected due to increasing fishing operations and habitat alterations across its known range. It is now considered rare or even locally extinct in some areas where it was previously considered a common species. While records of this species still exist, the time between records is long which could indicate the population is still declining.&#160;Given these areas still have fisheries with little or no regulation, it is likely the population will continue to decline.<br/></span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);""><br/></span>The Smooth Stingray was likely common in the past and was recorded through historical accounts and fisheries surveys in both Nigeria and Cameroon (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;A declining population in this reported former main centre of abundance, the Niger-Benue system, is suggested by sequential attempts to collect these rays in both countries (Stauch and Blanc 1962, Thorson and Watson 1975). In Nigeria, in December 1972 and January 1973, it was regularly found at local fish markets in the Benue Plateau with at least 1–2 specimens sold weekly during the dry season (Thornson and Watson 1975). It was also reported from a two-year survey of artisanal fisheries in the lower Nun River, Niger Delta, Nigeria (as&#160;<em>Potamotrygon gorovensis</em>) but information on quantities recorded was not available (Abowei and Hart 2008). More recently, twelve individuals were collected from the wild in Nigeria to determine if these species could be viable for the aquarium trade, but additional information on abundance is not available (Alum-Udensi and Nlewadim 2016). It has not been recorded from fisheries monitoring of Nigerian marine and inland artisanal fisheries (A. B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). In freshwater systems where the Smooth Stingray occurs, such as the Niger River, fish production decreased by half from 90,000 t in 1969 to 45,000 t in 1986 and has continued to decline since with reported changes in fish abundance and diversity&#160;due to long drought periods, the building of dams, and a rapid increase in fishing activities (Lae&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003).<br/><br/>In Cameroon, in 1960, this species was found in large numbers throughout the year captured by fishers along the Benue Basin in the Garoua region in Cameroon (Stauch and Blanc 1962). Here, fishers from the region called this species 'the scorpion of the water' (<em>naire diam</em> in Foulbe language and <em>konama raw</em> in Haoussa language) to describe their frequent encounters and the wounds inflicted by the stingers as they were fishing (Stauch and Blanc 1962). Between November 1985 and January 1986, 34 specimens were collected during a survey of the Sanaga Basin in Cameroon suggesting that it was fairly common in this location (Taniuchi 1991). More recently, it was not recorded from two years of fish landing site surveys in coastal Cameroon, where many fishers land their catches even if fishing upstream rivers. Furthermore, interviews with fishers indicate that this species disappeared from these areas between 5–10 years ago (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). According to local fishers, the Smooth Stingray has declined or disappeared at Garoua in the Benue River in Cameroon, where it was formerly abundant (Fowler<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;The last record of this species from this location was reported in 1989, and it might have disappeared due to the degradation of its habitat resulting from the construction of dams on the Benue river and other rivers (Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).<br/><br/>Overall, while there are some relatively recent records of this species from Nigeria, there are no confirmed records from Cameroon. Even though there have been recent surveys focused on sharks and rays in this region, it is important to note that these have been limited and further work is required to locate any remnant populations. However, the ease o<span style="""">f access to their entire distribution, the high fishing pressure, and the increasingly fragmented and degraded habitat it occupies are a cause for concern.

Fishing communities along the River Niger (e.g., Itobe, Geregu, and Shintaku) utilize the Smooth Stingray for medicinal purposes. Medicine prepared from juveniles or pups of this stingray is believed to reduce labour pain in women if taken prior to going into labour (Alum-Udensi <em>et al.</em> 2016). The spines of this species are used to prepare arrow-heads because of the poisonous barbs and are used by local communities during fights or as collectibles (Alum-Udensi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Although not currently reported from the aquarium trade, this species appears to be a good candidate and has been collected from the wild in Nigeria to determine its survival rate in freshwater aquaria (Alum-Udensi and Nlewadim 2016).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species.&#160;Although countries across the region have legislations concerning fisheries activities, fisheries taking&#160;the Smooth Stingray are generally unmanaged throughout the species’ range and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures. Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

Furthermore, there&#160;is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across most of the range of this species which are a cause for concern.<br/><br/>Overall, considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its&#160;susceptibility to fisheries as well as aggregating behaviour, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Daisy Whipray&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (32 years)&#160;due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.

Its aggregating behaviour makes it particularly susceptible to various fisheries (Gulyugin <em>et al.</em> 2006).</span><span style=""""><br/></span><span style=""""><br/></span><span style="""">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;</span>et al.&#160;<span style="""">2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats of this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Côte d'Ivoire</span><span style="""">&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016). <br/></span>","<span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Contemporary patterns of landings indicate that while this species is still landed across its range, it has become uncommon in catches across the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016). However, although larger than its regional congener the Pearl Whipray (<em>Fontitrygon margaritella</em>), it is important to note that these species are still confused and records are likely to be aggregated. This species was only recorded in Guinea during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 (Diop and Dossa 2011). Yet, in Senegal, this species is now sometimes recorded in artisanal fisheries landings along the coast (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). There, while rays are now commonly marketed, several ray species were likely to be discarded in the past due to their low commercial value but have now become utilized bycatch (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, in The Gambia, previously unused ray species have recently become commercially targeted in response to a declining shark fishery (Moore et al. 2019). Yet, during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018, this species was only recorded in small numbers (12 individuals) compared to the Pearl Whipray (thousands of individuals) (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Mauritania, it is sometimes recorded in both artisanal and industrial trawl fisheries, but it is less common than the Pearl Whipray (M. Dia, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In recent environmental DNA surveys across the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau, this species was not detected in water samples but confirmed from market surveys, although in smaller quantities than the Pearl Whipray (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). It was also recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985 to 2012 (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Cruise reports from trawl surveys in Togo indicate that this species represented 4.2% of catches with up to 16.1 kg captured in each 30 min set between 1983–1984 (Lhomme 1985). Landing site surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 indicate that this species represents 3% of ray landings (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). In Nigeria, although quantities are not available, and it is likely that the Pearl Whipray and Daisy Whipray data are aggregated, they are very commonly captured in industrial trawl fisheries as well as artisanal fisheries (A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). It has not been detected in recent surveys in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019 (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species along with other dasyatids (Brown Stingray (<em>Bathytoshia lata</em>), Marbled Stingray (<em>Dasyatis marmorata</em>), Common Stingray (<em>D. pastinaca</em>), Pearl Whipray, and Round Stingray (<em>Taeniurops grabatus</em>)) were considered common and represented 18.5% of rays captured in 2018 (99.9% mortality rate) and 26.5% in 2019 (100% mortality rate) (E. Chartrain and G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). Overall, dasyatids in trawl fisheries represented 4.6% of trawl production in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019. This species was also recorded throughout the year from the artisanal fisheries operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and represented 1% of ray landings (E. Chartrain and G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). This species was listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" trawl surveys with up to 18 individuals representing 4.77% of catches recorded in Ghana and Gabon (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Republic of the Congo, this species was the most commonly recorded ray with 1,128 records representing 4% of landings during surveys undertaken between January and December 2019, although some of these records might include the Pearl Whipray (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, landings of the Pearl Whipray and Daisy Whipray represented up to 70% of all shark and ray records over two years of landing site surveys between 2018–2019 (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). However, based on sizes of specimens landed (&gt;34 cm DW), the Daisy Whipray is likely to be the most common species recorded there. Similarly, this species represented 7% of all sharks and rays reported through a citizen science network set up in Cameroon between 2019–2020 (A. Takoukam Kamla pers. comm. 7 July 2020). In Angola, five individuals were recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There are a number of relevant datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. Since the 1970s, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker </span></span><em>et al</em><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% between 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, even though this species is still landed in several countries across its range, considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries as well as aggregating behaviour, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Daisy Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (32 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.

It is also salted-dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). Furthermore, it is sometimes used as animal feed (e.g., for chickens in Ghana; I.

Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Daisy Whipray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure, and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K.

Reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).

The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by ten-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010 - mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch (Walker&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2018).&#160;Reports indicate that along the Benue River in Nigeria, fishing effort more than doubled in the period 1986–1991 from 839 fishers in 1986 to 1,811 fishers in 1991 (Knaap 1994). This was in parallel to a reported increase in the number of longlines and traps used from 1,465 in 1986 to 10,820 in 1989 (Knaap 1994). The increasing demand for fish is driven by human population growth and movement to coastal areas which has increased settlements by local communities along river banks (Alum-Udensi&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016). For example, the population of Lokoja town in Nigeria doubled within two decades (Alum-Udensi&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016).</span></p><p>Fishers in Cameroon have attributed declines of freshwater rays species to frequent local droughts.&#160;Indeed, local droughts have been notable in the region with rates of water flows having their lowest recorded since the beginning of the century by 1980–1990 leading to drastic reductions in floodplain surfaces and the draining of some sections of the Niger River and impacting fish species&#160;(Lae&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003).&#160;</p><p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats as well as the freshwater habitat in which the Thorny Whipray has been recorded are threatened by habitat loss and degradation (</span>Knaap 1994, Abowei and Hart 2008,&#160;<span style="""">Stobutzki&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.&#160;</em><span style="""">2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.&#160;</em><span style="""">2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unregulated tourism development; pollution including unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, and hydrocarbon and heavy metals; sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007,&#160;</span>Alum-Udensi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016,&#160;<span style="""">Polidoro&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).&#160;</span>Over the last 30 years, almost all the main rivers in the region have been dammed at least in one location and have gradually become artificially engineered with the building of embankments, free-flow canals, and irrigation ditches (GCLME 2006, Dumas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). The fragmentation of these freshwater systems has led to drastic changes in river flows and abrupt modifications in the hydrological conditions along deltas and estuaries including the elimination of regular flooding in the wet season which has led to the loss of lagoons as well as sediment in catchment areas due to the entrapment of silt behind dams (Dumas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). These changes and habitat loss due to dam development have likely affected the distribution and abundance of this species and there are concerns about the number of additional proposed dams in several West African countries (e.g., 38 potential dam sites identified in Gabon) (Cutler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p>","<p>There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Thorny Whipray that can be used to calculate population reduction.&#160;Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The most recent estimates indicate that the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW (tons per kilowatts) in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch landings were&#160;3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an&#160;increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;<a style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a>. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.&#160;More specifically, in Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years 2010–2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<p><span style="""">Second, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that in recent decades there have been limited records of this species from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region. However, it is important to note that this could be due to&#160;taxonomic uncertainty and&#160;confusion with other species of dasyatids&#160;that occur in the region. Previously this species was believed to only occur in freshwater systems, but it has now also been confirmed from coastal areas. However, it was not recorded during extensive landing site surveys across&#160;the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region (Mauritania to&#160;Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) between 2004–2011 while other species of large rays were recorded (Diop&#160;and Dossa 2011).

However, research trawl survey data from several countries in the region indicate that catch rates of other large rays have shown declines of at least 90%. This can be used to infer declines in several dasyatid species given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same gear. Furthermore, the ease of access to this species' entire distribution as well as the increasingly fragmented and degraded habitat it occupies in freshwater systems is of concern. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, anecdotal accounts of local extinction of other freshwater rays in some areas, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its&#160;susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Thorny Whipray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80%&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (90 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and a decline in habitat quality.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Thorny Whipray is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic from Guinea-Bissau to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso.

It is a euryhaline species that inhabits freshwater, estuarine, and inshore marine habitats. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in subsistence, small-scale, recreational and industrial fisheries by a wide range of fishing gears, and is retained for consumption and for display in public aquaria. The Giant Freshwater Whipray is uncommon throughout its range with a population decline of at least 60% over 26 years inferred in Cambodia, with the decline reported to be greater in upstream than downstream areas. Steep declines in catches of this species and other freshwater rays in Thailand are reported from the early 1990s. The species is subject to intensive historic and current fishing pressure and intensive habitat modification and degradation across its entire known range. It has little refuge from these threats and drastic declines in fish diversity and declines in freshwater fisheries due to over-exploitation have also occurred in its range. It is suspected that the Giant Freshwater Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (24–66 years) due to inferred declines, declines in habitat quality, and levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The Giant Freshwater Whipray is a euryhaline species found in freshwater, estuarine, and inshore marine habitats (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Grant <em>et al</em>. 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). It reaches a maximum size of at least 223 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~110 cm DW and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Sen <em>et al</em>. 2020). Reproduction is viviparous, with histotrophy, with litter size of 1–2 pups, possibly up to 3 pups (Z. Hogan pers. obs. 2008), and size-at-birth of ~30 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Phomikong <em>et al</em>. 2019). Preliminary estimates of age-at-maturity is 3 years and maximum age is 12 years (Phomikong <em>et al</em>. 2019), which would result in a generation length of 7.5 years. However, these ages are not verified or validated (Phomikong <em>et al</em>. 2019), and seem low estimates for a large whipray. There is no age information for other <em>Urogymnus </em>species, although age data is available for other dasyatids, that is, the smaller Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (80 cm DW) and Brown Stingray (<em>Dasyatis lata</em>) (144 cm DW) that have generation lengths of 19.5 years and 21.5 years respectively, and for the Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) which is another large-bodied catadromous ray that has a generation length of 22 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011, Dale and Holland 2012, Kyne and Feutry 2013). Thus, a cautious estimate of generation length of 8–22 years is inferred for the Giant Freshwater Whipray.","<span style="""">  </span><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p>The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in subsistence, small-scale, recreational and industrial fisheries and is retained for consumption and for display in public aquaria. The species is subject to intensive fisheries and habitat degradation in most of its range, as it occurs in areas where human population has expanded dramatically in recent decades. It occurs in rivers that have been dammed, which may prevent migration and isolate parts of the reproductive populations, potentially reducing the genetic diversity of the species (Compagno and Cook 2005).<br/><br/>In the Sundarbans region of India and Bangladesh, this species is caught by trawl fishers operating in river environments (e.g., Sen <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Bangladesh, it is also caught as bycatch in set-bag nets and demersal gillnets, and is targeted with longlines (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). Severe habitat degradation is ongoing throughout the Sundarbans and associated rivers. This is driven by high human population density resulting in pollution (general, agricultural, chemical, sewage, and industrial), over-harvesting of fisheries resources, vegetation removal, and upstream river engineering (e.g., Barman 2007, Sen and Mandal 2019, Sievers et al. 2020), while climate change presents a mounting issue with respect to delta habitat loss (Majumder and Barman 2013).<br/><br/>In Thailand, this species is caught by fishers in the Chao Phraya and Mea Khlong River Basins. Fisheries include small-scale, industrial, harvest for aquaria, and recreational sport fishing. This species is not known to survive well in aquaria, resulting in continual frequent harvest to maintain display animals (Compagno and Cook 2005). Sportfishing may be a serious threat as anglers have the equipment necessary to catch very large individuals and sport anglers do not always release their catch. Some catch and release anglers use very invasive techniques such as gaffing and hanging for display. Environmental degradation from pollution, damming, land clearing and altered sediment flow regimes are also likely adversely affecting populations of this species throughout Thailand (Compagno and Cook 2005, Grill <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In the Mekong River, this species is caught by local fishers (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). The Lower Mekong River supports the largest inland fishery globally and over 100 gear types are used which are categorised into hand capture, wounding gear, traps, gillnet, covering gear, luring devices, illegal methods (electro-fishing etc.), and anaesthetic methods (plant poisons) (Ainsworth et al. 2021). The Mekong River has been subject to significant damming (Grill <em>et al</em>. 2019) leading to severe habitat degradation around the Mekong Delta, as sediment flow has been significantly reduced. These effects in the Lower Basin are expected to be exacerbated by climate change and raising sea levels (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2008, Ainsworth <em>et al</em>. 2021). Dams may now prevent migration of this species into many of the Mekong tributaries or upstream into northern Laos.<br/><br/>This species has only recently been widely recorded throughout Borneo, including Brunei Darussalam, suggesting that catch rates by local fishing gear is, or at least has historically been, infrequent (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Iqbal and Yustian 2016, Windusari <em>et al</em>. 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sabah, fishers catch this species along with other rays on rod and reel or longline, and retain it for consumption or sale (Manjaji-Matsumoto 2002, Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Hydroelectric and reservoir dams, habitat degradation through land clearing, and pollution throughout Malaysian Borneo have been noted as a significant threat to this species (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Across the Kalimantan range of the species, a wide range of fishing gear is used that includes nets, gillnets, trawl, fish traps, hook and line (including longline), and gillnets, while poisons and electro-fishing techniques are used despite being prohibited (Christensen 1993, Thornton 2017, Purwanto 2018, Amrullah <em>et al</em>. 2019, Muthmainnah and Rais 2020, Ainsworth <em>et al</em>. 2021). Across the West Kalimantan range of the species, habitat degradation from land clearing, agriculture, and mining pollution is present in the Kapuas River leading to increased sediment and heavy metals (Lusiana <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Central Kalimantan, very little is known of the local range of the Giant Freshwater Whipray within the Barito and Kahayan River Basins. Habitat threats include aquaculture, logging, dams and forest burning, which collectively increase sediment and nutrient loading in the river (Thornton 2017). In Mahakam River, East Kalimantan, numerous threats including logging, mining, agriculture (burning, land clearing, agrochemicals), forest fires, and pollution associated with villages and towns have resulted in habitat modification and degradation (Yule <em>et al</em>. 2010, de Jong <em>et al</em>. 2015, Ainsworth <em>et al</em>. 2021). High fishing intensity in North Kalimantan is driven by targeting of Mahseer fish (<em>Tor </em>spp.) and concern exists for poaching of fisheries resources, including in rivers in neighbouring Sarawak Sabah (Amrullah <em>et al</em>. 2019). Deforestation is also an ongoing issue in North Kalimantan, leading to degradation of river environments (Amrullah <em>et al</em>. 2019, Anau <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In Java, the Citarum River has been heavily impacted by urban and industrial development, including a reservoir dam in the middle-lower part of the river (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016, Grill <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Sumatra, Indonesia, recreational and small-scale fishers catch Giant Freshwater Whiprays, using hook and line, gillnets, casts nets, and various traps (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2018a, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2018b, V. Hasan unpubl. data 2021). Environmental threats are poorly defined, though damming, agriculture, mining, land clearing, and increased sedimentation are likely present throughout most river basins (e.g., Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laumonier <em>et al</em>. 2010, Grill <em>et al</em>. 2019). In the Musi River Basin, oil palm, rubber plantations, and densely populated regions where pressures exist from fisheries, habitat modification, and industrial pollution are a threat to this species (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2018a).<br/><span style=""""></span>","It is possible that there are subpopulations of this species as populations in Thailand and the Mekong differ genetically from those in India (Sezaki <em>et al</em>. 1999, Vidthayano <em>et al</em>. 2016), and the morphological form of the animal in Thailand is distinct from that in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra (G.P. J. Naylor pers. comm. 29 April 2021). This species is uncommon throughout its known range. In Bangladesh, fishers report large declines in abundance of large-bodied rays, likely including this species, due to overfishing and in particular, demersal trawling (A.B Haque unpubl. data 2021). Fishers reported that when fishing for large rays 10 years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals whereas recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large individuals (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Thailand, in the Mae Khlong and Bangpakong Rivers, anecdotal information from fishers suggested that in the early 1990s and 2000s, catches of this species declined from 2 to 3 individuals per day to one individual every 2–3 days (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). In central Thailand, fishers reported a dramatic decline in catches of this species from 25 to 3 individuals in one year from 1992 to 1993; that is, a decline of 88% (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). Steep declines in freshwater rays in the Thai rivers in the early 1990s led the government to attempt to reduce species loss by implementing a captive breeding program of some freshwater ray species, including this species, and the White-edge Whipray (<em>Fluvitrygon signifer</em>), Marbled Whipray (<em>F. oxyrhynchus</em>), and introduction of the Mekong Stingray (<em>Hemitrygon laosensis</em>); this breeding program was later suspended (Compagno and Cook 2005). Some of these species were suspected to have subsequently declined due to intensive fisheries for freshwater teleosts and large-scale habitat degradation from dam building and pollution from agriculture and industrial development (Compagno 2005). Fish diversity in the Chao Phraya River drastically declined due to these threats (Compagno 2005). Declines in freshwater fisheries due to over-exploitation has also been noted in the Chao Phraya and Mae Khlong Rivers. It is highly likely that the Giant Freshwater Whipray has undergone steep declines in these Thai rivers.<br/><br/>In Cambodia, fishers reported a 62% decline in catches of this species from 1980 to ~2006, with the average size and weight also declining (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the lower Cambodian Mekong, declines of 50–95% were reported, while in the upper Cambodia Mekong, declines were also noted, but not as steep at 30–50% and fishers still reportedly regularly capturing the species (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016; amended version of 2011 assessment to accommodate genus name change). Collectively, this suggests dramatic population declines of the Giant Freshwater Whipray in the Mekong River, and due to ongoing intensive fisheries pressure and severe habitat degradation and fisheries pressures, it is highly likely that declines have continued.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam, recent information has extended the known range of this species (Iqbal and Yustian 2016, Windusari <em>et al</em>. 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In the absence of time-series throughout this range extension it is difficult to determine population trend. Only a few specimens were observed during surveys in Sabah (Manjaji-Matsumoto 2002, Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016), and this species was not noted to be commonly caught by locals in either of the surveys. Whether this is due to population depletions, as observed for other species in Sabah during these surveys (e.g., sawfishes (Pristidae spp.) and river sharks (<em>Glyphis </em>spp.)), or limitations of local fishing gear and spatial survey effort is unclear. However, the species is fished in those regions and habitat degradation is also reported and ongoing and thus, it is likely the Giant Freshwater Whipray has also declined in those areas. In Java, due to the habitat degradation of the Citarum River, it is likely that population has declined.<br/><br/>Historic and current threats to this species are intensive and ongoing, and steep population declines of this species have been observed by fishers in parts of its range. The species has little refuge from fishing pressure and habitat degradation. It is suspected that the Giant Freshwater Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (24–66 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality.",Decreasing,"<p></p>The Giant Freshwater Whipray is endemic to Southeast Asia where it has a patchy distribution (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). In India, it occurs in the Ganges River (Ishihara <em>et al</em>. 1998) and has recently been observed in east Indian fish markets, reportedly captured by trawl fishers in the Hooghly River (Sen <em>et al</em>. 2020). It also occurs in the Mahandi and Kandala Rivers, Cuttack, Odisha State, India (Fishwatcher 2001, OMMCOM NEWS 2010; K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 29 April 2021). In Bangladesh, it has been reported from the Sundarbans region and east and central coastal waters extending to Myanmar (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). Anecdotal information suggest that it also occurs upstream of coastal rivers in Bangladesh (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). In Myanmar, it has been reported in brackish waters of the Kaladan and Mayu Rivers in the Rakhine State (M. Mizrahi unpubl. data 2021) and possibly occurs within the Irrawaddy River Basin (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016, G.M. Masam Billah pers. comm. 12 January 2021), however, all of these reports require further investigation.<br/><br/>In Thailand, it occurs in the Chao Phraya, Nan, Mae Khlong, Bangpakong (Bang Pakong), Tachin and Tapi (Tapee) Rivers (Vidthayano et al. 2016). It also occurs in the Mekong River Basin in Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Laos. It possibly occurs as far upstream on the Mekong as Chiang Khong in northern Thailand, where unidentified stingrays have been seen (Z. Hogan pers. comm. in Vidthayanon et al. 2016). In Malaysia, it is known from the Sembrong River on Peninsular Malaysia (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 30 April 2021). In Malaysia Borneo, it occurs in most of the rivers and adjoining coastline across Sabah and Sarawak (Fyler and Caira 2006, Yano et al. 2005, Manjaji-Matsumoto et al. 2016, Windusari et al. 2019) and it also occurs in Brunei Darussalam (Windusari et al. 2019).<br/><br/>In Kalimantan, Indonesia, it occurs throughout riverine and coastal habitats. In North Kalimantan, it has been reported in the Tarakan delta region, Berau River, and Talisayan River (Last et al. 2010, Iqbal et al. 2020). In East Kalimantan, it is known from the Mahakam and Pasir Rivers (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In West Kalimantan, it is known from the Kapuas River and surrounding coastline (Monkolprasit and Roberts 1990, C. Leh pers. comm. in Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Central Kalimantan, there are three records from coastal regions of the Barito and Sampit Rivers, suggesting that it likely occurs within rivers along Borneo’s southern coastline (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sumatra, Indonesia, it occurs in the Indragiri, Batanghari, Musi, and Kampar River Basins, as well as along the adjoining coastline of these systems (Iqbal et al. 2020, V. Hasan unpubl. data 2021). There are also two coastal records from islands off Riau, Indonesia (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). The holotype of this species is from Java (Bleeker 1852), and since then there are two more records of this species in Java. One was collected from the Citarum River, by an aquarium trader, and another was collected from the coastal region of Palabuhanratu for Sea World Aquarium in Jakarata (Fahmi unpubl. data 2021).","The Giant Freshwater Whipray is reported from markets in India, West Bengal, Bangladesh, and possibly Myanmar, where it is sold for consumption and, at least in Bangladesh, exported (Sen <em>et al</em>. 2020, A.B. Haque and M. Mizrahi unpubl. data 2021). Skins from large rays, including this species, are exported from Bangladesh (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). In Thailand, this species is consumed and sold either fresh, smoked, or fermented (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is also targeted by sport fishing ventures (eco-tourism) in the Mae Khlong and Chao Phraya Rivers. Despite poor survival in aquaria, Giant Freshwater Whiprays are harvested for aquaria (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Indonesia, this species is often consumed fresh (Windusari <em>et al</em>. 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sarawak Malaysia, this species is likely consumed or sold at markets as noted for other rays (Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016), and in Borneo, it is used for food with the cartilage also possibly used (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). <span style=""""></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"In Indonesia, this species, along with two other freshwater ray species (White-edge Whipray and Marbled Whipray), is fully protected under the Ministry of Environment and Forestry decree No. P.20/2018 and the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries decree No. 1/2021. Implementation of species protections is, however, reportedly poor and use of destructive fishing methods such as poisons and electro-fishing is ongoing (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In Bangladesh, this species may receive some protection in the Sundarbans Protected Areas, where regulations are monitored. In Thailand, the establishment of community no-fishing reserves may offer protection to this species (Koning et al. 2020), although the distribution of the Giant Freshwater Whipray in relation to these reserves is not understood.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

107249015,245,Acipenser oxyrinchus,Near Threatened,,2006,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>A. oxyrinchus</em> occurs in the Atlantic coastal waters of Canada and the United States with spawning rivers in both countries. <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> historically ranged along the Canadian and U.S. Atlantic Coast from Labrador to Florida. Though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> occurs in most major river systems from the Mississippi River to the Suwannee River in Florida and in marine waters of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico south to Florida Bay. <br/> <br/>As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997, although Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River and in the Saint John River. The current number of mature individuals most likely numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy for this subspecies is very large (&gt;1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline). Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and re-colonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations. Throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, sturgeon breeding habitats have been adversely impacted by dams, siltation, channel maintenance (dredging) and water pollution.  Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. The subspecies is assessed as Near Threatened based on past population declines and because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery. <br/> <br/>Records for <em>A. o. desotoi</em> fisheries during the period 1887–1985 indicated that peak Florida harvest occurred in 1900–1902 (124 mt/year) followed by precipitous decline into the 1920s.  From 1923–1971 harvest was fairly stable at about 7 mt per year; declined to 2.3 mt through the 1970s; and fell further to only 0.3 mt until fisheries were closed in 1986 (Barkuloo 1988). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. With a relatively small and widely scattered population, continued habitat disturbances and contaminant threats, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> is assessed as Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>Overall, the Atlantic sturgeon <em>A. oxyrinchus</em> is considered Near Threatened based on the population declines suffered in the past and uncertainties about overall health of the population and the lengthy time required for recovery.","The Atlantic sturgeon is a large anadromous species. <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> is recorded to live for up to 60 years and reach a size of 4.3 m and 368 kg (Vladykov and Greely 1963), though most mature fish are considerably smaller. Spawning occurs in fresh or slightly brackish water when water temperatures reached 13–18˚C. Migrations into coastal tidal rivers begin as early as February in the southern portion of the range and continue through June and July in northernmost waters. In the mid-Atlantic area, Atlantic sturgeon males mature at 6–10 years and females at 10–20 years (ASMFC 1990). Maturation occurs earlier in southern waters and later in Canada. Spawning periodicity ranges from 2–6 years. Based on tagging studies ocean migrations of up to 1,450 km have been recorded (Dovel and Berggren 1983).","Atlantic sturgeon were an important item of commerce to early American and Canadian colonists and large quantities of meat, roe, oil and isinglass were exported to Europe late 17th and 18th centuries. As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. <br/> <br/>Competition, predation, diseases and parasites were evaluated in the 1998 status review by USFWS-NMFS and determined not to be limiting factors for Atlantic sturgeon stocks. Throughout the 20th century, sturgeon breeding habitats have been adversely impacted by dams, siltation, channel maintenance (dredging) and water pollution. Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. Continued application of existing U.S. laws (e.g., Clean Water Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, etc.) should result in improvements sturgeon breeding and nursery habitats. With management measures in place the current population trend for Atlantic sturgeon is increasing. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. Tissue and egg samples of Gulf sturgeon have shown elevated levels of pesticides and heavy metals. Organochlorines such as DDT and its derivatives DDD and/or DDE and toxaphene appear in most samples, sometime in concentrations exceeding U.S. Federal Drug Administration action levels for human consumption. High concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons (both from petroleum products) were detected in most Gulf sturgeon samples from numerous Florida rivers. Arsenic and mercury were detected in 92% and 87% of sturgeon samples and cadmium occurred in 42% of samples (Bateman and Brim 1994).","Atlantic sturgeon were an important item of commerce to early American and Canadian colonists and large quantities of meat, roe, oil and isinglass were exported to Europe late 17th and 18th centuries. As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. The largest fishery was in the Delaware River and Bay which by 1890 supported over 1,000 fishermen and produced 2,300 metric tons of sturgeon product. Several dozen other rivers supported sturgeon fisheries and by the late 1890s, total Atlantic Coast U.S. landings reached 3,200 mt. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. Throughout the 1970s to mid-1980s, prior to declaration of fishing moratoria, annual U.S. harvest of Atlantic sturgeon ranged from 50–100 mt with most fish being taken from the Hudson River (NY), coastal New Jersey and the Carolinas (ASMFC 1990). <br/> <br/>In 1998, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a comprehensive ""Status Review of Atlantic Sturgeon"" in response to a petition to list this species as threatened or endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The assessment found that, though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). The number of mature individuals in this range-wide population was not estimated but most likely it numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy is very large (&gt; 1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline).  Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and recolonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations.   <br/> <br/><em>A. o. desotoi</em> population estimates have been completed for the Apalachicola, Suwannee, Yellow and Choctawhatchee rivers in Florida, Pascagoula River in Mississippi, and the Pearl and Bogue Chitto rivers in Louisiana and Mississippi. The Suwannee River supports the most viable subpopulation among coastal rivers of the Gulf of Mexico and was estimated at 7,650 individuals older than age two (Sulak and Clugston 1999). The subpopulation estimate for Gulf sturgeon older than age two in the Choctawhatchee River ranges from 1,700–3,000 fish, while subpopulation estimates  in the Apalachicola, Pascagoula and Pearl rivers range from 50–350 fish (Lorio 2000). The number of mature individuals in this range wide population were not estimated but most likely number less than 10,000. Eggs and larvae of Gulf sturgeon have been collected in the Bouie, Escambia/Conecuh, Choctawatchee, Apalachicola and Suwanee rivers (Critical Habitat Ruling). <br/> <br/>Stabile <em>et al</em>. (1996) analyzed <em>A. o. desotoi</em> subpopulations from eight drainages along the Gulf of Mexico for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences among Gulf sturgeon stocks and suggested they displayed region-specific affinities and may exhibit river-specific fidelity. These authors identified five regional or river-specific stocks: (1) Lake Ponchartrain and Pearl River; (2) Pascagoula River; (3) Escambia and Yellow rivers; (4) Choctawhatchee River; and (5) Apalachicola, Ochlockonee, and Suwannee rivers.",Increasing,"<em>A. oxyrinchus</em> occurs in the Atlantic coastal waters of Canada and the United States with spawning rivers in both countries. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> historically ranged along the Canadian and U.S. Atlantic Coast from Labrador to Florida.

Though the subspecies was previously listed as also occurring in Mexico, a review of the literature fails to support that contention. A single ""sturgeon"" was reported seen (but not captured) in the Rio Grande River which separates Texas and Mexico. The Gulf sturgeon’s current area of occupancy is spread over 2,500+ river km and 1,500+ km of coastline. However, construction of dams, sills and other water control structures throughout the 20th century severely restricted inland migrations of Gulf sturgeon in many waterways from St. Andrew Bay to the Bogue Chitto River. <br/> <br/>For more information see <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer"">NatureServe’s Explorer database</a>.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997. Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River (Quebec) for subadults of <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em>, and in the Saint John River (New Brunswick) for larger fish. Also, a single fisherman is licensed on the Shubenacadie River in Nova Scotia. The St. Lawrence fishery was limited in 1997 to a quota of 6,015 fish - about 60 tons (Caron and Trembly 1997). Other regulations here include a maximum size limit of 1.5 m during a season extending from 1 May to 30 September. <br/> <br/>Peak landings on the Saint John River were 44 metric tones (mt) in 1988 but have declined in recent years to 10–14 mt. Only nine licensed fishermen remained in the St. John fishery in 1997. They were authorized to fish no more than 2,800 m of gill net with minimum mesh size of 33 cm. Minimum allowable size of sturgeon on the St. John is 120 cm and the season is closed during 1–30 June to protect spawners. Canadian authorities have expressed to U.S. authorities that these harvest levels are sustainable and do not damage the stocks (USFWS and NMFS 1998). A private aquaculture activity also occurs in New Brunswick with eggs and progeny produced from wild-caught adult sturgeon. Except for a few hundred live juveniles, most international trade in <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> in the late 1990s has been meat (2–34 mt/year) from Canada to the U.S. (CITES data). <br/> <br/>No commercial or sport fishing for Atlantic sturgeon is allowed in territorial waters of the U.S. Atlantic Coast. The management authority for this species is the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and their amendment to the 1990 Fishery Management Plan (ASMFC 1998) requires (1) no possession allowed in the 15 Atlantic states until at least 20 year-classes reach breeding age (30–40 years); (2) annual reporting of by-catch and by-catch mortality; (3) urges habitat monitoring and improvements as well as research and genetics analysis; and (4) places certain restrictions on sturgeon culture for market production and restocking.  In addition to the ASMFC action, the Secretary of Commerce has closed all U.S. Atlantic coastal EEZ waters to harvest of Atlantic sturgeon. <br/> <br/>The recent USFWS-NMFS joint status review for Atlantic sturgeon determined that listing this species as threatened or endangered under the U.S. ESA is not warranted at this time. Atlantic sturgeon are widespread and several subpopulations could be considered relatively abundant. However, because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery, USFWS has designated Atlantic sturgeon as a ""candidate species"" for possible future ESA listing and NMFS lists it as a ""species of concern"". <br/> <br/>In 1991, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> was listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Since then considerable work has been accomplished to better define life history and behavior and to determine habitats important to each life stage, population status, genetic assessment and fish culture. A recovery and management plan for Gulf sturgeon was completed in 1995 (USFWS and GSMFC 1995). This plan identifies state and federal actions necessary to rebuild populations to levels that would allow de-listing of the subspecies. In 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service officially designated ""critical habitat"" for this species, including 2,783 river kilometers and 6,042 square km of estuarine and marine habitat. <br/> <br/>With federal protection under the ESA and intensive permitting and consultation requirements for all water-related projects and discharges - especially in areas designated to be critical habitat - it is believed that <em>A. o. desotoi</em> population declines will be halted and reversed.<br/><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The loss of nest-sites through the felling of colony nest-trees is a major threat, particularly in Assam - extensive nesting colonies outside protected areas in the 1990s recorded drastic declines owing to the cutting  down of trees and drying up of some feeding sites (A. Choudhury<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2012). In many areas, drainage and conversion of wetland feeding areas, agricultural intensification, increased pesticide use and disturbance, the collection of eggs and chicks and the hunting of adults are major threats, while the spread of invasive water hyacinth <em>Eichhornia crassipes </em>may be an additional threat at least in Nepal. A recent and very serious threat, recorded in Nepal and Cambodia, is  the practice of poisoning pools to catch fish, which leads to incidental  mortality of this species <strong></strong>(Gyawali 2004, S. Browne <em>in litt</em>. 2005). Coastal populations are threatened by large-scale development, including aquaculture and the clearance of mangroves, while lowland wetlands are likely to be subject to a variety of threats including sea level rise, both directly but also through displacement of people, and conversion for plantation agriculture (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt. </em>2013). Key threats in Indonesia include the conversion of mangrove forest to fishponds and peatswamp forest to acacia plantations (M. Iqbal <em>in litt. </em>2013).

The species has an extremely large range and the overall population trend is very difficult to determine due to varying trends in different populations along different flyways. The population using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is thought to be experiencing severe declines due to habitat loss in the Yellow Sea, and the population using the East Atlantic Flyway may also be undergoing declines. Should new information arise providing clarification on the overall population trend it may warrant uplisting or downlisting.","This species breeds on slightly elevated areas in the lowlands of the high Arctic especially on southward-facing slopes, as well as along the coast and islands of the Arctic Ocean&#160;(Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). It shows a preference for open tundra with marshy, boggy depressions and pools (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Lappo <em>et al. </em>2012) from melting permafrost and snow (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;The nest is a cup positioned on the margins of marshes or pools, on the slopes of hummock tundra, or on dry patches in&#160;<em>Polygonum</em>&#160;tundra (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;In the winter the species chiefly occurs on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal mud- and sand-flats, estuaries, saltmarshes (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), exposed coral, rocky shores and tidewrack on sandy beaches (Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986), and also inland on the muddy edges of marshes, large rivers and lakes (both saline and freshwater), irrigated land, flooded areas (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996), dams (Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986) and saltpans (Khomenko 2006).&#160;On the breeding grounds the diet of this species consists mainly of insects, such as the adults, pupae and larva of Diptera (e.g. midges, craneflies (Johnsgard 1981)) and beetles, as well as bugs and leeches (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;In the winter its diet consists of polychaete worms, molluscs, crustaceans (such as amphipods, brine shrimps and copepods), and occasionally insects and seeds (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>1996). It is a full migrant, moving long distances by well-travelled routes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","The key threat in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway population is thought to be loss of stopover habitats in the Yellow Sea (see Melville <em>et al. </em>2016). In China and South Korea important migrational staging areas of this species around the coast of the Yellow Sea are being lost through land reclamation, and degraded as a result of declining river flows (from water abstraction), increased environmental pollution, unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into the area by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers (Barter 2002, Barter 2006, Kelin and Qiang 2006). These losses are thought to be driving declines in shorebird populations (Amano&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Melville <em>et al. </em>2016). It is estimated that up to 65% of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea region have been lost over the past five decades, with an annual loss of 1.2% per year since the 1980s (Murray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The species is threatened on the south-east coast of India (Point Calimere) by illegal hunting (bird trapping), reservoir and marshland habitat alteration by salt-industries, and habitat degradation by diminishing rainfall (changing the salt regime) (Balachandran 2006). It is also threatened at Walvis Bay in Namibia, a key wetland site in southern Africa, by habitat degradation (e.g. changes in the flood regime due to road building, and wetland reclamation for suburb and port development), and disturbance from tourism (Wearne and Underhill 2005). This species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet <em>et al.</em> 2007) and avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.","The global   population is estimated to number c.1,085,000-1,285,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015). The minimum European population in winter is estimated at 1,000-1,800 individuals, which equates to 690-1,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The population wintering in West Africa is estimated at 350,000-450,000 individuals (van Roomen <em>et al</em>. 2015). The East Asian-Australasian Flyway population has been estimated at 90,000 individuals (Hansen <em>et al. </em>2016).",Decreasing,"The species breeds across Arctic Siberia from the Chosa Bay to Kolyuchinskaya Gulf (north Chukotskiy Peninsula) (<strong>Russia</strong>) (Lappo <em>et al. </em>2012), and winters from sub-Saharan Africa through the Middle East and south and south-east Asia to Australasia (van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In the western Palearctic the species follows three migratory routes: down western European coasts to West Africa; across eastern Europe via the Black Sea and <strong>Tunisia</strong>&#160;to West Africa (following the coast of North Africa or via <strong>Mali</strong>); and via the Black Sea and Caspian Sea and across the Middle East and Rift Valley lakes to southern and eastern Africa (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). On return migration few birds use the western European flyway, instead moving up via Tunisia and Sivash (north Crimea). Birds that move south through Sivash winter in east, central and southern Africa and probably migrate north via the Caspian Sea. Birds also move across Siberia to <strong>India</strong>, continuing down through south-east Asia to <strong>Australia</strong> but many birds winter in southern India and <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, they may also move overland to east Asia and via the coast of <strong>China</strong> to Australia (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed on Annex II of the Bern Convention, as well as being listed as part of AEWA and CMS.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct research to better understand the species's dependence on key migratory staging sites, and increase knowledge of the impacts of disturbance (Anon. 2015).

Elsewhere in the country, marshes are threatened by reclamation and urbanisation and no freshwater swamp habitat lies within any protected area. Habitat loss and degradation is continuing at Pakxan wetland, an important stopover site in Lao, where the tall emergent grasses favoured by the species are routinely removed by local people and changes to water management for irrigation and flood control have caused the loss of some waterbodies (W. Duckworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012, 2016). &#160;In Cambodia, the situation may be more promising as the species has been recorded in man-made headponds used for dry season rice cultivation, although its preference for tall dry grass habitat may render it susceptible to dry season burning which is extensive (Bird <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. &#160;There have also been changes to the local water control regime in Cambodia with an increase in the number of small dams and a concentration of water bodies, potentially reducing the extent of suitable habitat available during the dry season.&#160;<p></p>","The global population estimate of 2,500-9,999 mature individuals is based on a detailed analysis of records by BirdLife International (2001), where it was concluded that the species must have a fairly small world population (i.e. fewer than 10,000). &#160;This estimate equates to 3,750-14,999 individuals, rounded here to 3,500-15,000 individuals. &#160;All individuals are considered to belong to a single population on the basis of the migratory nature of the species and the lack of clear division within the known breeding range of the species.",Decreasing,"<em>Acrocephalus tangorum</em> breeds in south-east <strong>Russia</strong> and north-east <strong>China,</strong> and winters in southern&#160;<strong>Laos,&#160;</strong><strong>Cambodia,&#160;</strong><strong>Thailand</strong>&#160;and Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong> (BirdLife International 2001, Kee and Bakewell 2015).&#160;It occurs as a scarce passage migrant in Hebei, Liaoning and Hong Kong in China, Pakxan wetlands in Lao (W.

Overall, the global population is estimated to be declining at such a rate that the species qualifies as Near Threatened. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is highly gregarious and migrates on a broad front, making long-distance flights often overland between relatively few staging and wintering areas<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It breeds from April to mid-June in loose, semi-colonial groups of up to 3 pairs per ha (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Non-breeding birds remain in flocks, often near to the breeding colonies. As soon as the young fledge, breeding birds begin to congregate in loose flocks which can be many thousands strong (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. The species migrates southwards between late-June and October. During the autumn migration it may roost in flocks of tens of thousands at favoured sites<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996), and this is the main moulting period for adult birds. The <em>islandica&#160;</em>subspecies moults in northwest Europe, while western populations of the nominate subspecies often moult in north Morrocco (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016), and many adults pause in north Morocco in July to moult. Huge flocks occur at some wintering sites, particularly in the floodplains of Lake Chad.&#160;The return passage occurs between February and April<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1996), and birds arrive at the breeding grounds in groups of 5-30 individuals (Johnsgard 1981)<strong></strong>. Many one-year-old birds remain in the wintering range during the summer. During the winter and migration the species usually forages gregariously<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> In its breeding range it mostly inhabits areas with high but not dense grass and soft soil<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996, Johnsgard 1981,&#160;Schekkerman and Beintema 2007, Tomkovich and Lebedeva 1998), occasionally using sandy areas; although other information suggests it may prefer short vegetation (Laursen and Hald 2012). Its preferred habitats include cattle pastures, hayfields (Johnsgard 1981), lowland wet grasslands, grassy marshland, raised bogs and moorland, lake margins and damp grassy depressions in steppes<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1996). Subspecies <em>islandica </em>shows a distinct preference for large patches of dwarf-birch bog and marsh, particularly with abundant sedge-pools<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996, Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2006). Extensive farmland habitats are of critical importance for breeding Western European populations<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996), with y<span lang=""NL"">oung, that grow up in herb-rich meadows recruiting to the breeding population 2.5 times better than young that grow up in monocultures (Kentie <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In intensively managed grasslands small shallow pools attract breeding godwits and, in combination with herb rich meadows, may improve breeding succes (Weterings <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;After the young have fledged, adults and fledglings often move to secondary habitat which more closely resembles that of their non-breeding range, including wet damp areas around fish-ponds and sewage farms, tidal marshes, mud flats and salt-water lagoons (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, Tucker and Heath 1994)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>Subspecies <em>limosa </em>tends to winter in freshwater habitats<strong></strong>, including swampy lake shores, pools, flooded grassland and irrigated rice fields<strong></strong>. Subspecies <em>islandica </em>and <em>melanuroides</em>, however,<em> </em>often winter in saline habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996) such as sheltered estuaries and lagoons with large intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), sandy beaches, salt-marshes and salt-flats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996). Despite these general differences there is considerable overlap in wintering habitat between sympatric populations of subspecies <span style=""font-style: italic;"">limosa</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">islandica</span> (Alves <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Lopes <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Seasonally-flooded grassland is a critical habitat for the birds wintering in Ireland (Hayhow 2008). Birds on passage in Iberia make much use of rice fields (Lourenço <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (especially beetles), annelid and polychaete worms, molluscs, ragworms, crustaceans, spiders, fish eggs, and the spawn and tadpoles of frogs<strong> </strong>(Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996). On the breeding grounds grasshoppers and other orthopterans are often prevalent in the diet (Johnsgard 1981). Particularly during the winter and on migration it will also take plant material including berries, seeds and rice grains<strong> </strong>(Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, Lourenço <em>et al. </em>2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. On its wintering grounds in Portugal, the bivalve <em>Scrobicularia plana</em> has been found to represent its primary food source (Moreira 1994), while&#160;in the salinas of Spain, it mainly feeds on chironomid larvae (Estrella and Masero 2010).&#160;<span lang=""NL""><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is placed on the ground in short, often luxurious vegetation<strong> </strong>(Johnsgard 1981, Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It consists of a shallow scrape 12-15cm in diameter, lined with a thick mat of stem grass, leaves and other available vegetation (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983). Breeding birds show a high degree of nest site fidelity<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996) and some degree of natal philopatry (Kruk <em>et al.</em> 1998) which is more pronounced among males (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2011). <p></p></span>","Loss of nesting habitat owing to wetland drainage and agricultural intensification, and conversely abandonment in some parts of the range, are the most significant threats (Mischenko 2008,&#160;Kentie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land and loss of habitat to development (Tucker and Heath 1994), increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland&#160;(Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), earlier and more frequent cutting as farmers adapt to climate change (Kleijn&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010), spring burning and scrub encroachment (A. Mischenko&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007)&#160;and possibly disturbance by walkers (Holm and Laursen 2009). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of egg and chick mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Kentie <em>et al. </em>2015). On intensively grazed pastures, trampling is a major cause of nest loss, and a switch to monoculture on arable land reduces the supply of insects on which the species feeds (Kentie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to silage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">A study in<span lang=""EN-US""> the central regions of <span lang=""EN-US"">European Russia suggests that<span lang=""EN-US""> <span lang=""EN-US"">significant decline in spring flood levels during two last decades, as a result climate change, has <span lang=""EN-US"">strengthened<span lang=""EN-US""> the negative impact of agricultural abandonment (<span lang=""EN-US"">A.

Indeed, sink locations have been documented for the species, where birds recruited from good quality habitat disperse to low quality habitats (often suffering high predation) effectively losing these individuals to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Leigh&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1980, Reijnen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996<strong></strong>). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)<strong></strong>.&#160;The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestion of the lowland habitats where they breed and from ongoing agricultural expansion (Gunnarsson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Gill&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007), although this population has been increasing strongly over recent decades (BirdLife International 2015).<br/>Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture, urban expansion and agricultural intensification at rice paddies. The proposed development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Masero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the European Union (EU) in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2008), which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, for example on the African wintering grounds, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact is unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species range (H. Hötker <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, although the effects of the release of some pollutants, like untreated sewage, on this species may be minor as long as there are several alternative prey present at a site (Alves <em>et al. </em>2012). In Egypt there are plans to increase the depth of the sailing channel of the Nile, impacting upon this species's habitat there (H. Ibrahim&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994) in conjunction with the extensive drainage of wetlands in this area, for energy production, water storage and agriculture (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Invasive plants may also degrade wintering habitat in Australia (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Studies of <em>islandica</em> godwits have shown that individuals breeding in the habitats where productivity is higher also winter in the areas where survival is higher (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds.&#160;<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).<strong>&#160;</strong>The population is estimated to number&#160;102,000-149,000 pairs&#160;in Europe (including 25,000 pairs in Iceland) (BirdLife International 2015); 25,000-100,000 in west-central Asia; 150,000 in central Asia and Siberia (Asian Waterbird Census unpublished data); 160,000 in the rest of Asia and Australia.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;has a large discontinuous breeding range extending from Iceland to the Russian far east, with wintering populations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Australasia<strong> </strong>(Van Gils <em>et al. </em>2017).

Subspecies<em> islandica </em>breeds predominantly in <strong>Iceland</strong>, with much smaller numbers in the <strong>Faeroe Islands</strong>, Shetland (<strong>United Kingdom</strong>) and the Lofoten Islands (<strong>Norway</strong>).

Subspecies<em> limosa </em>breeds across a wide area extending from Western Europe and central Europe to central Asia<strong> </strong>and Asiatic Russia, as far east as the River Yenisey. The west European population of this subspecies migrates south through France and Iberia to winter largely in West Africa, while eastern breeding birds winter in southeast Europe to the Middle East, and may also be the origin of wintering birds in <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Chad</strong> and northern <strong>Cameroon</strong> (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Oomen 2008, Lourenço &amp; Piersma 2008b).&#160;Subspecies<em> melanuroides </em>breeds in disjunct populations in <strong>Mongolia, </strong>northern <strong>China</strong>, Siberia (<strong>Russia</strong>) and the Russian Far East. These birds migrates across a broad front to winter from western South Asia to <strong>A</strong><strong>ustralia</strong>, encompassing&#160;<strong>India</strong>, Indochina, <strong>Taiwan, </strong>the <strong>Philippines, Indonesia, </strong>and Melanesia (Dutson 2011, Van Gils&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).<strong>&#160;</strong><br/>Population trends vary across the range. There have been large and well-documented declines in the mainland European breeding population (of the nominate subspecies) of between 50-60% (BirdLife International 2015). For example, in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>&#160;the population decreased dramatically from 120,000-135,000 pairs in 1969 and 85,000-100,000 pairs in 1989-1991, to just 46,000-62,000 in 2009 (Tucker and Heath 1994,&#160;<strong><sup> </sup></strong>BirdLife International 2004a, <strong></strong>EU Technical Report 19 2007, Oomen 2008, Höglund <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009), 35,200-59,800 pairs in 2008-2011 (BirdLife International 2015), and potentially to 33,000 pairs in 2015 (Kentie <em>et al. </em>2016). In certain areas though, the breeding population has recently stabilised as a result of agri-environmental measures (Oosterveld <em>et al. </em>2016). These declines are mirrored in the information from West African wintering areas, with notable declines in Senegal and Morocco, while further east (Mali, Chad and north Cameroon) wintering numbers appear stable, though data is sparser (Lourenço and Piersma 2008b). This is true also for the central Asian breeding population, which is thought to be stable of fluctuating (L. Belyalova<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>, but for which there is little recent data.&#160;In the eastern flyway, declines have been estimated at between 20-30% over three generations on the species Australian wintering grounds (Garnett <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010)<strong></strong>, which hold c. 50% of the wintering population of <em>L. l. melanuroides</em><strong> </strong>(Watkins 1993).&#160;The population of <em>L. l. ilsandica, </em>in contrast, has be increasing dramatically over the past few decades, although this increase may be levelling out and the subpopulation represents a relatively small part of the global population (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Wetlands International in press)<strong></strong>.&#160;A recent analysis based on published literature, survey data and expert opinions from throughout the species range suggests that, overall, the global population may have declined at a mean rate of approximately 23% over 25 years leading up to 2015 (I.

The coverage of agri-environment schemes in Europe should be increased (Kleijn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and increases in groundwater depth should be prioritised as an outcome (Verhulst <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). New nature reserves should be established on important sites throughout the species range, and there should be attempts to get greater coverage of key areas for this species within in the Special Protection Areas network (van der Vliet <em>et al. </em>2015).  Manage existing reserves appropriately: prescriptions include avoiding drainage of existing wet meadows, raising water tables where necessary, low-level use of organic fertiliser, low intensity grazing, late mowing, and prevention of succession to bushy vegetation. Winter flooding is sometimes recommended but may reduce numbers of invertebrate prey (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2005). On intensively farmed land, maintenance of unfertilised field margins has been shown to have positive effects (Oosterveld <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Investigate the potential for using a 'headstarting' approach to increase survival to fledging (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016). Prevent afforestation of lowland breeding habitat in Iceland. Prevent a loss of key breeding areas due to abandonment of grasslands and meadows in east Europe and Russian Far East. Monitor human disturbance as a threat.&#160;<br/>Ensure that migratory staging posts and winter feeding habitats and roosts are conserved and monitored, and knowledge of them is improved (Estrella and Masero 2010). Designate a special protection area at Extremadura's rice fields, which is a key stopover site (Masero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Manage artificial habitats appropriately, e.g. maintain low water levels in salinas such that they are available to foraging godwits (Estrella and Masero 2010), and block drainage to retain water in Iberian rice fields (Lourenço and Piersma 2008a). Protect important Yellow Sea tidal flats in China and South Korea. Engage with governments and local people throughout its migration routes. Effectively enforce the EU-wide ban on hunting until there is clear evidence that the population has returned to a favourable conservation status. Safeguard habitats in West Africa and Iberia, perhaps by offering support to rice producers (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Collaborate with farmers and hunters, carrying out environmental education and outreach work where appropriate.

Taken together, the Lost Shark is suspected to have undergone population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) and the remaining population size is suspected to be fewer than 50 individuals&#160;and is inferred to be continuing to decline&#160;due to actual or potential fishing levels. The weighted probability of extinction of both the threats and records and surveys models combined is 0.77–0.78 and hence the Lost Shark species is suspected to be Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct)&#160;A2d; D.</p>","<p>The habitat and depth range of the Lost Shark is unknown as it has only been collected from fish markets. Habitat can be inferred from other members of the <em>Carcharhinus porosus </em>subgroup which are generally found in coastal shelf waters, for example the Smalltail Shark (<em>C. porosus</em>) inhabits muddy inshore areas and estuaries down to a depth of 84 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann <em>et al. </em>2016). The Lost Shark is only known from a late-term embryo (34 cm total length; TL) and two juveniles (37 and 43 cm TL) (White <em>et al. </em>2019a). Maximum size was probably small around 100 cm TL (Compagno and Niem 1998). Its life history is unknown, but the Lost Shark can be inferred as having a low productivity, from its close relative the Smalltail Shark which has a litter size of 2–9 pups, a gestation length of ~1 year and a biennial reproductive cycle (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 1999, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Smalltail Shark has a low maximum population growth rate for its small body size due to its low fecundity and biennial reproductive rate with an <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.183 ± 0.13–0.24 (95% confidence interval), which is similar to Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus,</em> <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.188) and Spinner Shark (<em>C. brevipinna,</em> <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.18) (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length can be inferred from the Smalltail Shark which matures at 6 years of age and has a maximum age of 12 years, and thus it is estimated to have a generation length of 9 years (Lessa and Santana 1998, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>","<p>Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive.&#160;Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, traps, and seine nets. <br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments, and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more tripled in Sarawak from 2, 251 vessels in 1950 to 7, 650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 29/04/2020).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region&#160;</a>(Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010).<a name=""_Hlk22807790"" style="""">&#160;In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (</a><a name=""_Hlk22807790"" style="""">Heileman 2009, </a><a name=""_Hlk22807790"" style="""">Heileman and Tang 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al. </em>1995).</a></p>","<p>Intensive fisheries began more than a century ago in the South China Sea region (Butcher 1996) and it is one of the most heavily fished and poorly monitored regions in the world (Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2016, Hilborn <em>et al.</em> 2020). Consequently, most target fisheries of productive medium-sized teleost fishes were overfished by the 1960s and populations of larger sharks and rays collapsed and disappeared long before systematic catch documentation. For example, industrial trawl fisheries were introduced to the Gulf of Thailand in the 1960s and thereafter a rapid build-up of effort occurred due to initially large catches followed by the 1973 fuel crisis which forced vessels to return to their local waters in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly and Cheunpagadee 2003). This led to a rapid decline in catch per unit effort from 300 kg per hour of trawling in 1961 to 50 kg per hour in the 1980s and 20–30 kg per hour by the 1990s. By 1970, large finfish, sharks and skates had been fished down resulting in a 60% decline with the first five years of industrialised trawl fishing in the Gulf of Thailand (Myers and Worm 2003, Pauly and Cheunpagadee 2003). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. These declines are equivalent to a population reduction of 83.3% between 1960–1980 and an overall 91.7% decline over 1960–1990 for a three-generation length of 27 years. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landings data&#160;for 1998–2018&#160;are available for all combined shark species from the Gulf of Thailand (Krajangdara 2019). These showed an 86% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 9,005 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to 1,250 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003–2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort, but it suggests that the population reduction from 1960–1990 of the overall 91.7% decline is likely to have continued and be much greater than this estimate. In Viet Nam, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 were reconstructed for the<a name=""_Hlk20403173""></a> Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) based on landings data (Pauly<em><span lang=""EN-GB""> et al.</em> 2020). The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em><span lang=""EN-GB"">et al.</span></em> 2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em><span lang=""EN-GB"">et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>In Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo), reconstructed carcharhinid landings showed a 66% decline from a peak of 7,400 t in 1997 to 2,500 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s, then sharply increased in the early 1970s to over 7,000 t then decreased to 4,000–5,000 t throughout the 1980s, before increasing to the peak 1997 catch and then steeply declining in the mid-2000s. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus these declines can be used infer reductions in the populations of carcharhinids in Sarawak.<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to the suspected three generation lengths of the Lost Shark (27 years) they represent declines of &gt;91.7%, 96% and 82% in Thailand, Viet Nam, and Sarawak, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Hence, overall, the Lost Shark is suspected to have undergone population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations due to actual or potential fishing levels and meets the criteria for Critically Endangered A2d.<br/><br/>The probability of extinction can be estimated based on a Threats Model and a Records and Surveys Model (Akçakaya <em>et al. </em>2017). There are three known specimens of the Lost Shark: the holotype was a 43 cm female from Bangkok, Thailand, with no information on collection date or collector and the two paratypes were&#160;from&#160;Baram, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, collected in 1897 and from&#160;Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, collected in&#160;1934 (White <em>et al.</em> 2019a). The last known record of the Lost Shark was of the specimen collected in 1934 (White <em>et al. </em>2019a). There is extensive potential for passive surveying resulting from the daily sampling of fish assemblages through routine fishing activities, with thousands to millions of individuals processed at landing sites throughout the region on a daily basis. We conservatively estimate that the fraction of habitat passively surveyed each year is 0.15 (minimum 0.1 to maximum 0.3; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information)). <br/><br/>This species is a newly described requiem shark, which are notoriously difficult to identify except by experienced observers. Further, this species was only taxonomically described in 2019 and hence will not have appeared in historic species lists and been sought after by scientists. Hence, we assume a very low probability that this species would be recorded (<em>P(r)</em> best estimate = 0.005, minimum 0, maximum 0.01; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information). But if noted as being different enough to be recorded we assume that a scientist would be inclined to seek expert help with identification and the probability that the taxon might be identified as extant is higher (<em>P(i)</em> best estimate = 0.1, minimum 0, maximum 0.2; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>Given that this is a newly described species, we have only considered dedicated surveys by professional taxonomists that would have the experience to record the presence of a previously undocumented species but were also likely aware of the existence of the undescribed&#160;<em>Carcharhinus</em> sp. first listed in the 1970s&#160;(Compagno 1979, 1988) and subsequently known as&#160;<em>Carcharhinus&#160;</em>sp. A (Voigt&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2011, Compagno <em>et al. </em>2005a). This suggests a low to moderate likelihood of it being recorded and identified correctly (<em>P(r)</em>&#160;best estimate = 0.4, minimum 0.3, maximum 0.5; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information) consistent with a species that is moderately inconspicuous or rare and that was searched for with reasonable effort and appropriate techniques (IUCN Guidelines 2019).&#160;This suggests a high likelihood of it being correctly identified (<em>P(i)</em> best estimate = 1, minimum 1, maximum 1; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information). Similarly, extensive surveys of sharks and rays across Borneo, including in Baram, Sarawak where the Lost Shark was historically collected, failed to locate any additional records (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Extensive surveys and monitoring in areas adjacent to the historic range of the Lost Shark, including eastern Indonesia recorded &gt;21,000 sharks recorded over six years of surveys (White 2007).&#160;We assigned lower probability of recording this species outside of the known countries of occurrence, but within the South China Sea, e.g. for the Philippines survey which did not record this species&#160;(e.g. Compagno&#160;<em>et al. </em>2005b).<br/><br/>We also considered fish landing site surveys across Southeast Asia over recent decades, including in Viet Nam, Thailand, and Malaysian Borneo, that have not recorded the Lost Shark. For example, in Viet Nam,&#160;market sampling and research surveys using a combination of fishing gear (bottom trawl, gillnet, hook and line, and longline) carried out by the Research Institute for Marine Fisheries (RIMF) from 2001–2004 in the Tonkin Gulf, Southeast, and Southwest areas recorded nearly 120,000 kg of shark catch but did not record this species (SEAFDEC 2006). For this survey we assumed a significant fraction of former range was surveyed (eps best estimate = 0.3, minimum 0.2, maximum 0.4; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information), a slightly lower level of experience to record the presence of a previously undocumented species (<em>P(r)</em> best estimate = 0.3, minimum 0.2, maximum 0.4; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information) and correctly identify it (<em>P(i)</em> best estimate = 0.6, minimum 0.5, maximum 0.7; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Misidentification and misreporting through confusion with other carcharhinid sharks may have been an issue detecting this species, although there is now reasonable capacity and knowledge in the region to correctly identify sharks. The increasing use of genetic barcoding techniques, including for dried fins or other body parts, has also increased the detection of rare species. Despite this, no samples that would be attributable to this species have been detected using such barcoding techniques.<br/><br/>The Threats Model (Keith <em>et al.</em> 2017) was used to estimate a probability of extinction based on the wider understanding of the actual and potential levels of fishing resulting in inferred population reductions of &gt;91.7%, 96% and 82% in Thailand, Viet Nam and Sarawak, respectively. Intense fisheries have been developing for over a century, but industrial fisheries developed in the 1960s and have been operating for more than 6.6 generation lengths (60 years). These intense fisheries occur beyond the known range states and indeed extend throughout the broader possible range of this species throughout the South China Sea. Hence, as a result of the long duration and severity of threats in its likely range the chance of local extinction is very high <em>P(local)</em> = 0.9 (minimum 0.8 to maximum 1) and the probability that threats occurred throughout its range is certain <em>P(spatial)</em> = 1 (minimum 1 to maximum 1). As a consequence, the probability of extinction estimated from the threats model is 0.9 (minimum 0.8 to maximum 1) (See Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>The records and survey model (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2017) was used to estimate the probability of extinction as 0.47 minimum 0.36 to maximum 0.91) (See Supplementary Information). The combined probability of extinction is 0.629, however, greater weight is given to the Threats Model, which has narrower confidence intervals, and the weighted probability of extinction is between 0.77–0.78 depending on the type of weighting (0.78 from 1/range weighting and 0.77 from the 1-range weighting; see Supplementary Information). This weighted probability of extinction (0.77–0.78) is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to&#160;0.9&#160;and hence falls within the threshold of&#160;CR(PE) (Akçakaya <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>There are three lines of evidence in support of this species being extinct.&#160;First, this species in known from only three specimens and, hence, the declines were not documented.&#160;Second, severe threatening processes have occurred throughout range for a long period of time. Specifically, the Lost Shark is likely to have been fished throughout its range for the past century and particularly intensively since the 1960s more than six generations ago and is likely to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;90% in the past three generation lengths (and indeed the past three generation lengths prior).&#160;Third, there is considerable passive surveillance and there have been directed surveys that have been likely to record and identify this species. Yet, there have been no reasonably convincing or recent local reports or unconfirmed sightings since this species was first flagged as a potentially undescribed species by Leonard Compagno in the late 1970s (White <em>et al.</em> 2019a).<br/><br/>There are three lines of evidence against this species being extinct.&#160;First, this species does not have any ecological specialisation that might predispose to extinction.&#160;Second, this species is a small requiem shark and might be easily confused with or gone unnoticed among large catches or collections of other carcharhind species (White <em>et al.</em> 2019a). There are 17 species in this genus alone in Indonesia (White 2007) and the juveniles of many of the coastal requiem shark species could be easily mistaken for or mask the presence of this species in fisheries catches at landings sites.&#160;Third, the rediscovery of two ‘lost’ carcharhinid species caution that further specimens of this species might be identified in the future. The Borneo Shark (<em>Carcharhinus borneensis</em>) had not been recorded since 1937 but was rediscovered in 2004 in Sarawak Borneo (where one of the last specimens of the Lost Shark was collected) (White <em>et al.</em> 2010). Similarly, the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark (<em>Carcharhinus leiodon</em>) was previously described in 1985 from the holotype collected from Yemen in 1902, but then 25 specimens were discovered in a fish market in Kuwait in 2008 more than 3,000 km away from the last known record (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2011), with further specimens found in fish markets in Kuwait, Dubai and Abu Dhabi in UAE, and Yemen (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Taken together there are three lines of evidence in support of this species being extinct and three lines of evidence against. The decline of this species has not been well-documented and the last specimen was collected in 1934, however, the Lost Shark is suspected to have undergone population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to actual or potential fishing levels and the number of mature individuals is suspected to be less than 50. The weighted probability of extinction of both the threats and records and surveys models combined (0.77–0.78) is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to&#160;0.9 and hence falls within the threshold for CR(PE) and the species is suspected to be Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) A2d; D.</p>",Unknown,"The Lost Shark was known from the southern South China Sea (Gulf of Thailand, Viet Nam, and Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo) in the Western Central Pacific Ocean (Compagno and Niem 1998, White <em>et al. </em>2019a).","Sharks are heavily exploited and utilized in&#160;Southeast&#160;Asia for their meat, fins,&#160;and other products (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009, Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al. </em>2015).

It has been recorded from the shoreline to a depth of 10-12 m, although there is no evidence to suggest that it cannot be found in deeper areas (Te Winkel 1935). Its diet consists of 92% zooplankton and 8% phytoplankton (Soliman and Sergio 2001). It also seems to have a diurnal swimming pattern that local fishermen utilize to maximize catches (Te Winkel 1935). It breeds throughout the year with a bi-modal recruitment pattern that peaks in July and November, coinciding with periods of heavy rainfall (Soliman and Sergio 2001). It does not guard its eggs. Its eggs are planktonic and are attached to the roots of vegetation (Soliman and Sergio 2001). Despite high natural mortality, the high fecundity, and adaptation for egg protection while developing in the lake environment compensate for recruitment success and species perpetuation (Soliman 1989).","In 1975, the use of motorized pushnets in catching Sinarapan further increased potential catch sizes. By 1976, there were 34 motorized pushnets and about 490 manually operated scissor nets, all with very fine mesh nets.&#160;The motorized pushnets also destroyed aquatic vegetation used by Sinarapan for breeding, feeding, and refuge. Harvesting has also been blamed for the species disappearance from Lake Bato in the 1970s (Gindelberger 1981) and threatens the populations in Lakes Katugday and Manapao.

Conservation projects such as the Bicol Biodiversity Fish Program of Bicol University funded by the Department of Science and Technology and the Sinarapan Repopulation Initiative funded by the Ford Motors Company, Phils. have been implemented to restore its habitat and restock the populations to boost its numbers (Soliman&#160;<em style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">et al</em>. 1998), with the population in Lake Buhi thought to be making a recovery (NACA 2005). Sinarapan can be found in six lakes and lakelets in Camarines Sur where four are natural populations (Lakes Manapao, Bato, Buhi, and Katugday) and the remaining two (Lake Makuao and Lake Paguiriron) are the result of direct fish transfer strategy or translocations (Soliman&#160;<em style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">et al</em>. 1998). Some 20,000 to 40,000 Sinarapan individuals are estimated to be residing and reproducing in these lakes. There is also natural population in Lake Danao in Polangui, Albay where restocking program is in place.",Stable,"<p>This species, locally known as Sinarapan, is endemic to Bicol Region in Luzon, Philippines. It has been recorded in Lakes Buhi (Camarines Sur), Bato (Camarines Sur), and Danao (Polangui, Albay), as well as in the lakelets Manapao, Katugday, Paguiriron and Makuao (Barangay San Ramon, Buhi, Camarines Sur) in the southeast of Luzon (Soliman and Sergio 2001). It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 844 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 100 km<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>This species almost disappeared in most lakes. However, recent monitoring by the Buhi local government confirmed its presence in Lake Katugday. This can be explained by the natural transfer of Sinarapan eggs and larvae from the adjacent mountain lakes during flooding due to rains in the area. Beginning September until November, gravid female Sinarapan can be found in Lakes Paguiriron and Makuoa. Lakes Katugday and Makuao have been target lakes where the Sinarapan population has been successfully established due to direct fish transfers.  The Lake Buhi population was also thought to have crashed in the 1980s due to overfishing. There have been attempts to reintroduce this species. In 2001, it could only be found in Lakes Manapao, Buhi, and Katugday (Soliman and Sergio 2001). Sinarapan can be found now in Lakes Bato, Makuao, and Paguiriron, including Manapao, Buhi, Katugday and Danao.&#160;</p><p>Sampling in February 2020 for aging study successfully resulted in capture of genuine specimens of Sinarapan. There have been collections of alleged Sinarapan or Sinarapan-looking fish for genetic analysis but this led to multi-species genetic results. A study done in 2015 on DNA profiling has found that some specimens of supposed Sinarapan collected from Lake Buhi and Bato belonged to <em style=""background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">Leiopotherapon plumbeus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em style=""background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">Rhinogobius giurinus. </em>This indicates that reported Sinarapan sightings could potentially be misidentifications (Sanchez&#160;<em style=""background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">et al.&#160;</em>2015). A little experience is needed to identify Sinarapan from other similar-looking species. A less likely possibility is the occurrence of natural hybridization among gobiids in the lakes.&#160;</p>","This species was once the cheapest and most readily available source of protein for the majority of fisherfolks in the area. In Lake Buhi, it was commercially harvested using hand-operated scissor nets made of finely woven abaca cloth. This type of fishing gear could catch several kilograms of fish in an hour. The introduction of motorized 'sakag', a collapsible Y-shaped push net, caused yields to rise considerably but resulted to the destruction of breeding, feeding, and refuge areas of this species (Soliman and Sergio 2001).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"There are conservation measures specific for this species. Catching, gathering, or taking of Sinarapan/Tabios using motorized push nets (sarap/sacag) in Lake Buhi and Lake Bato is prohibited by Fishery Administrative Order No. 127, Series of 1980, although illegal fishing still occurs. Buhi Municipal Council passed Resolution No. 80-022, Series 1981 declaring Lakes Katugday and Manapao as 'Sinarapan' sanctuaries (Soliman and Sergio 2001). Buhi Municipal Ordinance No. 3, Series 1981 was also passed banning the fishing of Sinarapan in Lakes Katugday and Manapao. In 1998, the Buhi Sinarapan Conservation and Management Ordinance has been passed and the Sinarapan Conservation and Management Council has been organized. All mountain lakes around Mt. Asog, Buhi, Camarines Sur have been declared Sinarapan sanctuaries. Key to the successful protection of these mountain lakes is the involvement of the Aetas or aboriginal Filipinos residing along the lakeshore areas.&#160;<span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE"">There are still pending legislations for the protection and management of this species.&#160;</span><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""SpellE""><p>The local government of Buhi has employed a regular overseer, although more monitoring and regulation is needed with additional resources to effectively manage and protect the lakes (Soliman and Sergio 2001).

Now that it is extinct in much of its historic range, and some protected populations are increasing, the rate of decline may have slowed or the decline may even have stopped. However, the bulk of the past declines are believed to have occurred within the past three generations and so it is assessed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p> <p></p>","It appears to be restricted to lowland primary and/or secondary forest predominantly below 50 m, in or adjacent to riverine or coastal areas with mangroves. It breeds between January and July, and outside the breeding season it frequents both corn and rice fields. It depends on seasonally fluctuating food resources and is partially nomadic. Birds fly from the mainland to offshore islands as far as 8 km away from the mainland to roost and breed. The species is able to utilise regenerating forest for foraging and, if suitable trees are present, breeding (P. Widmann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).<br/><p></p>","On Palawan, Polillo and Samar, trapping was particularly serious, and the high price fetched per bird (c.US$160 in Manila in 1997 and US$300 in 2006) means that chicks were taken from virtually every accessible nest,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">however this trade has now virtually ceased due to the very low numbers of birds in these localities (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). High numbers were (legally) traded internationally in the 1980s (e.g. 422 in 1983). Poaching of nestlings and snares possibly intended for roosting cockatoos have also been noted during initial conservation work on Pandanan Island,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">but this threat ceased due to the implementation of an intensive wildlife warden and nest protection scheme (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). During nest monitoring on Pandanan, illegal tree cutting was also documented (Anon. 2010)<strong></strong>. Lowland deforestation and mangrove destruction have been extensive throughout its range, and have contributed significantly to its decline. It is also persecuted as a crop-pest and hunted for food. Typhoons are a threat, at least in already declining populations. Very dry breeding seasons may lead to partial or complete breeding failure, e.g. b<span lang=""EN-US"">reeding success on Pandanan and Rasa in 2016 was low and catastrophic on Dumaran (where all surviving nestlings were rescued) due to effects in El Niño<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;(P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). The release of captive birds may introduce disease into the wild population. Introduced predators represent a threat at many potential release sites. Recent attempts to establish a large-scale biofuel plantation in  cockatoo habitats on Dumaran, and a coal-fired power plant in the  immediate vicinity of Rasa Island (which held c.280 individuals in 2012), were only prevented by major advocacy campaigns and remain potential threats (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2013, Anon. 2013).&#160;Recreational activities may also play an increased role in the future, as a roost site was abandoned shortly after its location was publicised on social media (P. Widmann <em>in litt.</em> 2016).</span></span>","The population is estimated to number 650-1,120 individuals, roughly equivalent to 430-750 mature individuals (P.

In 1950, it was common throughout but a rapid decline has left a population of c. 650-1,120 birds (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). Of these, there are 580-850 on Palawan and its satellite islands, ""several hundred"" or 50-150 in Sulu (I. Sarenas <em>pers. comm. per </em>P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016), it is possibly extinct on Mindanao, and there are fewer than 20 individuals recorded in the Polillo group of islands, Bohol and Samar (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016). Subpopulations away from Palawan and the Sulus are mainly tiny and have few long-term prospects. Conservation efforts are underway at four sites; including on Rasa Island near Narra, Palawan, where the population increased from 23 in 1998 to over 200 in 2008 and 260-340 individuals by end of 2015 (Widmann and Widmann<em> </em>2008, Anon. 2010, P.

Individuals have reportedly 'self-introduced' from Rasa Island to the mainland indicating that Rasa may be reaching carrying capacity (Widmann and Widmann 2014a). Since the start of a nest protection scheme on Pandanan in 2008 the cockatoo population increased from c. 40 birds to 110 (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2012) and at least 230 by the end of 2015 (P.

It is known from five protected areas: Rasa Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Omoi and Manambaling Cockatoo Reserves in Dumaran, Culasian Managed Resource Protected Area in Rizal and Samar Island Natural Park. Since 1998 an intensive species conservation programme, the Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Program (PCCP) has been implemented by the Katala Foundation. In 2005, the Katala Foundation started to plan and build the Katala Institute for Ecology and Biodiversity Conservation, designed as a centre for environmental education and research, as well as possibly serving a role as a facility for the captive breeding of the species. Three protected areas have been specifically created for the species in Palawan on Rasa Island, Dumaran and Rizal. Conservation efforts on Rasa Island recovered a small population from 23 individuals to over 200 by July 2008 (Widmann and Widmann<em> </em>2008) and 260-340 by the end of 2015 (P. Widmann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2016)<strong></strong>. Poachers have been trained as wildlife wardens and were provided with alternative sources of income. This turned out to be the single most effective activity to prevent poaching and was repeated in three other project sites.<br/><br/>Awareness campaigns have been conducted on Mindanao, Palawan and Polillo. Trilingual conservation posters have been distributed nationwide. The Katala Pride Campaign launched on Dumaran Island has focused on raising awareness among students and farmers (Anon. 2005)<strong></strong>. In 1992, an international captive-breeding programme was initiated, with 39 birds kept under the European Studbook in 2007 (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. In 2005, drought caused the starvation of 15 chicks, so 10 chicks were hand-reared for an experimental translocation (Widmann and Widmann 2005)<strong></strong>. An extreme drought in 2010, possibly worse than that in 2005, resulted in only 15 of 25 nests on Rasa producing a total of 24 young, of which only five survived until late April and were rescued for supplementary feeding<strong></strong>. Supplemental food and water were provided for adult birds on Rasa to mitigate the effects of the drought (Anon. 2010), and this was again conducted during drought in 2016, though nestlings on Damaran were rescued to prevent starvation (P. Widmann <em>in litt. </em>2016).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Currently, sites are assessed and tested for their suitability for translocation. A first attempt on a resort island in northern Palawan indicated that rescued hand-raised birds can adapt well to natural conditions (foraging, predator avoidance), but was terminated owing to problems caused by tameness. Conservation efforts started in 2010 at a new project site on Pandanan Island to the south of Palawan (Anon. 2010)<strong></strong>, where surveys confirmed the presence of a viable population (Widmann and Lacerna-Widmann 2009)<strong></strong>.&#160;Meetings, focus groups and other events have been held to engage local communities, and alternative income sources are being promoted to reduce trapping pressure (Anon. 2010)<strong></strong>.    Experimental habitat restoration has been initiated at Dumaran and one mainland site in Palawan. A project to identify suitable reintroduction sites and to create necessary conditions for reintroduction (e.g. legal, social acceptance, site preparation) was initiated in 2012 (P. Widmann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Suitable rescued and confiscated birds from Palawan are currently released on Dumaran to supplement the existing and possibly overaged population (P. Widmann&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016); and&#160;Siargao Island, south-eastern Philippines is being made suitable for a reintroduction attempt (Anon. 2014).

The species departs its wintering grounds again from February through to May, although non-breeders may remain in the wintering areas all-year-round (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. During the winter the species usually forages singly or in small groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> occasionally aggregating into flocks of several thousand individuals, especially at roosting sites (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on upland moors, peat bogs, swampy and dry heathlands, fens, open grassy or boggy areas in forests, damp grasslands, meadows (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, non-intensive farmland in river valleys<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>, dune valleys and coastal marshlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) <em>Non-breeding</em> During the winter the species frequents muddy coasts, bays and estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> with tidal mudflats and sandflats (Snow and Perrins 1998), rocky and sandy beaches with many pools (Johnsgard 1981,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Snow and Perrins 1998), mangroves, saltmarshes (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal meadows and pasture (Johnsgard 1981, Navedo <em>et al. </em>2013) and muddy shores of coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981), inland lakes and rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It also utilises wet grassland and arable fields during migration (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists chiefly of annelid worms and terrestrial insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera and Orthoptera) (Johnsgard 1981) especially during the summer (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), although it will also take crustaceans, molluscs, polychaete worms (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, spiders (Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, berries and seeds, as well as occasionally small fish, amphibians, lizards, young birds and small rodents (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression on the ground or on a mound (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong></strong> in the open or in the cover of grass or sedge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Management information</strong> A study into the effects of shellfish harvesting by hand in coastal intertidal habitats recommends that the harvesting load should be limited to -1 during this species's autumn migration (Navedo and Masero 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","The species is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of moorland habitats as a result of afforestation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and of marginal grassland habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and improvement (Johnsgard 1981,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Baines 1988,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) (e.g. drainage, inorganic fertilisation and reseeding) (Baines 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species also suffers from high egg and chick mortalities due to agricultural practices (e.g. Tuellinghoff &amp; Bergmann 1993, Grant 1997, Fisher &amp; Walker 2015) human disturbance (Boschert and Rupp 1993) and higher predation rates if nesting on improved grasslands or in fragmented landscapes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Valkama and Korpimäki 1999, Douglas <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Conversely some populations have declined following abandonment of farmland and subsequent increases in the height of vegetation (Broyer and Roche 1991), rendering large areas unsuitable for nesting. Climate change is projected to have a large negative impact on this species during the breeding season (Huntley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Renwick <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Expansion of renewable energy projects including wind farms can also have an impact although more studies are required (Pearce-Higgins <em>et al.</em> 2009).

A range decline of 78% has been calculated in <strong>Ireland</strong> between 1968-1972 and 2007-2011 (Balmer <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Long-term declines have occurred in <strong>Norway</strong>, <strong>Sweden</strong> and <strong>Finland</strong> since the early 1980s; these declines continue except in Finland where the population stabilised between 2001-12 (BirdLife International 2015).<strong>&#160;</strong>Whilst the population appears to have fluctuated in <strong>Belarus</strong>, the population in <strong>Estonia&#160;</strong>declined by 50-70% from 1980-2012 (Elts <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, BirdLife International 2015) and long-term declines estimated at 5-30% since the 1980s have occurred in <strong>European Russia</strong>, which is estimated to support 45,000-100,000 breeding pairs (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;Long-term declines of between 18-50% since the early 1980s have also been recorded in the <strong>Netherlands</strong> and&#160;<strong>Germany </strong>(Hötker <em>et al</em>. 2007, BirdLife International 2015);&#160;Dutch declines continue but the German population has shown recent signs of stability (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;The long-term breeding population trend in <strong>France</strong> is stable but has declined by 20-25% over the period 1996-2010 (BirdLife International 2015). Declines have also been reported for the Czech Republic, Denmark (down 17% between 1999-2011, though this followed a longer-term increase), Lithuania (20-30% per decade [L. Raudonikis <em>in litt.</em> 2007]), Poland (50-60% decline between 2000 and 2013), Slovakia, and Switzerland and the European breeding population overall is estimated to be decreasing by 30-49% in 31.2 years (three generations) (BirdLife International 2015). Unquantified, but potentially highly significant, declines have also been recorded in the central Asian populations of <em>N. a. orientalis </em>(J. Kamp and S. Sklyarenko <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. In eastern Siberia (I. Fefelov <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong> breeding populations are apparently stable and apparent increases in wintering populations along the East Atlantic Flyway (van Roomen <em>et al. </em>2015), including the Wadden Sea (Laursen and Karsten 2005, Meltofte <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Laursen and Fricke 2013)<strong></strong>, as well as on the Adriatic coast (Gusson <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>, and in East Asia (M. Barter <em>in litt</em>. 2007)&#160;suggest that breeding populations, probably in European Russia and northern Siberia have perhaps increased.&#160;Other possible explanations – or contributing factors - for the discrepancy between breeding and wintering trends include data limitations (for both breeding and wintering trend data) and trends being obscured by a climate-mediated shift in wintering range (Brown 2015).<br/>Overall, analysis of the compiled trend data indicate three generation (15 year) estimate of decline of between 26% and 34%<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>Hillis 2003,&#160;BirdLife International 2004,&#160;Thorup 2006,&#160;Wetlands International 2006,&#160;A.

For this reason the species is classified as Near Threatened. <p></p>,"It inhabits a variety of deep and shallow wetlands, both man-made and natural, freshwater and saline, open and forested. It breeds colonially in <em>Acacia </em>bushes (S. Subramanya&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016, H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016), tall trees or palms and feeds in open water, primarily on fish. Some populations appear to be sedentary. With the provision of nesting towers, the species does appear to make use of these for breeding (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","A crucial factor in its decline was the loss of the Sittang valley breeding colony in Myanmar through deforestation and loss of feeding-sites. Key threats are a combination of human disturbance at breeding colonies and wetlands, extensive felling of nesting trees (such as partially submerged <em>Acacia </em>[S. Subramanya <em>in litt. </em>2016]) (see also Taher 2007), the impact of invasive plants on the species's wetland habitat, hunting (Talukdar 1996) and poaching of eggs and chicks. Additional threats include the loss of important feeding-sites through siltation, agricultural intensification, aquaculture development, building of power stations, drainage and conversion of wetlands, declines in wetland productivity as a result of pesticide use, persecution by fishermen and over-exploitation of fisheries (Talukdar 1996, Chandrasekhar 2009). There is some persecution resulting from competition between the birds and fishers. A potential but as yet unqualified threat is posed by avian influenza (P. Round <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","S. Subramanya (<em>in litt.</em> 2006) has suggested that the population in South India now exceeds 5,000 birds owing to increases resulting from improved protection of the species, and the latest figures from Andhra Pradesh and Telangara suggest that there are &gt;10,000 individuals in those states alone (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;The global population is currently placed in the range 13,000-18,000 individuals globally, roughly equivalent to 8,700-12,000 mature individuals, though this may require revising upwards in the future.",Decreasing,"<em>Pelecanus philippensis</em> was formerly common across much of Asia, but suffered a widespread decline (BirdLife International 2001). However, owing to protection and increased knowledge its estimated population has been revised upwards from a low of 5,500-10,000 birds in 2002 to an estimated 13,000-18,000 individuals in 2006. Known breeding populations are now confined to <strong>India,</strong> <strong>Sri Lanka </strong>and<strong> Cambodia</strong>, and potentially also <strong>Thailand </strong>(W. Limparungpatthanakij <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Indian population<strong> </strong>is thought to exceed 5,000 birds in the south owing to increases resulting from improved protection of the species (S. Subramanya <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, plus c.3,000 in Assam (Choudhury 2000)<strong></strong>. In southern India there are 21 known breeding colonies in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu (Subramanya 2006)<strong></strong>. One of these at Kokkare Bellur, Karnataka, has doubled in size in recent years (Subramanya 2006), and recent surveys in southern India have located more pairs than were previously estimated for the state (Gokula 2011, Anon. 2012). However, another at Uppalapadu has declined from a historical high of 12,000 individuals, with only 1,500 observed in a recent count, though a more recent estimate is 4,000 individuals (S. Subramanya <em>in litt. </em>2016). The site is however threatened by human encroachment (M. Akhtar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2008), and despite recent increases this site showed population declines in 2016 (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016). The traditional breeding site at Kolleru has become operational again, though there was a decline noted there in 2016 (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016), and with the provision of nesting towers a new breeding site has become established in the Kolleru region (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Sri Lanka, c.5,000 birds were thought to breed, possibly overlapping with the southern Indian populations (S. W. Kotagama <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2001)<strong></strong>. However, recent evidence from Sri Lanka suggests a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 pairs, with counts from the three known colonies totalling just 400 pairs (C. Kaluthota <em>in litt.</em> 2006). In South-East Asia, an estimated 1,083 nests were&#160;at Prek Toal on the Tonle Sap lake in 2014, the highest reported there ever, though 2013 had the lowest number of nest records at 803 (Visal and Mahood 2015). It probably breeds in small numbers on Sumatra, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, but probably no longer in <strong>Myanmar</strong> (G. Chunkino <em>in litt.</em> 2006, Weerakoon and Athukorala 2007). There are recent records of migrants in <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>, but it no longer occurs in the Philippines and China. Numbers recorded in Thailand have increased in recent years (P. Round <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. This is thought to be as a result of improved protection of the nesting colonies in Cambodia.

Conservation actions to reduce chick and egg collection and other forms of disturbance to the breeding colony at Prek Toal have been in place since the late 1990s. Eight out of 15 nesting sites in Tamil Nadu are protected. An awareness programme has been initiated in Sri Lanka as part of a project funded by the Conservation Leadership Programme. This has also set up research stations concerned with improving knowledge of the species (Weerakoon and Athukorala 2007).

Further proposed reclamation projects are predicted to cause additional declines in the future <p></p>,"The species breeds on open mossy or transitional bogs, moss-lichen bogs and wet meadows, and on the swampy shores of small lakes; in the non-breeding season it is essentially coastal, occurring at estuaries, mangrove swamps, saltmarshes and intertidal flats, particularly those with extensive seagrass (Zosteraceae) meadows. It often roosts in salt-marshes, behind mangroves, or on sandy beaches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).<strong>&#160;</strong>As well as tidal flats, salt-pans in the&#160;Inner Gulf of Thailand provide important roosting and feeding sites for overwintering shorebirds such as <em>N. madagascariensis</em> (Sripanomyom <em>et al.</em> 2011).<strong> </strong>Its diet on breeding grounds includes insects, such as larvae of beetles and flies, and amphipods. Berries are also consumed during the autumn migration. In non-breeding areas it feeds on marine invertebrates, preferentially taking crabs and small molluscs but also feeding on other crustaceans and polychaete worms (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). This migratory wader nests from early May to  late June, often in small colonies of 2-3 pairs, with an average clutch  size of four eggs. It probably delays maturity longer than most  shorebirds, perhaps not breeding until 3-4 years old (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Rogers <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>2006)<strong></strong>. <strong></strong><strong> <p></p></strong>","Habitat loss on the Yellow Sea staging grounds is probably the primary threat to the species, with loss of stopover sites thought to be responsible for shorebird population declines on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (Amano <em>et al</em>. 2010, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is estimated that up to 65% of intertidal habitat in the Yellow Sea has been lost over the past 50 years, with the rate of habitat loss estimated at &gt;1% every year (Murray <em>et al</em>. 2014). This scale of habitat loss is predicted to continue owing to growing populations around the Yellow Sea. It is difficult to ascertain whether declines seen at reclaimed sites such as Saemangeum represent true declines, or whether the birds have simply been displaced (Moores <em>et al. in litt.</em> 2008, D. Rogers <em>in litt. </em>2009), but the former seems more probable, given the huge scale of habitat loss in the Yellow Sea. Wetland degradation in the Yellow Sea may affect the species where it stages on migration (Bamford<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008, van de Kam <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Further threats may include disturbance at the nesting and feeding sites&#160;&#160;(Taylor &amp; Bester 1999 in Conservation Advice 2015), direct persecution throughout its range, and a decrease in the availability of food due to pollution at stopover points in South Korea. Furthermore, females probably tend to migrate further south to southern Australian wetlands which are more threatened than those in northern Australia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<p></p>","Wetlands International (2006) estimated the global population at c. 38,000 individuals, although a more recent update now estimates the population at 32,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

However, habitat destruction is probably the biggest threat currently. The breeding range of this species lies almost entirely in the Yellow Sea area where the intertidal mudflat has been reclaimed in an alarmingly fast rate (Yat-tung Yu&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;The main wintering grounds are threatened by industrial development, particularly a key site in Taiwan and also in China, and reclamation, especially in South Korea, Japan and China. Economic development in China has converted many coastal wetlands into aquaculture ponds and industrial estates. Pollution remains a major threat to birds wintering in Hong Kong.

Increases were also recorded in  South Korea, Japan and Macau. Worryingly, however, the figure from Deep  Bay (Hong Kong, and Shenzhen, China) decreased from 462 individuals in  2010 to 371 individuals this year, which represents a cumulative  decrease of nearly 20% over the period (including 40 fewer individuals  than 2015).",Increasing,"<em>Platalea minor</em> breeds on islets off the west coast of <strong>North Korea</strong> and <strong>South Korea</strong>, and offshore islets in Liaoning province in mainland NE <strong>China </strong>(Birdlife International 2001).

(in review) has highlighted the importance of water temperature (~19°C), large hollow logs in deep water, and complex littoral habitat in shallow water, for nesting Mary River cod. In terms of larval Mary River Cod, Dunlop (2016) indicated preference for woody debris and leaf litter over finer grained substrates (sand and mud) in Obi Obi and Six Mile creeks, in contrast to Tinana Creek where submerged marginal vegetation over muddy substrates were preferred.","<p>Historic threats:</p>  <p>Habitat degradation, water resource development and overfishing were identified as the major threats to Mary River Cod leading to large declines in abundance and fragmentation of remaining populations (Simpson 1994, Simpson and Jackson 2000, TSSC 2016). Extensive land clearing was attributed as a driver for exacerbated erosion and in-filling of pools. Removal of native riparian vegetation led to reduced shading of watercourses, and reduced instream wood. Overfishing and the impoundment and regulation of water resources were also listed as key threats, leading to recommendations for the protection and rehabilitation of Mary River included through prohibition of capture, protection of key habitat areas, re-stocking of juveniles, and reclamation of degraded stream habitats. The current conservation advice for Mary River Cod lists impoundment and flow regime changes, loss of riparian vegetation and instream structures, grazing and disturbance by cattle, introduced fishes and overfishing; as the major threats to the species.</p>  <p>Current threats:</p>  <p>DNRM (2016) listed contemporary threats to Mary River Cod populations including low general abundance, fragmented populations, low recruitment, habitat degradation, water regulation, low genetic diversity and a lack of information on population structure. The authors suggested ongoing research and monitoring should inform management strategies across natural resource sectors such as water use, land use and fisheries. </p>  An additional threat is the impact of technology and social media on the species. Technological advance such as smart phones with Google Earth and GPS make formerly remote areas much more accessible (e.g. forestry areas around Tinana Creek). In turn, social media forums such as Facebook are becoming increasingly popular for glorification of recreational fishing exploits, particularly with iconic and charismatic species such as Mary River Cod. This has resulted in a significant increase in targeting of Mary River Cod as demonstrated on social media and Infofish fish tagging records. From 2011 to 2013, the increase in cod tagged from the Mary system and submitted to the Infofish database was 28, 44 and 171, respectively. This included 139 fish tagged during the reported breeding season (Aug-Dec) of 2013 within a 40 km stretch of Tinana Creek alone.<br/><br/>There is a potential risk of hybridisation with other members of the genus, and/or loss of genetic diversity due to poor hatchery practices.","<p>The populations of this species are stable at present and recruitment has been observed.</p><p>Qualitative estimates of Mary River Cod sub-populations were made in Simpson and Jackson (2000) as follows: Tinana Creek (250), Six Mile Creek (250), Obi Obi Creek (70). These estimates resulted in an estimate of less than 600 individuals in the three strongholds, with insufficient data to assess the rest of the Mary catchment. Simpson and Jackson (2000) also highlighted a decline in distribution for the species compared to anecdotal evidence acquired for their study, including an absence of large cod (&gt;10 kg) and scarcity of medium cod (5-6 kg). </p>  DNRM (2016) reaffirmed the stronghold status of Tinana, Six Mile and Obi Obi creeks; identified sites re-established by Mary River Cod (Conondale and Kenilworth); identified sites not previously recorded (Traveston); and identified resident populations in the Brisbane, Logan, Albert, Stanley and Coomera catchments. Sampling conducted between 2009 and 2013 across 38 sites collected 115 individuals (DNRM 2016). 88% of sampled individuals were from the Mary River catchment, and 87% of those were from the Obi Obi and Tinana sub-catchments. Overall catch per unit effort was ~1 cod per 2 hrs of electrofishing. Sizes ranged from 115-880 mm with 52% of the population within the 400-670 mm range.

However, they are also encountered frequently several metres away from water. They climb fallen dead tree trunks or boulders jutting out from water for basking during the day. They also emerge from water to forage and to migrate to other water sources. During the height of the dry season they aestivate in the mud in tanks or sand in dried streams.<br/><br/>These soft-shell terrapins inhabit stagnant and slow flowing freshwater habitats, and in brackish waters as well as lagoons, ox-bow lakes, streams, rice fields with water, and canals in cities.

Eggs and hatchlings are also eaten by the mongoose and Common Water Monitor (<em>Varanus salvator</em>) which frequents egg laying sites. Additionally, long term effects of the wide use of chemical fertiliser, insecticides and herbicides that drain into and contaminate the water bodies where the species inhabit should be investigated, as there is an alarming increase in the rate of kidney diseases among farmers in the dry zone due to the wide use of agricultural chemicals.

The two currently recognized disjunct subspecies on Roti (<em>C. m. mccordi</em> and <em>C. m. roteensis</em>) have decreased from moderately common but restricted in the 1990s (with a total extent of occurrence (EOO) at that time of <em>ca</em>&#160;220 sq. km), to commercially and ecologically extinct at present, and now considered Possibly Extinct in the Wild, CR(PEW) A2acde+B2ab(ii,iv), based on a combination of (a) direct observation, (c) loss of habitat and area of occupancy, (d) documented exploitation, and (e) invasive predatory freshwater fish species, and on a residual area of occupancy (AOO) of &lt;10 sq. km and severely fragmented populations with continuing decline in area of occupancy and number of populations.

The species was last assessed in 2000 (when it was known only from Roti i.e. the concept excluded subspecies <em>timorensis</em>) as&#160;Critically Endangered A1d, B1+2e (version 2.3).","The habitat of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;consists of small, shallow, eutrophic inland lakes, swamps, marshlands and adjacent agricultural rice paddies and fields (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is reported to be entirely nocturnal, except during wet season rains. Reproductive ecology in the wild is largely unknown; female maturity may occur at about 10-11 years, similar to its Australian congener&#160;<em>Chelodina longicollis</em> (Kennett <em>et al</em>. 2009), giving a generation time estimate of about 15-20 years.&#160;In captivity, female maturity occurs at six years (Kayat and Saragih 2016), while a lifespan of about 30 years has been recorded from a wild specimen kept by local people on Roti (As-singkily, pers. obs.). Average clutch sizes of 12.2 (Maran and Coutard 2003) and 9.9 (Symanksi 2004) eggs have been recorded, with hatchling sizes of 23-29 mm and 25 mm carapace length,&#160;respectively. The diet of <em>C. mccordi</em> is apparently generalized carnivory or piscivory, with little dependence on hard-shelled bivalves or snails (Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Timor-Leste, <em>C. mccordi timorensis</em>&#160;aestivates under dry grass near Lake Iralalaro, exposing individuals to collection and the threat of wildfires (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Local consumption of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em> has historically been minimal. Habitat conversion of appropriate habitat into agricultural rice fields has gradually eliminated much of the species' original habitat; however, the species often utilized these altered habitats. This increased the species' chance of collection for the pet trade and exposed it to the effects of increasing use of agricultural chemicals and pesticides (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Additionally, degradation of wetlands through deforestation and climate change effects further reduce the amount of appropriate habitat for this species. Massive land conversion for agricultural activity has destroyed most of original wetlands on Roti; from 1996 to 2016 Roti has lost 70% of its freshwater area (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). A habitat rehabilitation program is needed to recover the remaining wetlands on Roti.&#160;<br/><br/>The international exotic animal trade has by far been the greatest threat impacting <em>C. mccordi</em>&#160;subpopulations. As a result of its description in 1994 as a restricted endemic species, intense pressure developed from international pet trade demand, resulting in a rapid increase in that trade (Samedi and Iskandar 2000;&#160;Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2006; Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2008). The populations were decimated within five years and the species is now considered commercially and ecologically extinct on Roti. Invasive species, including pigs, dogs, livestock and predatory freshwater fish (Snakehead and Tilapia) have also impacted populations through trampling of nests and predation on hatchlings, severely limiting recruitment even prior to the final overexploitation of adults for the live animal trade.&#160;In Timor-Leste, pollution through garbage dumping and changes to Lake Iralalaro&#160;water levels are also impacting the species (Eisemberg <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;The species is also threatened by dry season fires, as it aestivates under dry grass.","Specimens of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;were collected in large numbers from the populations on Roti from the early 1970s well into the 1990s; field surveys on Roti in 1993 revealed that the main mid-central island population was still reasonably robust but was under pressure due to collection for the international pet trade (Rhodin 1994; Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Since the mid-1990s, all known populations of <em>C. mccordi</em>&#160;on Roti appear to have suffered disastrous population declines of &gt;90% and are now commercially and ecologically extinct (Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008; Ibarrondo 2004; Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2006; As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). Despite many surveys over the last several years, the last known specimens of <em>C. m. mccordi</em> or <em>C. m. roteensis</em> on Roti Island were recorded in 2009 (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data; TCC 2018), and the species may now be locally extirpated. However, some animals have been repatriated to central Roti from captive breeding facilities (D. Gunalen, unpubl. data) and more intensive surveys and trapping efforts are needed before declaring the two Roti subspecies to be Extinct in the Wild; a few isolated individuals may still persist on the island. Interviews with local fishermen in Timor-Leste indicated that as of 2015,&#160;<em>C. m. timorensis</em>&#160;remained relatively common within its very limited range (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Chelodina mccordi mccordi </em>occurs on western Roti Island (= Pulau Rote) in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia and had an original EOO of <em>ca</em>&#160;200 sq. km, but this has now been reduced to an estimated AOO of &lt;10 sq. km, and the taxon is considered Possibly Extinct in the Wild.&#160;<em>Chelodina mccordi roteensis </em>occurs as a disjunct subpopulation on the&#160;Tapuafu Peninsula&#160;of eastern Roti Island, with an original EOO of &lt;20 sq. km, but now reduced to an estimated AOO of &lt;20 ha in two wetlands, and Possibly Extinct in the Wild.&#160;<em>Chelodina mccordi timorensis</em>&#160;occurs at Lake Iralalaro and surrounding streams in Nino Konis Santana National Park in the Lautém District of Timor-Leste and has&#160;an EOO of <em>ca</em>&#160;90 sq. km&#160;and has only one known subpopulation.","<em>Chelodina mccordi</em> on Roti has been essentially completely extirpated by massive overexploitation for the international exotic animal trade, starting first in the 1970s when it was considered to simply be an isolated population of the widespread&#160;<em>Chelodina novaeguineae, </em>which at that time was believed to occur widely as a single species across&#160;southern Indonesian Papua and Papua New Guinea, as well as northern Australia. Specimens were collected and exported from Roti since it was easy and legal to collect and export them from there rather than from the other areas of distribution, where collecting and export were either illegal or difficult. Major acceleration and focused exploitation of the Roti populations started in the mid-1990s after the description of <em>C. mccordi</em> as a new restricted endemic species (Rhodin 1994), leading eventually to its commercial and ecological extinction on Roti (Samedi and Iskandar 2000; Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008; Ibarrondo 2004; Shepherd and Ibarrondo 2005; Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2006). The presence of <em>C. mccordi timorensis</em> in Timor-Leste was not discovered and described until 2007. Interviews in Timor-Leste in 2015 indicated that it&#160;did not appear to being internationally traded there at that time (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016), but it has previously appeared in the pet trade.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;has beeen listed in CITES Appendix II&#160;since January 2005, with a zero export quota for Indonesia for specimens from the wild since June 2013. The Turtle Conservation Coalition (2011, 2018) has identified the species as one of its top conservation priorities and has twice listed it as one of the Top 25+ turtles most likely to face extinction in the near future.&#160;The Turtle Survival Alliance, European Studbook Foundation, Turtle Conservancy, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, and Nordens Ark have all targeted <em>C. mccordi</em> for <em>ex situ</em> captive breeding efforts, and various assurance colonies have been established in the US, Europe, and Singapore, with good ongoing results and successful captive breeding (Zwartepoorte 2005; Burke 2006). A new captive breeding facility is being set up in Indonesian Timor, close to Roti (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). Indonesia has legally restricted the trade of <em>C. mccordi</em> since 1997, but enforcement has been virtually non-existent; all exports of wild animals since 2002 have been illegal. However, Indonesia provides legal export permits for specimens claimed to have originated from captive breeding facilities, and one such facility operates on Java. <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;is listed as a protected species in Indonesia according to a new decree of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (no. P20/2018); it was previously listed as <em>C. novaeguineae</em> before its description as a new species. Reintroduction of this species to Roti within well-protected areas will be required if populations are to persist there; areas of suitable habitat are being considered for protected area status (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data), although at present there are no protected areas on Roti (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160;Further studies into the ecology and conservation biology of the species is urgently needed and development of an action plan to carry out intensive surveys for possible remnant populations and establishing repatriation protocols and protected areas. Concerted efforts are also required to enforce trade regulations,&#160;verify the genuine captive production of specimens approved for export from Indonesia,&#160;and curtail the persistent illegal export of <em>C. mccordi</em> (Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2008). Legislation in Timor-Leste needs to be developed, but the species is nominally protected there by its presence in Nino Konis Santana National Park.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

There is no species-specific trend data and a lack of species-specific time-series data.

It reaches a maximum size of 89 cm total length (TL), males mature at 55–60 cm TL and females mature at 52–58 cm TL (Gulyugin <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160;Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).&#160;Reproduction is placentotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 7 pups, </span><span style=""""><span style="""">a gestation period of four months and </span>size-at-birth&#160;~20 cm TL (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).

While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016). <br/></span>","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Barbeled Houndshark that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. Since the 1970s, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% between 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Second, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with population declines even though the Barbeled Houndshark still occurs in landings across the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, while species-specific information is not available, anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was historically very abundant but that targeted fisheries led to severe declines in quantities landed. The species is still captured as bycatch in targeted fisheries for 'tollo' generally consisting of the Common Smoothhood (<em>Mustelus mustelus</em>) and the Barbeled Houndshark. However, annual fisheries statistics from the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches collected since 2010, indicate that landings declined from 299 t in 2010 to 17 t in 2018 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). On the other hand, experimental fishing surveys indicate that catches have increased over the last decade (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004 and 2006, this species was present in 8.3% of the total catches and contributed 0.2% in weight (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). Two individuals were also recorded during research trawl surveys carried out between 2007–2010 in Mauritanian waters, representing 0.01% of occurrence (ratio of number of fishing hauls in which the species occurred) (Pascual-Alayon <em>et al</em>. 2017). Between 2004–2011, this species was recorded during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region in most countries except for The Gambia, Cape Verde, and Sierra Leone and was considered very abundant (Diop and Dossa 2011, M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). There has been no recent records of this species in landing site surveys in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). In The Gambia, two individuals were recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010–2018 (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Cape Verde, the species was recorded during Baited Remote Underwater Video Surveys undertaken between 2015–2017 with one individual sighted in 220 hours of underwater video footage (S. Pires, S. Ratao unpubl. data 2020). The species is likely caught in artisanal fisheries across the archipelago but landings quantities are not available because data are aggregated with other species such as the Common Smoothhound, Atlantic Weasel Shark (<em>Paragaleus pectoralis</em>), and the Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>). There, it is targeted for cação (dried shark meat) which has replaced imported cod from Portugal and has resulted in increased targeted shark fisheries (Seymour <em>et al</em>. 2018). It was recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985 to 2012, but data on quantities are not available (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). There have been no records of this species in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019 or in Nigeria during regular fisheries research surveys (K. Metcalfe, A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, it was not recorded in landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 despite other species of sharks with similar catchability like the Common Smoothhound being recorded (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). This species was listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" trawl surveys with up to eight individuals representing 0.06% of catches in one haul captured from Guinea to Morocco, and two individuals representing 2.97% of catches in one haul captured Nigeria in 2004 (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species represented up to 10.3% of sharks captured in 2016, 25.6% in 2017, 41.9% in 2018 and 34.7% in 2019 (with variations in catches over the years likely due to differences in the presence of onboard observers and spatial regulations in process) but these data were mostly aggregated with the Common Smoothhound while there are no records of this species from the artisanal fisheries operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). It was also not detected in the Republic of the Congo during landing site surveys from January 2019 to December 2019, despite having been reported as common in the past (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005), and in Cameroon in over two years of landing site between 2018–2020 (P. Doherty, A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). In Angola, two individuals were recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in other sharks (including the Common Smoothhound), it is suspected that the Barbeled Houndshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">",Decreasing,"The Barbeled Houndshark is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Mauritania to Angola, including the&#160;<span style="""">Cape Verde Archipelago</span>&#160;(Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Carpenter and De Angelis&#160;2016).&#160;It has not been recorded from São Tomé&#160;and&#160;Príncipe (Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007).","The&#160;Barbelled Houndshark is commercially valuable across its range where it is utilized fresh, smoked, or dried-salted for human consumption (Walker<em> et al.</em> 2005). Its skin is also used for leather.&#160;Fins are not considered valuable due to their small size but are still traded internationally (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"In Mauritania, a minimum size limit (60 cm total length) for landings of the Barbeled Houndshark has been established since 2007 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). There are no other known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across the region have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including finning bans, gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Barbeled Houndshark are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It inhabits the continental shelf from inshore to 100 m depth. It is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, and may also be caught in trawl fisheries, all of which are intense and largely unmanaged across much of its range. Although it has always been rare, records have become increasingly so over the decades since the 1950s; it is thought to be locally extinct in the Gulf of California and is overfished further south. There were nine records from all of Mexico between 1978 and 1994 and there have been none since. The situation is somewhat different in Colombia, where the species persists and is caught relatively frequently in artisanal catches. Fishing pressure is high there and it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction, although not as severe as that seen in Mexico. Overall, due to the known sensitivity of hammerhead sharks to overfishing, degradation of mangrove habitats, the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries across its range, its lack of refuge at depth, and the lack of recent records in Mexico (a large proportion of its range) despite fisheries-dependent and -independent surveys, it is inferred that the Scalloped Bonnethead has undergone a population

Scalloped Bonnethead inhabits the continental shelf from inshore to 100 m depth (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 92 cm total length (TL); female maturity is unknown but males mature at 67 cm TL; reproduction is placental viviparous, and it is suspected that females give birth to two pups per litter that are 23 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Generation length is suspected to be about 8 years, based on available data for the larger (150 cm TL) congeneric Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 7 years and a maximum recorded age of 18 years (Frazier <em>et al. </em>2014).","The Scalloped Bonnethead is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines  and gillnets, and may  also be caught in trawl fisheries. This hammerhead  is subjected to  intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across  its range, it has  no refuge at depth, and it has been depleted in  several areas. Gillnets that   often target sharks have been operating since for many decades in   the Gulf of California, Mexico, and have led to declines in   pelagic sharks and   other marine life (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004).   Unmanaged artisanal fisheries   targeting sharks  have been  operating  around <span>Mazatlán, Mexico since at least the 1960s (Kato   1965). Further south, intense artisanal fishing pressure exists   with  little  management in place, and there are commercial  longline  and   trawl fisheries off many areas of Central and  South  America. It is&#160;caught relatively frequently in artisanal catches in Colombia (Orozco-Guarín 2015,&#160;Galindo-Arana 2016).&#160;<span>Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).</span>","Records of the Scalloped Bonnethead have become increasingly rare over the decades since the 1950s in the northern part of its range; it is thought to be locally extinct in the Gulf of California <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>and is likely overfished further south (<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Pérez-Jiménez   2014,&#160;Saldaña-Ruiz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>).

124440562,169243577,Aetobatus flagellum,Endangered,A2d,2021,2020-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The&#160;Longhead Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus&#160;flagellum</em>) is a medium-sized (to 90 cm disc width) ray that occurs throughout the Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from the Arabian/Persian Gulf to Myanmar and in the waters surrounding Borneo down to the Java Sea. It is benthopelagic in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 40 m. This species likely has limited biological productivity with an inferred generation length of 7 years. The meat is consumed locally and traded internationally, and the skins from large rays are exported from Bangladesh to Myanmar to be made into accessories. Across the entire species’ entire range, there is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising. There are no species-specific population time-series, although  reconstructed landings data of all whiprays, which are caught in the same gears as this species, from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 52–91% over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Its coastal habitat has been degraded by urban development and agriculture. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in large declines. It is suspected that the Longhead Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is therefore assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>","The Longhead Eagle Ray is benthopelagic on the inner continental shelf at depths of 0–40 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 90 cm disc width (DW), males are mature by 50 cm DW, and females are mature by 75 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with<strong> </strong>probably a small litter size<strong> </strong>and size-at-birth is ~23 cm DW (White and Moore 2013, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Little else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from eagle rays with age data, the Bat Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>) and the Naru Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus narutobiei</em>) that have estimated generation lengths of 14.5 and 12 years, respectively (Martin and Cailliet 1988, Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2005). The Bat Eagle Ray and Spotted Eagle Ray are larger than the Japanese Eagle Ray (~180 cm and ~160 cm DW vs 90 cm DW) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 7 years for the Longhead Eagle Ray.  <p><br/></p><p><br/>  </p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Longhead Eagle Ray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seines (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. This species is threatened by being caught in inshore&#160;gillnets across its range while aggregating. In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).</p><p>Trawling is particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 28/07/2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive longline and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).&#160;Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical mile (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh<em>&#160;et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. In coastal waters prior to a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated of the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</span></p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m, but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial), and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as demersal set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the southwest region of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 tons per year with 170,000 tons (per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 tons from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg/hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, <strong>Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985)</strong>. Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20–25 days (NARA 2003).<span class=""tlid-translation""></span></p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (more than three generation lengths). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2006).&#160;<br/></span></p><p>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported  catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull  2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas, IUU catch of sharks was  estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher  levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>2010).</p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>2010).&#160;Marine habitats in the Arabian/Persian Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, and habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010) which is likely to impact this species.","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species.&#160;Despite the lack of species-specific trend data,  reconstructed landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. While not a whipray, the Longhead Eagle Ray is a similar size and susceptible to the same fishing gears as whiprays, thus the catch trends of whiprays are suspected to be similar to that of eagle rays. There are two lines of evidence throughout this species' distribution in Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Sabah, and Sarawak. <br/></p><p>In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 tonnes. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 tonnes, despite constant effort. This correlated to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 tonnes per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 tonnes in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 tonnes per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 tonnes per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 tonnes per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 tonnes, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (21 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 52–77%.</p><p>There are three lines of evidence throughout its distribution in Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, two catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia and central Indonesia, and&#160; research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 tonnes and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 tonnes in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 tonnes to &gt;200 tonnes per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch then decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (almost three generation lengths) (Blaber <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Longhead Eagle Rays in Indonesia is 54–91% over the past three generation lengths (21 years).</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.&#160;Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al. </em>2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires (n=200) completed by local fishers have indicated a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque, unpubl. data, 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2-5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 1995 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al</em>. 2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because, “<em>it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion</em>” resulting in many attempts to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005). This species was previously caught in the waters surrounding Sri Lanka in the early 2010s and is now considered extremely rare (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>In the Arabian Seas region, the species is reported as fairly common in the northern Gulf, but occurrences are patchy&#160;(Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). In a survey of elasmobranchs in Kuwait, this species represented 4% (in 2009) and 8.3 % (in 2011) of ray landings by number (Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The species was not recorded from landing surveys in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (Moore and Peirce 2013, R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 06/02/2017).&#160;Vossoughi &amp; Vosoughi (1999) recorded four individuals (~1% of 366 ray specimens) from off the Hormuz coast of Iran.&#160;The species&#160;is very rare in Pakistan and India (M. Khan and K. K. Bineesh pers. comm. 06/02/2017). Only one specimen was recorded from a survey of landing sites in Gujarat in 2013–2014 (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 09/02/2017). The population is suspected to have declined off Iran, Pakistan and India due to increased fishing pressure. In India and Pakistan, there is an overall decline in rays from intense fishing.&#160;For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The same study showed a similar (63%) decline in landings of the Spotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus ocellatus</em>), which is equivalent to a ~78% decline over a period of three generation lengths (45 years) of the Longhead Eagle Ray.&#160; It is suspected that similar pressure is ongoing in Gujarat (India) and Pakistan where trawler numbers are high (see Threats section). Pressure is lower in some other parts of its range (parts of the Gulf, Oman), but this species is apparently rare with similar catchability in a wide range of fishing gear to more numerous species such as the closely-related Banded Eagle Ray (<em>A. nichofii</em>).&#160;</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across most of the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Longhead Eagle Ray. Overall, it is inferred that the Longhead Eagle Ray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (21years) and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Longhead Eagle Ray has a patchy distribution in the Eastern and Western Indian Oceans and Western Central Pacific from the Arabian/Persian Gulf to Myanmar and in the waters surrounding Borneo down to the Java Sea (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","<p>The meat of the Longhead Eagle Ray is consumed locally in Indonesia and Malaysia (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is possibly landed at the markets in Singapore (there while&#160;<em>Aetobatus</em> species are landed but not identified to species level) and sold to local grocery stores (N. Clark-Shen unpubl. data 2020). They are occasionally landed throughout the Southeast Asian portion of their range and the meat is consumed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. In Bangladesh, the skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand of ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and some anecdotal information suggests in restaurants as well (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In the Gulf of Oman this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption.&#160;In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia (M. Khan pers. comm. 12/02/2017). In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh&#160;unpubl. data 2017). The skin of large rays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 15/02/2017). Ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price in India.<br/></p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place.&#160;In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) with a total area of 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs with a total area of 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).&#160;</p><p>There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 18/02/2020). The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman have banned trawling in their waters while Iran, Pakistan and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, Sri Lanka does not have commercial trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Kuwait is the only country across the range of this species with  regulations specifically banning catches of rays. The UAE, Qatar, and  Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993, and 2011,  respectively). However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries  (e.g. gillnetting). </p><p>  </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is captured in artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries and in industrial shrimp trawls throughout its range. Landings records of sharks from the Gulf of California artisanal fisheries, where gillnet fishing pressure is intense, indicate a decline in Whitenose Shark landings from 600 t in 1969 to 200 t in 2014 (with fishing ongoing). Targeted  fisheries for sharks including the Whitenose Shark off Mazatlan were  in operation by the early 1960s. In Guatemala in the 1990s,  this was the second-most abundant shark in artisanal fisheries, but in 2006–2007 landings surveys, this species was encountered at lower levels, and two years of surveys from 2017–2018 only recorded two individuals. In Costa Rica, trawl surveys conducted between  2008 and 2012 failed to record the species even though it was present there in  the 1980s.

A few individuals were  recorded in Peruvian landings in the late 1990s, but it has not been  recorded since.&#160;&#160;Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific.&#160;Overall, due to the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries across its range, combined with an increasing rarity of records, limited biological productivity, and habitat degradation, the Whitenose Shark is suspected to have undergone&#160;a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations (27 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","The Whitenose Shark inhabits estuaries and continental shelf waters to 192 m depth, although it is typically encountered in waters 15–24 m deep (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 150 cm total length (TL). Reproduction is placental viviparous and females give birth to five pups per litter with a size-at-birth of 53 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Generation length is suspected to be about nine years, based on that of other similarly-sized requiem sharks, the Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) and the Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhinchus</em>) (Lessa and Santana 1998, Lessa<em> et al. </em>2000).&#160;<em> </em>","The Whitenose Shark is captured in artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries and in shrimp trawls. There is intense artisanal gillnet fishing in the Gulf of California that is known to have caused declines in large pelagic sharks and other marine species (Sala<em> et al.</em> 2004). There is a shrimp trawl fishery that likely interacts with this species  in the southern Gulf of California, and management  issues such as overcapacity and  declining catches have been cited in  that fishery (Foster and Vincent  2010). Artisanal gillnets are common further south in Mexico and do land this shark (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Costa Rica, it is caught by  pelagic and demersal longliners and has been recorded in the shrimp trawl fishery there (Campos 1986). Artisanal net fisheries operate across the species' Central and South American  range. This species is recorded in landings in Ecuador (Estupiñán-Montaño <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Peru, pressure on inshore shark species is high,  particularly houndsharks, but it is likely that the Whitenose Shark is also a component of landings there. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).","Landing records of Whitenose Shark&#160;from Gulf of California artisanal fisheries indicate a peak catch of about 500 t in 1969 and another smaller peak of over 300 t in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Catch was lower over the next several decades, remaining at about 100 t annually through the 1990s and early 2000s. At the end of the time-series, Whitenose Shark catches increased to around 200 t in 2014 (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). Intense artisanal gillnet  pressure in the Gulf of California has led to declines in pelagic  sharks and other marine species (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Targeted fisheries for sharks including the Whitenose Shark off Mazatlan were  already in operation in the early 1960s (Kato 1965). In the Gulf of Tehuantepec, this species made up a small portion of the catch in artisanal fisheries, but was the fourth most captured shark between 1996 and 2003 (Soriano-Velásquez <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Guatemala in the 1990s, this species was the second-most abundant shark in artisanal fisheries, representing about 12% of the catch. In 2006–2007 landings surveys these animals were encountered at lower levels with only 29 individuals reported. Two years of surveys from 2017–2018 only recorded two individuals (C. Avalos-Castillo unpubl. data 2018). In Costa Rica, 346 trawls between 2008 and 2012 failed to record the species even though it was present in the 1980s (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2016). Catches in Colombia were relatively common in the 1990s, but it has rarely been recorded since. Landings do occur in Ecuador, and a lack of management there leads to suspicion of a population reduction. A few individuals were recorded in Peruvian landings in the late 1990s, but it has not been recorded since (X. Velez-Zuazo unpubl. data 2019). Overall, due to the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries across its  range, combined with an increasing rarity of records, it is suspected  that this shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the  past three generations (27 years).",Decreasing,"The Whitenose Shark occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from Baja California, Mexico to Peru including the Gulf of California and the Galápagos Islands (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).",This shark is retained and the meat is consumed locally.

In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted elasmobranch fishing   from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is inadequate (O.   Sosa-Nishizaki unpubl. data 2019). A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. The Galápagos&#160;Archipelago is covered by the 133,000 km² Galápagos Marine Reserve which prohibits industrial fishing but allows artisanal fishing (Davos&#160;<em>et al. </em>2007). However, the enforcement of regulations is limited and illegal fishing is prevalent, particularly for sharks (Hearn&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>To conserve the population and permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which will need to include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest&#160;management, all of which will be dependent on effective enforcement.

It is demersal in inshore waters on sand and mud habitats to at least 60 m depth, and has been reported to 333 m depth in Japan. The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including trawl, gillnet, and set net, and is retained for human consumption or fish meal. It has undergone a localised population reduction of 94% over the past three generation lengths (18 years) in Ariake Bay, Japan, due to a predator control program. Elsewhere, there are no species-specific time series, although catches of skates and rays from across the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the China and South Korea EEZs indicate declines of 27–75% over the past three generation lengths (18 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for  understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historic fishing pressure was high and is still high in China, and to a lesser extent in South Korea, but has declined in Japan over the past 30 years. It is suspected that the Japanese Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (18 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","<p>The Japanese Eagle Ray is demersal inshore on sandy and muddy substrates to at least 60 m depth, and has been reported to 333 m depth in Japan (Nakabo 2013, White <em>et al. </em>2015, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 102 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~ 43 cm DW and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Nakabo 2013, Last <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 2016, A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 1–10 (average 6) pups and size-at-birth ~20 cm DW (Last<em> et al.</em> 2016, A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from eagle rays with age data, the Bat Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>) and the Spotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus ocellatus</em>) that have estimated generation lengths of 14.5 and 12 years, respectively (Martin and Cailliet 1988, Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2016). The Bat Eagle Ray and Spotted Eagle Ray are larger than the Japanese Eagle Ray (~180 cm and ~160 cm DW vs 67 cm DW) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 6 years for the Japanese Eagle Ray.<br/></p>","<p>The Japanese Eagle Ray is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set net, and longline, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). <br/></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>In Japan, this species is taken as part of a predator control program implemented in Ariake Bay in 2001 to protect shellfish. However, catch data are not available to assess the impact of the predator control program on this species (Furumitsu <em>et al. </em>2019, A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Across Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013 (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019).&#160;</p>  <p>In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al. </em>2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014). <br/></p><p>  </p><p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region. <a name=""_Hlk35497192"">In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of tidal flats since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). </a>In the East China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands (Heileman and Tang 2009).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>In Japan, this species abundance has declined by 90% in Ariake Bay over the past 15 years, where it is captured as part of a predator control program (A.

This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in catches in the East China Sea which consisted mostly of small <em>Okamejei</em> species. Catches of skates and rays in the East China Sea declined by 77% from 1955 to 1986 (Ishihara <em>et al. </em>2002). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of rays and skates in the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</a></p>    <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the South Korea and China EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk24453985""></a>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (18 years), they represent declines of 50%, 75%, and 27% in&#160;Japan, South Korea, and China, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Significant localised depletion of the Japanese Eagle Ray in Ariake Bay is evident with a population reduction of 94% over the past three generation lengths (18 years) due to the predator control program. Historical fishing pressure was high across the spatial and depth range of the Japanese Eagle Ray, and it remains high in China, and to a lesser extent South Korea, but has declined in Japan over the past 30 years. Inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the  species some refuge. Overall, the species is suspected to have undergone  a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (18  years). </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Japanese Eagle Ray is endemic to the Northwest Pacific Ocean where it occurs off Sakhalin Island, Russia, and off Japan, North and South Korea, and China (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Dyldin and Orlov 2018).

In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J.

It is demersal on the continental shelf and slope from nearshore to a depth of 320 m.<br/><br/>This species is taken as incidental catch in bottom trawl, longline, set net, and trammel net fisheries across its range. Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo</em> spp.) have low economic value and while retained in some countries (e.g., Senegal), they are discarded in others (e.g., across the Mediterranean Sea and Gabon). If released alive, post-release survival is likely to be high.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across most of the range of this species. In the Mediterranean Sea, trend analyses of standardized catch-per-unit effort estimates from trawl surveys in the upper Tyrrhenian Sea reveal an increasing population over the past three generation lengths (30 years). However, in other locations such as the Adriatic Sea, records of this species have become rare over the last two decades. In the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which comprises most of the species' range, there are a number of distant water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species within the depth limit of this species. In Mauritania, catch data from research surveys indicate a decline equivalent to a 73% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (30 years). Across the rest of this region, there are few recent records from most countries, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent studies in the area. The Ocellate Torpedo is estimated to be stable and increasing in some areas of the Mediterranean Sea. It is suspected to be declining across West Africa where historic and current fishing pressure is high, although it might have some refuge from artisanal fisheries with depth across some of its range. It is suspected that the Ocellate Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Ocellate Torpedo is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates on the continental shelf&#160;and slope from nearshore&#160;to a depth of 320 m (Gulyugin&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006). It reaches a maximum size of 60 cm total length (TL), males mature at 18 cm TL and females mature at 22 cm TL(Abdel-Aziz 1994). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous, like other torpedo rays,&#160;with litter sizes of 3–21 pups and size-at-birth of 8–10 cm TL (Serena 2005). There is no information on this species' maximum age and age-at-maturity, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Marbled Torpedo (<em>Torpedo marmorata</em>). The Marbled Torpedo has an age-at-maturity of 12 years and a maximum age of 20 years and, thus, a generation length of 16 years (Mellinger 1971). The Ocellate Torpedo has a smaller maximum size than the Marbled Torpedo  (60 cm vs 100 cm TL), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length was inferred to be 10 years for the Ocellate Torpedo.","The Ocellate Torpedo is taken as incidental catch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is discarded or retained for human consumption. Information on post-release survival is limited, but it is suspected to be high (Tsagarakis <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the Ocellate Torpedo is sometimes landed in fisheries as bycatch. This water body has been subject to extensive and intensive fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution with trawl fisheries operating over a wide bathymetric range (50–800 m) and targeting a variety of species (Lleonart and Maynou 2003, Tsikliras <em>et al</em>. 2015). Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker et al. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutiérrez et al. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats, which are part of this species range, are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., for rice and salt production) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). For example, in West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in the Mediterranean Sea (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2005). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (30 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). The trend analysis of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE ) estimates from trawl surveys (1985–2004) in the upper Tyrrhenian Sea (central region of the Mediterranean Sea) revealed an annual rate of increase of 5%, consistent with an estimated increasing population over the past three generation lengths (30 years).<br/><br/>There are a number of other relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>First, in the Mediterranean Sea, surveys indicate that the Ocellate Torpedo is generally uncommon and less abundant than the Marbled Torpedo (<em>Torpedo marmorata</em>). It was recorded in 28 of 6,336 hauls conducted during the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) programme in the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean Sea, from 1994–1999 at depths of 10-800 m (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). In similar MEDITS surveys in the western Mediterranean (Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands) from 1994–2017, 11 specimens were recorded in the Northern Alboran Sea (Ramírez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2020). MEDITS catch data was also compared from the Adriatic Sea in 1998 with that the Hvar survey in 1948 and indicated that although this species was rarely recorded in the past, it was not recorded in the 1998 trawl surveys (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). Further investigation of these datasets and additional trawl surveys in the Adriatic Sea (to 2005) indicates that only two individuals were captured in this region in 1996 and 2003 (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2013). There are no other data to indicate population size, although the lack of recent records could be an indication of decline.<br/>&#160;<br/>Second, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker et al. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch CPUE has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to infer reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This steep increase in landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 t/kW in 1981–1983 to 0.060 t/kW in 2013–2015.<br/><br/>Third, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that while there are limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, it appears to be more common than other torpedo rays occurring in the region (e.g., Rosette Torpedo (<em>Torpedo bauchotae</em>)). The pattern of retention and discarding of torpedo rays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004–2006, this species was present in 24.8% of the total catches and contributed 0.5% in weight (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). Twenty-seven individuals were also recorded during research trawl surveys carried out between 2007–2010 in Mauritanian waters, representing 0.12% of the total number of fishing hauls in which the species occurred (Pascual-Alayon <em>et al</em>. 2017). This was species has not been reported in regular monitoring of fisheries landings between 2006–2018 undertaken by the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin which could, however, indicate that it is discarded by fishers (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). However, in research trawl fishing surveys, CPUE peaked at 24.6 kg/tow in 1988 and declined to 7.2 kg/tow in 2018 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). This decrease is the equivalent of 73% population reduction over the last three generation lengths of the Ocellate Torpedo (30 years). <br/><br/>During extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004–2011, this species was recorded across all countries except Cape Verde (where it does not occur) and Sierra Leone (Diop and Dossa 2011). However, historical data from Sierra Leone indicates that this species was considered common and abundant (Litvinov 1993) and a lack of records in landings could indicate that they are discarded there. In Senegal, it was also recorded in the fisheries monitoring program by the Centre de Recherche Océographique Dakar-Thiaroye (CRODT) between 1985–1988 (Mar 2008). Cruise reports from trawl surveys in Togo indicate that 42 individuals were caught in 1984 (Lhomme 1984). It was also recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985–2012 (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). On the other hand, it has not been detected in recent surveys in of the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau; in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019; in Nigerian research surveys (although likely to be retained here despite its low economic value); in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (although often discarded here); in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019 (although if caught it would likely be directly processed for fish meal especially in industrial fisheries); and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 although fishers were able to identify torpedo rays during interviews (P. Doherty, G.H.L. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). Landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 indicate that this species represents 7% of ray landings (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). All torpedo rays there are landed for local consumption or for utilization as chicken feed. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species is still captured but discarded alive and it is also recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and is also usually discarded (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). This species was listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" surveys and represented up to 10.9% of catches and up to 30 individuals in one trawl haul in surveys between Guinea and Morocco in 2011 (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011), up to 7.2% of catches and up to 65 individuals per trawl haul, and up to 2.1% of catches and up to eight individuals per trawl haul in Gabon and Congo, in 2008 and 2010 respectively (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mehl <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160; However, it was not listed in more recent cruise reports in Angola and northern Namibia in 2012 (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2012) and in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana in 2017 (Staby <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The Ocellate Torpedo is estimated to be stable and increasing in some areas of the Mediterranean Sea although in other regions of this basin, there has been a long history of fisheries overexploitation across its range which is ongoing. It is suspected to be declining across West Africa where historic and current fishing pressure is high although it might have some refuge from artisanal fisheries with depth across some of its range. Overall, it is suspected that the Ocellate Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation.<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span>",Decreasing,"The Ocellate Torpedo is found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea (although absent from the Black Sea) and occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It has not been recorded from the Cape Verde Archipelago but is found around São Tomé&#160;and&#160;Príncipe&#160;(Afonso <em>et al.</em> 1999, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo </em>spp.) have low economic value and have generally been discarded in the Mediterranean Sea and West Africa or used for human consumption (fresh or dried and smoked) and animal feed (e.g., Diop and Dossa 2011, Tiralongo <em>et al</em>. 2018; E. Chartrain, I. Seidu and A. B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). The Ocellate Torpedo may be used for fish oil production in the future (Ayas <em>et al</em>. 2019).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across the range of the Ocellate Torpedo have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking this species are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of its range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>In West Africa, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf&#160; at depths of 15–50 m.<br/><br/>The species is likely taken as incidental catch in demersal trawl, longline, set net, and coastal trammel net fisheries across its range. Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo </em>spp.) have low economic value and while retained in some countries (e.g., Senegal), they are discarded in others (e.g., Gabon). If released alive, post-release survival is likely to be high. <br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. In addition to artisanal fisheries in coastal areas, there are frequent incursions into these waters by distant water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species within the depth limit of this species.<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where it previously occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the West African Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (48 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The West African Torpedo is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates, and found in the vicinity of estuaries, in shallow coastal waters at depths of 15–50 m (Capapé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). It reaches a maximum size of 50 cm total length (TL), males mature at 31.5 cm TL and females mature at 35 cm TL (Capapé&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous, like other torpedo rays, gestation period is 4–5 months and size-at-birth is 9.2–9.6 cm TL (Capapé&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). There is no information on this species'  age-at-maturity and maximum  age, hence, generation length is inferred based on data for the Marbled  Torpedo (<em>Torpedo marmorata</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 12  years and a maximum age of 20 years and, thus, a generation length of 16  years (Mellinger 1971). However, this should be used with caution, as  it is noted that the West African Torpedo reaches a smaller maximum size than  the Marbled Torpedo (50 cm vs 100 cm TL).","The West African Torpedo is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is discarded or retained for human consumption.

Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker et al. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020).

In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015).

In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the West African Torpedo that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Contemporary patterns of landings indicate that there have been limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region. The pattern of retention and discarding of torpedo rays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. The West African Torpedo was recorded in Senegal between 1994 and 1998 where 78 specimens were captured using gillnets and landed, indicating that fishers there retain this species (Capapé <em>et al</em>. 2001). However, it was not recorded during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 while other species of torpedo rays were recorded in Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone (Diop and Dossa 2011). It was also not recorded in the fisheries monitoring program by the Centre de Recherche Océographique Dakar-Thiaroye (CRODT) between 1985 and 1988 (Mar 2008). In The Gambia, one individual was found discarded dead on the beach during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 despite other species of rays with similar catchability being present in large quantities (Moore et al. 2019). It has also not been detected in recent surveys in Guinea-Bissau (Bijagos Archipelago), in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019, in Nigerian research surveys (although likely to be retained here despite its low economic value), in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (although often discarded here), in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019 (although if caught it would likely be directly processed for fish meal especially in industrial fisheries), and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018, although fishers were able to identify torpedo rays during interviews (P. Doherty, G.H.L. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). In Western Ghana, based on landing site surveys in 2019 and 2020, torpedo rays represented 9% of ray landings (7% were identified as the Common Torpedo Ray (<em>Torpedo torpedo</em>) while 2% were likely a mix of the West African Torpedo and the Rosette Torpedo (<em>T. bauchotae</em>)) (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). All torpedo rays there are landed for local consumption or for utilization as chicken feed. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, torpedo rays are frequently captured but discarded alive, and they are also recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and are also usually discarded (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). Despite being morphologically distinct and easy to identify, this species was not listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" surveys in 2004 (Congo, Gabon, and Angola), 2006 (Nigeria, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon, and Congo), 2007 (Angola), 2008 (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Togo, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon, and Congo), and 2010 (Gabon and Congo) (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2006, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mehl <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, other torpedo rays with similar catchability (e.g., the Marbled Torpedo Ray and the Common Torpedo Ray) were captured in up to 18.9% of trawl hauls in surveys between Guinea and Morocco (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings have increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. The average elasmobranch landings in the region were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This steep increase landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 t/kW in 1981–1983 to 0.060 t/kW in 2013–2015.<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where it previously occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the West African Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (48 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.<span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The West African Torpedo is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Senegal to Angola (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has not been recorded from the Cape Verde Archipelago or São Tomé and Príncipe (Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo </em>spp.) have low economic value and have generally been discarded in West Africa or used for human consumption (fresh or dried and smoked) and animal feed (Diop and Dossa 2011; E. Chartrain, I. Seidu and A. B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). The West African Torpedo may be used for fish oil production in the future (Ayas <em>et al</em>. 2019).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the West African Torpedo are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters and occurs from the surface to a depth of 60 m. The Roughnose Cowtail Ray has an inferred generation length of 20 years. Its meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and its skin is used for leather products. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although reconstructed landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 50–98% over the past three generation lengths (60 years). It is threatened by the extensive loss of mangroves and degradation of inshore habitats across its range. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in population declines. It is suspected that the Roughnose Cowtail Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and a decline in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.</p>","The Roughnose Cowtail Ray is demersal inshore on continental shelf and near estuaries from the surface to a depth of 30 m depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 72 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 36–39 cm DW and females mature at 50–60 cm DW (White&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016, Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Reproduction is presumably viviparous, with histotrophy and size-at-birth is ~20 cm DW (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). One pregnant female observed contained one pup (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).&#160;As there is no information on this species' maximum age and maturity, generation length was inferred as 20 years based on data for the similarly sized Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen 2007).","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Roughnose Cowtail Ray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries.&#160;In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).&#160;Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical mile (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Habitat destruction and pollution (chemical) through aquaculture (specifically conversion of mangrove habitat into shrimp farms), mining, and coastal development is a major threat to this species. This species is known to be associated with mangrove habitat in very shallow water (M. Manjaji pers. obs. 18/05/2007) and is therefore considered highly vulnerable to destruction of this habitat. Extensive areas of mangrove forest have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through conversion of land for shrimp farms (Malaysia, East Java, Sulawesi, and Sumatra), excessive logging, urban development (Malaysia) and, to a lesser extent, conversion of land to agriculture or salt pans (Java and Sulawesi) (FAO 2007). Indonesia lost about 1,300,000 hectares of mangroves from 1980–2005 (&gt;30% of mangrove area in 1980) and Malaysia lost about 110,000 hectares during the same period (&gt;16% of mangrove area in 1980) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). This represents a loss of &gt;30% of combined overall mangrove area in Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition to loss of mangrove forests, extensive habitat degradation through destructive fishing practices and pollution has also impacted this species' shallow water habitat.</p>","<p>There is no population trend estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, reconstructed landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.&#160;This species, while not a whipray, is caught in similar gears, depths, and habitats as whiprays, thus whipray landing trends can be used to infer population trends of the Roughnose Cowtail Ray. .&#160;</p><p>There are three lines of evidence throughout its distribution in  Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch  reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Roughnose Cowtail Ray (60 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 88–98%.</p><p>There are two lines of evidence throughout its distribution in Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for central Indonesia and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Secondly, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per- unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Roughnose Cowtail Ray in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 tonnes reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 tonnes since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years, or 99% when scaled to three generation lengths (60 years) (Krajangdara 2019). There is a large amount of illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010). Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Roughnose Cowtail Ray. Overall, it is suspected that the Roughnose Cowtail Ray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (60 years).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Roughnose Cowtail Ray occurs in the Western Central Pacific Ocean around Borneo, throughout Malaysia, and in parts of Indonesia and Thailand (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Last <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Krajangdara 2019, A.

There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.

Panrays have low economic value and while retained in some countries for local consumption (e.g., Senegal and Mauritania), they are discarded and not utilized in others because even though the meat is edible, they are small and are difficult to skin (e.g., The Gambia). Panrays are often landed still alive and therefore are likely to have high post-release survival.

The Chinese Fanray has an age-at-maturity of three years and a maximum age of 12 years and, thus, a generation length of 7.5 years (Kume&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). The&#160;Chinese Fanray&#160;has a smaller maximum size than the&#160;Striped&#160;Panray (50 cm vs 60 cm TL), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 9&#160;<span style="""">y</span>ears for the&#160;Striped&#160;Panray.","The Striped Panray is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is discarded or retained for human consumption. It is often landed still alive and therefore is likely to have high post-release survival (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez et al. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats of this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","Contemporary patterns of landings indicate that the Striped Panray is still relatively abundant across its range. The pattern of retention and discarding of panrays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. The Striped Panray was recorded in Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea during landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004–2011 (Diop and Dossa 2011). In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004 and 2006, this species was present in 0.2% of the total catches and contributed 5.8% in weight [recorded as <em>Zanobatus atlanticus</em>] (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). It was also considered relatively common during bottom trawl surveys undertaken in Mauritania in May and June 2005 with frequent aggregations recorded (Gulyugin <em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/><br/>In Mauritania, this species has not been reported in regular monitoring of fisheries landings between 2006–2018 undertaken by the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin which could, however, indicate that it is absent or more likely that it is discarded by artisanal fishers (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). On the other hand, in research trawl fishing surveys, catch-per-unit-effort peaked at 20.4 kg/tow in 1988 and declined to 1.39 kg/tow in 2016 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). This decrease is the equivalent to &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths of the Striped Panray (27 years). <br/><br/>In The Gambia, individuals were frequently observed in abundance during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010–2018 (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Here, whole fresh or desiccated individuals were found discarded on the ground around fishing communities. It was also recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985 to 2012 (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Cruise reports from the ""Fridtjof Nansen"" research surveys indicate that low numbers of this species (between four and six individuals per tow representing 0.59 and 1.34% of catches respectively) were caught during surveys in the Gulf of Guinea (Morocco to Guinea) in 2011 (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011). Cruise reports from trawl surveys in Togo indicate that seven individuals were recorded in 1984 (Lhomme 1984). In Ghana, the Striped Panray was recorded in demersal fishing surveys undertaken by the Japan International Cooperation Agency between 2000–2003. These trawl surveys operated at depths between 20–100 m and recorded 14 individuals in 10 tows (5.1% of tows) (Ishihara and Kimoto 2006). Approximately 10 individuals were landed per day at sites visited in Western Ghana during surveys in 2019 and 2020, representing 7% of ray landings, although these records are likely aggregated with, and undifferentiated from, the Maculate Panray (<em>Zanobatus maculatus</em>) records (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, 38 individuals have been recorded (often landed alive) over two years of landing site surveys representing 1.7% of all shark and ray records (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). It has not been detected in recent surveys in the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau (Bijagos Archipelago); in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019; in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019; and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (P. Doherty, G.H.L. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020). This lack of records could either be due to biogeographic absence or species depletion, although the latter seems unlikely given the small size of the species and the low interest in its utilization. Therefore, the real reason for this lack of records cannot be determined at this point and further monitoring is warranted. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, panrays are relatively commonly captured, and they are also infrequently recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets, but these records might also be aggregated with the Maculate Panray (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There are a number of relevant datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker et al. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly et al. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings have increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. Average elasmobranch landings in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, of the three major fishing nations, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and while population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. Although there are population reductions reported from Mauritania equivalent to &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (27 years), it is still landed in most countries across its range and considered relatively common. Considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Striped Panray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) based on time-series data and actual of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Striped Panray is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Morocco to Angola (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has not been recorded from the Cape Verde Archipelago or São Tomé and Príncipe (Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The Striped Panray is either discarded or retained as utilized bycatch across its range. In some countries, like The Gambia, it is often found discarded on the beach and not utilized&#160;because even though the meat is edible, it is small and is difficult to skin (Ishihara and Kimoto 2006, Last<em> et al. </em>2016, Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). However, in Mauritania, it is processed (salted and dried) for export to Nigeria where it is used for local consumption (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In Senegal, interviews with fishers indicate that it is always landed because the meat is in demand. It is considered tender and is consumed fresh or salted and dried and more expensive than other species of rays (e.g., <em>Fontitrygon</em> spp.) (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Striped Panray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It inhabits shallow coastal waters and estuaries from the surface to a depth of 60 m. This species is taken as incidental catch in demersal trawl, line gear, set net, and trammel net fisheries across its range, and possibly coastal industrial fisheries using trawls. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally salted-dried or dried and smoked. It is often confused with the sympatric but larger Daisy Whipray (<em>Fontitrygon margarita</em><span style="""">)&#160;and records are&#160;likely aggregated. However, it is considered one of the most abundant rays in West Africa and is still common in landings across most of its range. This is a small species&#160;and may be relatively biologically productive compared to larger rays, which would provide resilience to&#160;fishing pressure and may account for its continued high abundance in areas where it is commercially targeted. Despite this abundance, there&#160;is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across most of the range of this species which are a cause for concern. Overall, considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its&#160;susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, but that the species is still common and abundant, it is suspected that the Pearl Whipray&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 20–29%&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (15 years)&#160;due to actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d). <br/></span>","The Pearl Whipray is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates in estuaries and shallow coastal waters to 60 m depth (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, Last et al. 2016b).

However, although smaller than its congener the Daisy Whipray (<em>Fontitrygon margarita</em>), it is important to note that these species are still confused and records are likely to be aggregated. This species was only recorded in Guinea during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 (Diop and Dossa 2011). Yet, in Senegal, this species is now commonly recorded in artisanal fisheries landings along the coast (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). Here, while rays are now commonly marketed, small species were likely to be discarded in the past due to their low commercial value but have now become utilized bycatch (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, in The Gambia, this previously unused ray has recently become commercially targeted in response to a declining shark fishery (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). During landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018, this species dominated landings of rays and was intensively utilized (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Mauritania, it is commonly recorded in both artisanal and industrial trawl fisheries (M. Dia, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In recent environmental DNA surveys across the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau, this species was detected in water samples accounting for 62% of ray DNA and was confirmed from market surveys as one of the most commonly landed ray species (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). Landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 indicate that this species represents 7% of ray landings (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). In Nigeria, although quantities are not available, this species is very commonly captured in industrial trawl fisheries as well as artisanal fisheries (A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). It was not detected in 2019 landing site surveys in Côte d'Ivoire (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species along with other dasyatids (Brown Stingray (<em>Bathytoshia lata</em>), Marbled Stingray (<em>Dasyatis marmorata</em>), Common Stingray (<em>D. pastinaca</em>), Pearl Whipray, and Round Stingray (<em>Taeniurops grabatus</em>)) were considered common and represented 18.5% of rays captured in 2018 (99.9% mortality rate) and 26.5% in 2019 (100% mortality rate) (E. Chartrain and G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). Overall, dasyatids in trawl fisheries represented 4.6% of trawl production in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019. This species was also recorded throughout the year from the artisanal fisheries operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and represented 1% of ray landings (E. Chartrain and G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). In the Republic of the Congo, this species was not recorded during surveys undertaken between January and December 2019, however, records of the Daisy Whipray which represented up to 4% of landings might have included this species (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, landings of the Pearl Whipray and Daisy Whipray represented up to 70% of all shark and ray records over two years of landing site surveys between 2018–2019 (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, this species represented 31% of all sharks and rays reported through a citizen science network set up in Cameroon between 2019–2020 (A. Takoukam Kamla pers. comm. 07/07/2020). In Angola, 10 individuals were recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There are a number of relevant datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. Since the 1970s, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% between 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in overall shark, ray, and skate populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>The species is exposed to intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, has a lack of refuge at depth, is susceptible to fisheries, and there are noted declines in rays in general across its range. However, the species is still relatively abundant and common across its range. It is suspected that the Pearl Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.<br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Pearl Whipray is&#160;found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b; R.W.

While little-species specific information is available, the meat of rays is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). It is also salted-dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). Furthermore, it is sometimes used as animal feed (e.g., for chickens in Ghana; I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Pearl Whipray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 60 m. Whiprays larger than 80 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Round Whipray has an inferred generation length of 20 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and their skins are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (60 years). In Thailand, ray landings have decreased by 78% in 8 years, a significant decrease in less than one generation length. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that the Round Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","<p>The Round Whipray is demersal inshore in coastal embayments and estuaries to depths of 60 m (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). It reaches a maximum size of 86 cm disc width (DW), males mature between 43–46 cm DW and females mature at 58 cm DW, and size-at-birth is 15–16 cm DW (Manjaji 2004; Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is presumably viviparous, with histotrophy, like others of this genus (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). Fecundity is thought to be one pup per litter (Manjaji 2004). Little else is known of its biology.&#160;Generation length was suspected to be 19 years based on similar species Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) which has a slightly smaller maximum size at 80 cm disc width (DW) (Jacobsen 2007).</p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Round Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006, Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, the effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al. </em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). S<span class=""tlid-translation""><span lang=""EN"">tingrays give the biggest contribution (more than 95%) to elasmobranchs caught by the danish seine (cantrang) which is operated in the Java Sea (Fahmi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).</span></p><p>The Round Whipray is not listed as a major catch component of the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters (D’Alberto <em>et al.</em> 2019), which may indicate a local extinction due to the long history of this fishery and the high catches of other similar-sized whiprays. There is also intensive gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and trawl and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).</p><p>Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nm from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al. </em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 Kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 Kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters, before a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em> et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi<em> et al.</em> 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p></p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite the constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 tonnes per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths, this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5% (60 years).</p><p>Two lines of evidence throughout its range within Indonesia can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Central Indonesia and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 tonnes to &gt;200 tonnes per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Round Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths.</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019). When scaled to three generation lengths, this decrease is equivalent to 100%.&#160;</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">There is limited species-specific landings data available from Myanmar, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of IUU fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just sharks) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places them in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species.</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Trawl surveys undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray species catch rates declined more than for shark species.&#160;Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort. Surveys on coral reefs in the southern portion of Myanmar in 2013 and 2014 recorded no shark species, and only a handful of <em>Neotrygo</em>n sp., during 143 dives (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;</span></p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Round Whipray.

Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat, but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and restaurants (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Meat is sometimes processed into fishmeal / animal feed when excess is landed.&#160;<p></p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987).

There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where t<span class=""tlid-translation""><span lang=""EN"">he Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing operations (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).

In Malaysia, there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al. </em>2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

The Blackspotted Whipray has a smaller maximum  size (80 cm DW) than the Tubemouth Whipray (100 cm DW), therefore  generation length was scaled to be 25 years rather than 20 years.</p><p></p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Tubemouth Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al. </em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).</p><p>Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. Data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al. </em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort. This correlated to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5%.</p><p>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Eastern Indonesia, Central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’). Finally, research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean, however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber <em>et al. </em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Tubemouth Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 tonnes reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 tonnes since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Tubemouth Whipray. Overall, it is inferred that the Tubemouth Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (75 years).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Tubemouth Whipray occurs in the Western Central Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of Thailand to Borneo (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Krajangdara 2019).","<p>The flesh of the Tubemouth Whipray is used fresh or salted and dried for human consumption throughout its range (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Its meat is preferred for local consumption and it is mainly sold fresh (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). The skin is dried and used for wallets, belts, and other high value leather products (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or 'baby' trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored.</p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 60 m.<br/><br/>The species is likely taken as incidental catch in bottom trawl, longline, set net and trammel net fisheries across its range. Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo</em>&#160;spp.) have low economic value and while retained in some countries (e.g., Senegal), they are discarded in others (e.g., Gabon). If released alive, post-release survival is likely to be high. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. In addition to artisanal fisheries in coastal areas, there are frequent incursions into these waters by distant water vessels using demersal trawl and longline gears to target demersal fish and shrimp species within the depth limit of this species.<br/><br/><span style="""">Overall, there are&#160;few data from most countries in the region,&#160;likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries.

It reaches a maximum size of 60 cm total length (TL) and little else is known about its life history. Reproduction is likely lecithotrophic viviparous, like other torpedo rays. There is no information on this species'  age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length is inferred based on data for the Marbled Torpedo (<em>Torpedo marmorata</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 12 years and a maximum age of 20 years and, thus, a generation length of 16 years (Mellinger 1971). However, this should be used with caution, as it is noted that the Rosette Torpedo reaches a smaller maximum size than the Marbled Torpedo (60 cm vs 100 cm TL).","The Rosette Torpedo is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is discarded or retained for human consumption. Information on post-release survival is limited, but it is suspected to be high. (Tsagarakis <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan et al. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","<p><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span></p>There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Rosette Torpedo that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Contemporary patterns of landings indicate that there have been limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region. The pattern of retention and discarding of torpedo rays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. The Rosette Torpedo was rarely recorded in The Gambia and Senegal during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 while other species of torpedo rays were recorded in Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone (Diop and Dossa 2011). It was also not recorded in the fisheries monitoring program by the Centre de Recherche Océographique Dakar-Thiaroye (CRODT) between 1985 and 1988 (Mar 2008). In The Gambia, one individual was recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 despite other species of rays with similar catchability being present in large quantities (Moore et al. 2019). The individual was found discarded dead on the beach. It has also not been detected in recent surveys in Guinea-Bissau (Bijagos Archipelago); in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019; in Nigerian research surveys (although likely to be retained there despite its low economic value); in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (although often discarded there); in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019 (although if caught it would likely be directly processed for fish meal especially in industrial fisheries); and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018, although fishers were able to identify torpedo rays during interviews (P. Doherty, G.H.L. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). However, one individual was recorded through a citizen science project working with local fishers in Cameroon (A. Takoukam pers. comm. 14 July 2020). In Western Ghana, based on landing site surveys in 2019 and 2020, torpedo rays represented 9% of ray landings (7% were identified as the Common Torpedo Ray (<em>Torpedo torpedo</em>) while 2% were likely a mix of the West African Torpedo (<em>Torpedo mackayana</em>) and the Rosette Torpedo) (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). All torpedo rays there are landed for local consumption or for utilization as chicken feed. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, torpedo rays are frequently captured but discarded alive, and they are also recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and are also usually discarded (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). Despite being morphologically distinct and easy to identify, this species was not listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" surveys in 2004 (Congo, Gabon, and Angola), 2006 (Nigeria, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon and Congo), 2007 (Angola), 2008 (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Togo, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon, and Congo), and 2010 (Gabon and Congo) (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2006, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mehl <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, other torpedo rays with similar catchability (e.g., the Marbled Torpedo Ray and the Common Torpedo Ray) were captured in up to 18.9% of trawl hauls in surveys between Guinea and Morocco (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings have increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. Average elasmobranch landings in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This steep increase landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 t/kW in 1981–1983 to 0.060 t/kW in 2013–2015.<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where it previously occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Rosette Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (48 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.<span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span>",Decreasing,"The Rosette Torpedo is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Senegal to Angola (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has not been recorded from the Cape Verde Archipelago or São Tomé and Príncipe (Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo&#160;</em>spp.) have low economic value and have generally been discarded in West Africa&#160;(E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020), or are used for human consumption (fresh or dried and smoked) and animal feed (Diop and Dossa 2011, I. Seidu and A. B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). The Rosette Torpedo&#160;may&#160;be used for fish oil production in the future (Ayas<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Rosette Torpedo are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It inhabits estuaries and the continental shelf from the surface to a depth of 30 m.<br/><br/>This species is a bycatch of artisanal net fisheries and possibly coastal industrial fisheries using trawls. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally salted-dried or dried and smoked. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species.<br/><br/>Very few records are available from across its range despite ongoing artisanal fisheries monitoring projects (although many are recent and do not cover the whole range of the species), however, confusion with other dasyatid species occurring in the region is likely. There is a lack of species-specific reporting, taxonomic and identification issues, as well as a lack of species-specific time-series data. However, research trawl survey data from several countries in the region indicate that catch rates of other large rays have shown declines of at least 90%. This can be used to infer declines in several dasyatid species given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same gear. <br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, however, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in large rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Smalltooth Stingray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (45 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.<span style=""""><br/></span>","<span style="""">The Smalltooth Stingray occurs in estuarine and shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf from the surface to&#160;a&#160;depth of&#160;30 m (</span><span style="""">Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b).

It is also likely taken in industrial fisheries operating trawls in coastal areas.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore et al. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares et al. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats of this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Smalltooth Stingray that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Second, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that in recent decades there have been limited records of this species from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region. However, it is important to note that this could be due to taxonomic uncertainty and confusion with other species of dasyatids that occur in the region. This species was not recorded during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 while other species of large rays were recorded (Diop and Dossa 2011). However, six individuals were recently recorded in opportunistic surveys in Mauritania's Parc National du Banc D'Arguin (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In The Gambia, only three individuals were recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 despite other species of rays with similar catchability being present in large quantities (Moore et al. 2019). In recent environmental DNA surveys across the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau, this species was detected in water samples and confirmed from market surveys were it was sold fresh for local consumption (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, two individuals were recorded from surveys of local markets in São Tomé and Príncipe (G. Porriños unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, three individuals were recorded over two years of landing site surveys (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). In Gabon, a handful of specimens resembling this species have been recorded in artisanal fisheries operating demersal set gillnets in Mayumba, but confirmation is required (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). However, this species has not been detected in recent surveys in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019, in Nigerian research trawl surveys, and in Western Ghana during landing site surveys in 2019 and 2020, despite other species of rays with similar catchability being recorded in significant quantities (P. Doherty, K. Metcalfe, I. Seidu, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There is a lack of species-specific reporting, taxonomic and identification issues, as well as a lack of species-specific time-series data. However, research trawl survey data from several countries in the region indicate that catch rates of other large rays have shown declines of at least 90%. This can be used to infer declines in several dasyatid species given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same gear.

It is known from a small number of fragmented records and is likely to have been historically confused with other dasyatid species occurring in the region.","The Smalltooth Stingray is utilized for its meat. While little-species specific information is available, the meat of rays is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso.",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Smalltooth Stingray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

This shark is captured as bycatch in demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and in teleost traps, and is targeted by artisanal gillnets and longlines throughout much of its range. These fisheries are generally intense in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. There is evidence of a population reduction including an increasing rarity of landings and anecdotal evidence from fishers. Gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California, Mexico, is high and has led to declines in pelagic sharks, and smaller coastal sharks are increasingly targeted without management (or inadequate enforcement of regulations). Shrimp trawling is substantial off southwest Baja California Sur and also off Mazatlan, where declines in catches in other species, overcapacity, and poor governance have been highlighted.&#160;Throughout its Central and South American range, the species is subjected to intense fishing pressure. Recent landings surveys in Costa Rica have recorded relatively few individuals, and anecdotal evidence from fishers indicates that they were previously much more common.&#160;In Colombia, this species is recorded in artisanal fisheries at lower frequency than the 1990s.&#160;Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific. Although this species has a relativity high biological productivity, a lack of management and enforcement throughout most of its range precludes sustainability. This shark may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the relatively remote Pacific coast of Baja California. Overall, due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged fisheries operating in its range, its increasing rarity in some areas, and the degradation of coastal mangrove habitats, balanced with some areas of refuge, it is suspected that the Pacific Sharpnose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (15 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","The Pacific Sharpnose Shark inhabits the continental shelf from the intertidal zone to 100 m (Amezcua-Linares 1996), and it may utilize mangroves as other sharpnose sharks tend to (Gallo <em>et al.</em> 2010). It reaches a maximum size of 154 cm total length (TL) but is more commonly observed at sizes &lt;120 cm TL (Franke and Acero 1991, Márquez-Farías<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005); females mature at 103 cm TL and males at 58–69 cm TL (Hildebrand 1946, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous and females give birth to litters of 2–5&#160;young that are 33–34 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Generation length is suspected to be similar to that of the congeneric Atlantic Sharpnose Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon terranovae</em>) in the Gulf of Mexico at about 5 years (Carlson and Baremore 2003, Loefer and Sedberry 2003).","The Pacific Sharpnose Shark is captured as bycatch in demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and in teleost traps, and is targeted by artisanal gillnets and longlines. These fisheries are generally intense in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. Gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California is high and has led to declines in various marine species including pelagic sharks (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). There is a hake trawl fishery in the northeastern Gulf of California that likely captures this species<em></em>. Shrimp trawling is substantial off southwest Baja California Sur and also off Mazatlan, where declines in catches, overcapacity, and poor governance have been highlighted (Foster and Vincent 2010). In Guatemala, this species is landed commonly with a peak in November that includes neonates (C. Avalos unpubl. data 2019). In Costa Rica and Colombia, shrimp trawl fisheries have declined to the point of being unprofitable, indicating overfishing. In a vulnerability analysis of elasmobranchs in the Costa Rica shrimp  trawl fishery, this species was determined to be highly vulnerable (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2018). These sharks are caught frequently on bottom longlines in Costa Rica. Artisanal net fisheries operate across the species' South American  range, and there is little management in place. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks, have been degraded as a result of coastal development and shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/><br/>Although this species is relatively productive and could probably withstand some fishing pressure, a lack of management and enforcement throughout most of its range precludes sustainability, and there is no refuge at depth. This shark may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the relatively remote Pacific coast of Baja California.","In the Gulf of California, this coastal shark was the second most important shark in artisanal landings between 1960 and 2014, with peaks of 3,000 t in the late 1970s and early 1980s and of over 2,000 t in the early 1990s. Since the mid-1990s landings have been between 1,000 and 2,000 t (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al. </em>2017). Artisanal fisheries there began targeting large predatory sharks in the 1960s, and in the 1970s and 1980s the use of gillnets increased rapidly. After depleting the large predatory sharks, these fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks in the 1990s (Sala <em>et al.</em> 2004). Records from the northern Gulf of California hake fishery are rare. This shark is subjected to intense fishing pressure in Guatemala, and a population reduction is suspected there. In Costa Rica, recent landings surveys have recorded relatively few individuals, and anecdotal evidence from fishers indicates that the species was previously much more common.&#160;In Colombia, this species is recorded in artisanal fisheries at lower frequency than the 1990s (P.A. Mejía-Falla and A.F. Navia, unpubl. data 2019).&#160;Although data are sparse further south, gillnet and trawl fishing pressure is intense and largely unmanaged. Furthermore, mangroves in the region have declined (López-Angarita<em> et al.</em> 2016). Overall, due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged fisheries operating in its range, its increasing rarity in some areas, its lack of refuge from fishing at depth, and the degradation of coastal mangrove habitats, it is suspected that this shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (15 years).",Decreasing,"The Pacific Sharpnose Shark occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from southern California, USA to Peru (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","This shark is targeted and/or caught as retained bycatch through most of its range.

In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted elasmobranch fishing from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is inadequate (O. Sosa-Nishizaki unpubl. data 2019). A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening.&#160;Management measures are needed to ensure that this species does not become more threatened in the near future.

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to a depth of 50 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Coach Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. It is targeted and taken as bycatch across its range with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gill nets, and droplines, longlines and retained for the meat that is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and the skins that are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 50–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines. It is suspected that the Coach Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Coach Whipray occurs in inshore waters from the surface to a depth of 50 m, although it prefers shallow waters (including estuarine waters and sometimes into freshwater) and is often located in intertidal lagoons, reef flats, and reef faces (Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 160 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~82 cm DW and female size-at-maturity is unknown. Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy and litter size is likely two pups based on a single pregnant female, and size-at-birth is 21–28 cm DW (Last et al. 2016, B.M. Majaji-Matsumoto unpubl. data 2015). Little else is known of its biology. Generation length is inferred from a similar species, the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) which has a generation length of 20 years (Jacobsen 2007). The Blackspotted Whipray is smaller than the Coach Whipray (80 cm vs 160 cm DW) and thus as a conservative estimation, the generation length is inferred as 25 years for the Coach Whipray.","Throughout its distribution, the Coach Whipray is taken as target and bycatch in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Intensive longline and gillnetting occurs throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, the Coach Whipray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, hook and line, gillnet, set net, and traps. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3GT vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares et al. 2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and in waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. Since 2004, sharks and rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard et al. 2015, Mizrahi et al. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.<br/><br/>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial), and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as demersal set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the southwest region of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 t per year with 170,000 t per year from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 t from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg per hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast (Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20-25 days (NARA 2003).<br/><br/>In India, juvenile rays are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat. The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over one generation length). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017). There is also a recent increase in fishing pressure on large stingrays, like this species, due to increased demand for export of frozen wings to Thailand and Malaysia in the past six years (M. Khan pers. comm. 11 December 2020). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean, marine fisheries catches reported to FAO have increased over the past 30 years but have levelled off since 1999 suggesting stocks are fully fished. There is concern for serial depletion with the number of species landed near-doubling from only 85 in 1971 to 152 reported in 2000 (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). More than 60 million people reside within 100 km of the coast of the Western Indian Ocean and there is great dependence on marine resources for food and employment (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). Almost 3 million people are directly dependent on artisanal fishing for their livelihood along the shores of East Africa and Madagascar (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). In contrast to many other regions of the world, where industrial fisheries with high-technical gear predominate, fishers in the Western Indian Ocean operate primarily at the subsistence and artisanal level. For example, in Tanzania, no more than 5% of fishers are active in industrial fishing, the other 95% being artisanal (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). Artisanal catches are underreported and most small-scale, artisanal, and subsistence coastal fisheries within the Western Indian Ocean are considered to be fully- or overexploited, especially where they are found close to population centers. Over the last ten years, the number of underexploited fisheries in the coastal zone has tended to decline and such fisheries are now an exception (FAO 2006, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for estuarine and inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There is no population trend estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, reconstructed landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort. This correlated to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t per year in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Coach Whipray (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 93–99%.<br/><br/>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’), and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean, however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber et al. 2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (less than one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Coach Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). This indicates a decrease of 76% in 16 years (less than one generation length) from 1991–2006. There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998–2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019). <br/><br/>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978–1980 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006–2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, questionnaires (n=200) completed by local fishers have indicated a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque, unpubl. data, 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al</em>. 2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because, “it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion” and many attempts were made to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005).<br/><br/>The population has declined significantly off India and Pakistan due to intense and increasing fishing activities. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The same study showed a decline of 83% in the average landings of the Coach Whipray between 1990–2004, which is equivalent to a &gt;99% decline over three generation lengths&#160; (75 years). Although the Coach Whipray is the more common species in India, identification is problematic, and species-specific data is not considered reliable (K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 21 March 2017), and landings would also include Leopard Whipray (Himantura leoparda). In Pakistan, the populations of both local Himantura species have declined by ~50% since 1999 (M. Khan pers. comm. 25 March 2017), the equivalent of an ~95% decline over three generation lengths (75 years) of the Coach Whipray.<br/><br/>These declines are in contrast to other parts of its range, particularly the Arabian/Persian Gulf, where the species is commonly recorded and regularly discarded (and so do not always occur in fish markets), so significant declines are unlikely there. This species is likely present in low numbers in Iranian waters of the Arabian/Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Catches of rays in general in these waters have been around 5,000-6,000 t between 2013 and 2015. Research trawl surveys in the area have indicated an overall increase in the biomass of rays (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006, Valinassab 2016). <br/><br/>Targeted and unmanaged fisheries for whiprays in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zanzibar, are likely to be leading to population reduction. Surveys of fishers in Zanzibar show that most considered shark and ray numbers in general to have decreased on their fishing grounds, concomitant with an increase in the sale value of meat (Jiddawi and Shehe 1999). An ecological risk assessment identified whiptail stingrays as susceptible to southwest Indian Ocean small-scale fisheries (A. Temple pers. comm. 28 July 2018).<br/><br/>Actual levels of exploitation are high across most of the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Coach Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Coach Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Coach Whipray is widespread in the Indo-Pacific in the Eastern and Western Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from South Africa to the Philippines (Last<em>&#160;et al. </em>2016b). The species is a Lessepsian immigrant, having entered the Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal and is present in Egypt and Israel and may extend north to Syria (Serena 2005, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Serena <em>et al. </em>2020).","The meat is used for human consumption. Throughout the Southeast Asian portion of its range, the meat is consumed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the meat is considered good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is occasionally landed at the markets in Singapore and sold to local grocery stores (N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 6 May 2020). Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat, but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand of ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and some anecdotal information suggests in restaurants as well (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Oman, this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption. In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia (M. Khan pers. comm. 28 May 2017). In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2017). The skin of large rays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). In India, ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price.",Marine,"No species-specific measures are in place. Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km2 and in Malaysia, there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² (CTI 2020). Although the specie may occur in these MPAs, most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.<br/><br/>In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles (nm) from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on muro ami gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010 (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer et al. 2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 MPAs (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray et al. 2018).<br/><br/>In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage (GT) are prohibited within three nm from the shore (DoF 2015). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (MacKeracher <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman have banned trawling in their waters while Iran, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, Sri Lanka does not have commercial trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Kuwait is the only country across the range of this species with regulations specifically banning catches of rays.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

Data from Mauritania, where a 'tollo' targeted fishery exists, indicate that there has been a population reduction of &gt;90% over the last three generation lengths of the Atlantic Weasel Shark (39&#160;years). Pressure on the species is unlikely to be this high across the rest of its range where it is mostly caught as&#160;bycatch. Overall, there is limited&#160;species-specific reporting, as well as a lack of species-specific time-series data from the&#160;remaining range of the species. However, considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its&#160;susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in other&#160;sharks (including the Common Smoothhound), it is suspected that the Atlantic Weasel Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79%&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (39 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as&#160;Endangered A2bd. <br/></span>","<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>The Atlantic Weasel Shark occurs inshore and offshore on the continental shelf to&#160;a&#160;depth of&#160;<span style="""">100&#160;m (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).

It is also likely taken in industrial fisheries operating trawls in coastal areas.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Atlantic Weasel Shark that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. Since the 1970s, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker et al. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% between 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly et al. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly et al. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Second, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with population declines even though the Atlantic Weasel Shark still occurs in landings across the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, in the 1990s, this species was a significant bycatch (a large proportion of which were pregnant females) of a fishery targeting sciaenids (<em>Argyrosomus regius </em>and <em>Pseudotholithus </em>spp.) using demersal set gillnets by the traditional Imraguen fishers in the Parc National du Banc D'Arguin (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). It was also one of the five most abundant species of elasmobranchs recorded during monthly surveys undertaken in this park between 1998–2002 (Valadou <em>et al</em>. 2006). While species-specific information is not available, anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was historically very abundant but that targeted fisheries led to severe declines in quantities landed. The species is also captured as bycatch in a targeted fisheries for 'tollo' generally consisting of the Common Smoothhood (<em>Mustelus mustelus</em>) and the Barbeled Houndshark (<em>Leptocharias smithii</em>). Indeed, by the mid-2000s, landings of this species within the Parc National du Banc D'Arguin had significantly declined to the point where it was infrequently reported in landings statistics (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). Annual fisheries statistics from the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches for surveys in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin, collected since 2009, indicate that landings fluctuate between 1 t (in 2013) and 42 t (peak in 2018) (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). Furthermore, data from experimental trawl fishing surveys in the Parc National du Banc D'Arguin indicate a decrease in catch-per-unit effort that is the equivalent of &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths of the Atlantic Weasel Shark (39 years). <br/><br/>Between 2004–2011, this species was recorded during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region in all countries except for Sierra Leone but was not considered abundant (Diop and Dossa 2011, M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). However, it has now become increasingly rare across the region (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). In The Gambia, this species was not recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 although other species of sharks were also infrequently recorded (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Cape Verde, the species was recorded during Baited Remote Underwater Video Surveys undertaken between 2015–2017 with almost 40 individuals sighted in 220 hours of underwater video footage (S. Pires, S. Ratao unpubl. data 2020). The species is frequently caught in artisanal fisheries across the archipelago but landings quantities are not available because data are aggregated with other species such as the Common Smoothhound, Barbeled Houndshark, and the Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>). There, it is targeted for cação (dried shark meat) which has replaced imported cod from Portugal and has resulted in increased targeted shark fisheries (Seymour <em>et al</em>. 2018). There has been no recent records of this species in landing site surveys in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). It was recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985–2012 but data on quantities are not available (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species was considered very rare in landings from drifting gillnets in Côte d’Ivoire (Abidjan Port) between 1991–2003 (N'Goran <em>et al</em>. 2005). More recently, there have been no records of this species in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019 (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, it was not recorded in landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 despite other species of sharks with similar catchability like the Common Smoothhound being recorded (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). This species was listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" trawl surveys with up to four individuals representing 13.56% of catches in one haul from Nigeria in 2004 and two individuals representing 4.88% of catches captured between Gabon and Congo (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, Krakstad et al. 2008). In Nigeria, it was recorded in small quantities in national trawl research surveys in 2009 (A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species represented 3% of sharks captured in 2017 and 8.6% in 2018 and while these were mostly discarded alive they were wounded and in a poor state likely increasing post-release mortality. The Atlantic Weasel Shark, Common Smoothhound, and Barbeled Houndshark together represent an important proportion of shark captures reported by onboard observers with 17.1% in 2016, 28.6% in 2017, 50.4% in 2018 and 34.8% in 2019, with variations in catches over the years likely due to differences in the presence of onboard observers and spatial regulations in process (E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). Records of Atlantic Weasel Shark from the artisanal fisheries operating in Mayumba using demersal set gillnets represent 2% of shark landings (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). These artisanal fisheries capture this species seasonally (dry season from June to September) and CPUE has been stable with an average of 4.5 kg landed per day (peak of 12 kg per day) between 2014–2019, however, fishing effort has increased during the same period (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). In the Republic of the Congo, 24 individuals were recorded during landing site surveys from January 2019 to December 2019, most of which were caught in encircling nets (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). However, visits to industrial landing sites in the past indicate they are captured in trawlers (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, 28 individuals, mostly juveniles, have been recorded over two years of landing site surveys representing 1.3% of all shark and ray records (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). In Angola, it was not recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 but fishers were able to identify the species by looking at shark illustrations during interviews (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>A decline of &gt;90% over the past three generation lengths (39 years) is estimated in Mauritania. Elsewhere, there is limited species-specific reporting, as well as a lack of species-specific time-series data. However, considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in other sharks (including the Common Smoothhound) it is suspected that the Atlantic Weasel Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (39 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation.<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">",Decreasing,"The Atlantic Weasel Shark is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Mauritania to Namibia,&#160;including the&#160;<span style="""">Cape Verde Archipelago</span>&#160;(Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).&#160;A northwest Atlantic record based on a specimen from New England in 1906, and a record from Madagascar, are questionable (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).","The Atlantic Weasel Shark is commercially valuable across its range where it is utilized fresh, smoked, or dried-salted for human consumption (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Across the Cape Verde Archipelago, it is widely consumed as dried shark meat (cação) (S. Pires unpubl. data 2020). Fins are not considered valuable due to their small size but are still traded internationally (P. Doherty, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). It is sometimes processed into fishmeal (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across the region have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including finning bans, gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Atlantic Weasel Shark are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

The Hope, Swift, Wag Water, Cobre, Yallahs, Minho, Buff Bay, Oracabessa, Morant, and Grande Rivers have been deemed in critical condition by the Jamaican government and associated water management units (John 2006). The most recent version of the Jamaican National Environmental Action Plan cites prevalent regional threats related to pollution originating from a number of agriculture, urban, and industrial inputs, alterations to natural flow hydrology due to damming infrastructure, artificial reservoirs, and agricultural irrigation infrastructure, and sedimentation of natural waterways (NEPA 2006). Alluvial mining is a major localized threat to aquatic habitat quality and biodiversity in the Yallahs and Minho rivers (Weeks&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). The Montego River and North Gully are associated with a number of anthropogenic pollutants, including trace metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls associated with agricultural and industrial production (Jaffé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Bauxite mining, limestone quarrying, road construction, and illegal settlements continue to impact remaining pristine habitat in the island's interior (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Mining pressures are expected to increase in future years, thereby increasing deforestation and process waste (NEPA 2006). Tourism presents a significant threat to the future integrity of coastal and lowland habitat (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).</p>  <p>Currently, less than 10% of Jamaica is covered by intact primary forest, and few lowland and coastal habitats remain undisturbed (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). According to a 2006 report, approximately 75% of Jamaica’s freshwater resources (John 2006) and 40-50% of Jamaica’s land area is allocated to agricultural production (Mitchell 2016). Primary agricultural products include poultry, yams, and sugar (Josling&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Use of the organochlorine pesticide endosulfan to control agricultural pests in coffee production has resulted in background levels that are present in freshwater ecosystems, sediments, fish, and shrimp, though runoff events into freshwater habitat are typically sporadic (Ellis-Tabanor and Hyslop 2007). Mass fish die-offs associated with pesticide pollution have been recently reported in the Black River (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).</p>  <p>Tilapia production began in Jamaica in the early 1950s and was initiated by the Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture’s Fishery Division (Cooke and Mooyoung 1983). Historic cultivation of <em>Oreochromis mossambicus</em>, and continuing cultivation of <em>O. niloticus</em> has resulted in establishment of both species throughout most of Jamaica’s natural freshwaters (Cooke and Mooyoung 1983). As of 2001, approximately 526 hectares of aquaculture ponds facilitated the production of Tilapia in Jamaica (Morrison and Vogel 2009). The direct impact of Tilapia establishment on native ichthyofauna in Jamaica has not been studied in detail. Three species of Poeciliids (<em>Poecilia reticulata, Xiphophorus helleri</em>, and <em>X. maculatus</em>) are established in freshwater drainages in Jamaica (Geheber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), but their impact on native ichthyofauna is unknown. The non-native Three-Spot Gourami (<em>Trichogaster trichopterus</em>) has been reported from a single drainage on the northern coast of the island with no evidence of reproduction when it was collected (Geheber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;There are numerous other species which have become established in the islands river systems.

126023418,21574,Marosatherina ladigesi,Vulnerable,D2,2019,2019-07-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Marosatherina ladigesi</em> is a freshwater species endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia. Known to only occur in main rivers of the South Sulawesi province, within the five regencies of Bone, Maros, Pangkajenne, Kepulauan and Sopping. This species faces heavy threats throughout its range, including over-collection for the international aquarium trade and local pesticide run offs from paddy fields, which together have resulted in declines in wild populations and a resultant sex ratio skew. Although studies are underway to create broodstock and help the wild population numbers and trade source alternatives, this species has directly been observed to have declined in number over many years. However, exact population numbers are not known and more surveys are required to establish accurate areas of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) values. This species is assessed as Vulnerable under category D2, with high potential of exploitation changing the species category to Critically Endangered or Extinct in the Wild within a very short space of time, given the already low abundance, skewed sex ratio and sustained trade demands. This species is in urgent need of wild population study to determine its rate of decline within the wild and to better inform conservation efforts to prevent extinction in the wild.","This species occurs in freshwater streams with clear waters and flowing currents. It has been collected over sand based substrates with gravel to rocky floors (Hadiaty 2007). <em>Marosatherina ladigesi </em>is an omnivorous species that lays eggs (Axelrod <em>et al</em>. 1991) and has a peak spawning time in the rainy season (Hadijah <em>et al.</em> 2017). The maximum standard length obtained in Hadiaty (2007) was 44.1 mm for males and 43.8 mm for females. Males are more colourful in appearance than females and develop colourful extensions to their second dorsal and anal fins, thus the priority of wild capture in the aquarium trade.","The main threat to this species is over collection for the international aquarium trade, and other threats include run off of pesticides from rice paddy fields and the destruction of their natural stream habitats&#160;(Hadiaty 2007, Said and Haryani 2011, Jayadi and Husma 2016). <em>Marosatherina ladigesi</em>&#160;that still survive in the wild have extremely low levels of genetic diversity (Jayadi <em>et al.</em> 2015), and thus this low abundance condition may increase the vulnerability of this species, given the exceeded optimum collection limitations of rivers (Bahrul 2014, Jayadi <em>et al. </em>2016a) and difficulty of domesticating the species to provide brood stock as an alternate source for aquarium trade (Jayadi <em>et al. </em>2016b).","The fish is locally known as ""beseng-beseng"" while the trade name is Celebes rainbow fish. <em>Marosatherina ladigesi </em>still holds a high economical value and demand within the aquarium trade, as it has for many years, particularly males for their appearance (Kottelat <em>et al</em>. 1993, Andriani 2000, Said <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nasution <em>et al.</em> 2006, Said and Mayasari 2007, Parenti 2011, Jayadi <em>et al.</em> 2013, Jayadi <em>et al. </em>2015). More recently it has been observed that exploitation rates of wild capture fishes have exceeded the optimum limits in several river studies, in Bantimurung River (Bahrul 2014), Jennae River and Gowa Lorong River (Jayadi <em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2016a).<br/><br/>It was already known to be a species with low abundance from studies by Hadiaty (2007) in surveys conducted in 2007, with more females collected than males. This skewed sex ratio was also found by Hadijah <em>et al.</em> (2017), but may also be from differences in behaviour between the sexes. Collectors at a similar time had also reported that it has become more difficult to obtain around Maros (Hadiaty 2007).",Decreasing,"<em>Marosatherina ladigesi </em>is a freshwater species endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is known to only occur in South Sulawesi province and is found within Bantimurung River and the Pattunung Asue River, Maros Regency (Kariyanti <em>et al</em>. 2014), the Sawae River in Bone Regency, the Jenae River in Pangkajenne and Kepu-lauan Regency, and the Asanae River in Soppeng Regency (Jayadi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Other rivers within the province include Kabupaten Maros, Kabupaten Pangkep, Kabupaten Gowa, and Kabupaten Bone, and the Patununang river near the city of Makassar.","This species is collected for the international aquarium trade and is thought to have been exported from Sulawesi since 1976 (Hadiaty 2007). Prices were known to range from $1.5-5 per head, and importing countries include Germany and the United Kingdom (Hadiaty 2007). Males are more highly sought after than females due to their colourful patterns and extended fins (Jayadi and Husma 2016). This species is also bred in captivity to be sold in the aquarium trade in locations such as Singapore (Hadiaty 2007). Kottelat&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(1993) reported that almost all stocks were taken from the wild and, more recently, studies confirm wild capture of fishes have exceeded the optimum limits in several river studies: in Bantimurung River (Bahrul 2014), Jennae River and Gowa Lorong River (Jayadi <em>et al.</em> 2016a).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"To ensure the sustainability of <em>Marosatherina ladigesi</em> stocks in nature and to meet the over demanded supply for ornamental fish, Jayadi <em>et al</em>. (2016b) proposed the necessity of domestication of the species to produce seeds (larvae and juvenile) to in turn prevent extinction in the wild and supply for trade. Jayadi <em>et al</em>. (2016b) highlights that studies completed have been done on bio-ecology, morphology and karyotype (Andriani 2000), fish reproduction (Nasution <em>et al.</em> 2006), reproduction tests <em>ex situ</em> (Said <em>et al.</em> 2005), feeding habits (Jayadi <em>et al.</em> 2013), infestations of ectoparasites (Amrullah <em>et al.</em> 2013), analysis of fecundity and egg diameter (Kariyanti <em>et al.</em> 2014), and gonadal maturation with live feed (Jayadi <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, there is still limited information available for the domestication of the the species and that success of domestication of <em>Marosatherina ladigesi</em> is generally dependent on the maintenance of broodstock, spawning or breeding and rearing of larvae and juvenile (seed) in captivity (Jayadi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b).",Australasian,,false,false,Global

It is therefore listed as Least Concern.</p><p></p>","<em>Tilapia sparrmanii </em>is a benthopelagic, potamodromous species that occurs in a widely diverse habitat; it favours areas where plant cover exists along the edges of rivers, lakes or swamps and prefers shallow sheltered waters and does not colonize the open water of large lakes. Adults feed preferentially on filamentous algae, aquatic macrophytes and vegetable matter of terrestrial origin (leaves, plants, etc.) (Philippart and Ruwet 1982). Juveniles feed on small crustaceans and midge larvae (de Moor and Bruton 1988). It is used as a forage fish for bass (Skelton 1993). This species undertakes seasonal upstream migration and breeds before and during these migrations (Bell-Cross and Minshull 1988). The male spreads his milt over the cluster of eggs which are deposited on the bottom or even attached to the branches of aquatic weeds. The parents guard the eggs. Eggs and fry may be moved into the mouth to alternative sites during hatching operations but there is no evidence of actual mouth brooding. Newly hatched fry attach to the substrate by head glands and wriggle constantly for aeration. Fry are free-swimming after seven to eight days but remain in a shoal guarded by parents for several weeks (Skelton 2001).","<em>Tilapia sparrmanii </em>is a species that is commercially used for aquaculture. Since the demise of the larger cichlid species in river/floodplain fisheries throughout the Middle and Upper Zambezi (Tweddle <em>et al.</em> 2015),&#160;<em>T. sparrmanii</em>&#160;has become the main fisheries target species with small meshed monofilament gillnets and seine nets in these systems. This could constitute a threat if this trend continues to escalate and the widespread use of dragnets destroys the weeded habitats in which this species occurs.","This species is widespread and abundant over most of its range. It has been increasing in Lake Kariba in the last 10-15 years. In the Upper Zambezi and Kafue floodplains it has become a major component of the artisanal catches following the demise of the larger cichlid species that formerly made up the bulk of fishers' catches (Tweddle <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Tilapia sparrmanii</em> is regarded as an invasive species in extralimital parts of South Africa south of the Orange River system (de Moor and Bruton 1988).<br/>Remarkably, the situation with the populations in Malawi and the Rovuma system is very different. The species does not occur in Lake Malawi itself, though it is found in the very short, open channel connecting Lake Malawi and Chia Lagoon near Nkhotakota on the western central lakeshore. Otherwise it is a species found only in streams and swamps along the lakeshore. It does not occur in the outflowing Shire River, nor in the Lower Zambezi.

The species's habitat is under severe threat from sand mining activity and other developments, such as for housing or fish farming. Additionally, the invasion of the marsh by the introduced grass&#160;<em>Urochloa arrecta</em> and ginger lily <em>Hedychium coronarium</em> appears to render the marshes unsuitable for the species, and represents a considerable threat (Buzzetti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Del-Rio <em>et al</em>. 2017).","Current threats arise from anything affecting the tiny patchwork of marshes that form the entire range of the species.

It has an extremely large range and six subpopulations across which trends are variable. The population trend of the largest subpopulation, <em>islandica</em>, is unclear as is the trend of <em>roselaari</em>. The <em>rufa</em> and <em>canutus</em>&#160;subpopulations have both experienced population declines. Two subpopulations use the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and have experienced significant declines owing to loss of habitat in the Yellow Sea. Should new research resolve uncertainties in the trends of several of these subpopulations the species may warrant uplisting or downlisting.","The species breeds in the high Arctic (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) on dry upland tundra including weathered sandstone ridges, upland areas with scattered willows&#160;<em>Salix</em>&#160;spp.,&#160;<em>Dryas</em>&#160;spp. and poppy, moist marshy slopes and flats in foothills, well-drained slopes hummocked with&#160;<em>Dryas</em>&#160;spp. (Johnsgard 1981) and upland glacial gravel close to streams or ponds (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;The nest is an open shallow depression (Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984) either positioned on hummocks surrounded by mud and water or on stony or gravelly ground or even coastal spits (Johnsgard 1981, Lappo <em>et al. </em>2012) on open vegetated tundra or stone ridges (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species is strictly coastal, frequenting tidal mudflats or sandflats, sandy beaches of sheltered coasts, rocky shelves, bays, lagoons and harbours, occasionally also oceanic beaches and saltmarshes (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).<br/><br/>During the breeding season it feeds predominantly on insects (mainly adult and larval Diptera, Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and bees) as well as spiders, small crustaceans, snails and worms (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). When it first arrives on the breeding grounds, however, the species is dependent upon vegetation (including the seeds of sedges, horsetails&#160;<em>Equisetum</em>&#160;spp. and grass shoots) owing to the initial lack of insect prey (Johnsgard 1981).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species takes intertidal invertebrates such as bivalve and gastropod molluscs, crustaceans (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>1996) (e.g. horseshoe crab&#160;<em>Limulus</em>&#160;spp. eggs) (Karpanty&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), annelid worms and insects, rarely also taking fish and seeds (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). It is a full long-distance migrant that utilises few stopover sites or staging areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The species is vulnerable to extensive land reclamation projects that encroach upon important habitat across its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Kraan <em>et al. </em>2010, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Loss of intertidal stopover habitats due to reclamation activities in the Yellow Sea region of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is thought to be driving declines in shorebird populations (Amano&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Leyrer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Melville <em>et al. </em>2016, Piersma <em>et al. </em>2016). It is estimated that up to 65% of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea region have been lost over the past five decades, with an annual loss of 1.2% per year since the 1980s (Murray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;These losses are attributed to urban, industrial and agricultural expansion within the region with the populations of&#160;<em>C. c. piersmai</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. c. rogersi</em>&#160;both being threatened by development at key staging sites in Bohai Bay, China (Rogers <em>et al. </em>2010, Yang <em>et al. </em>2011, Leyrer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It is threatened by the over-exploitation of shellfish (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Goldfeder and Blanco 2006) which leads directly and indirectly to reductions in prey availability (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Damming of rivers, dredging (which reduces food availability), pollution, aquaculture operations, renewable energy developments, oil exploration and invasion of mudflats by <em>Spartina</em> grasses pose additional threats to key habitats (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006, Niles <em>et al. </em>2010, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Melville <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;<br/><br/>The species also suffers from disturbance in the non-breeding season as a result of tourism (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006), residential development (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014) foot-traffic on beaches (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002, Niles <em>et al. </em>2010, Lilleyman <em>et al. </em>2016), recreational activities and over-flying aircraft, which together reduce the size of available foraging areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). In the past, increased harvesting of Horseshoe Crab <em>Limulus polyphemus</em> in Delaware Bay, U.S.A. resulted in reduced prey availability (McGowan <em>et al. </em>2011, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is hunted illegally for example in New Zealand (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) and northern Brazil (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014), and potentially in China (Melville <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;<em>C. c. islandica</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. c. canutus</em>&#160;are both huntable in France and hunting of other species can cause disturbance and accidental mortality. The species can also suffer mortality by incidentally being caught in fish traps (Melville <em>et al. </em>2016). It has been susceptible to avian influenza in the past so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), although testing since 1992 in northwest Australia has not found any evidence for this disease in the species there (Curran <em>et al. </em>2014). Climate change induced sea level rise and thawing of permafrost pose threats to intertidal staging areas, non-breeding sites and Arctic breeding areas (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Wauchope <em>et al. </em>2016).","The global   population is estimated to number 891,000-979,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 15,000-30,000 pairs, which equates to 30,000-60,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015), and the population overwintering in Australia and the Americas have been estimated at 110,000 individuals (Hansen <em>et al. </em>2016) and 44,763 individuals (Niles <em>et al. </em>2010) respectively.",Decreasing,"The species has an extremely large range, breeding from Alaska (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>) across the Arctic to Greenland (<strong>Denmark</strong>) and northern <strong>Russia</strong>.

Within Europe, it has experienced moderate declines&#160;which have not been compensated for by increases elsewhere in the species' range. Declines are thought to be driven by a range of threats including overharvesting of aquatic resources, pollution, disturbance and hunting. Should the declines be found to be more severe, or new information reveal declines in the <em>S. m. sedentaria</em> and <em>S. m. borealis</em> populations, then the species would warrant uplisting; it almost meets the requirements for listing as threatened under criterion A4abcde.","<p>The Common Eider always nests on the ground, and usually in areas free of mammalian predators (Waltho and Coulson 2015), including coastal islands and islets along low-lying rocky coasts, on coastal shores and spits, on islets in brackish and freshwater lagoons, coastal lakes and rivers or on tundra pools close to the coast (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). They use a wide range of nesting habitats, including bare ground, shingle, grassland, scrub, under trees and in derelict buildings (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The nest is a slight hollow in the ground that is usually positioned in the shelter of rocks or vegetation but may also be in the open (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Large nesting aggregations form where safe nesting sites are at a premium (Waltho and Coulson 2015).</p><p>These species typically moults on shallow marine or sheltered coastal waters free from disturbance (Kear 2005; Waltho and Coulson 2015). It winters on shallow coasts (usually &lt;10m depth), bays and estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Waltho and Coulson 2015), especially where there are high abundances of benthic molluscs,&#160;particularly <em>Mytilus edulis</em> (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015). It may also occur inland on freshwater lakes when on passage and during the winter (rarely) (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Its diet consists predominantly of benthic molluscs,&#160;especially <em>Mytilus edulis</em>, although a wide range of crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and isopods), echinoderms, other marine invertebrates and fish may also be taken (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015). During the breeding season incubating females in the Arctic &#160;are reported to feed on &#160;algae, berries and the seeds and leaves of surrounding tundra plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), while in temperate regions they do not&#160;feed, which leads to the temporary breakdown of their digestive system (Waltho and Coulson 2015, Laursen and Møller 2016), Northern populations of this species are migratory (&gt;1000km), but southern populations are largely sedentary (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Migratory nature is largely a response to coastal sea ice (Waltho and Coulson 2015).<br/></p><p></p>","<p>The critical factor for the long-term survival of the species appears to be the survival rate of young ducklings (Waltho and Coulson 2015), but it is not clear which factors are causing the low duckling survival. Past mass mortality in ducklings has been caused by viral infections (1996, 1999) (Hollmén 2002), and the impact of this is likely aggravated by low availability and low nutritional quality of food supplies which is associated with poor body condition in females at the onset of the breeding season (Desholm <em>et al</em>. 2003). Avian cholera appears to be a potentially significant threat with mass mortality events noted at several colonies in Denmark and in Canada (Kats 2007, Descamps <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tjørnløv <em>et al.</em> 2013), and according to Descamps <em>et al.</em>’s (2012) model, only a few recurrent outbreaks would be sufficient to cause colony extinction within a relatively short time. Other diseases may also impact populations, e.g. Wellfleet Bay Virus has caused heavy mortality in Massachusetts, US (Ballard <em>et al.</em> 2012) but high parasite loads are considered to be a symptom of other detrimental impacts rather than a primary driver of decline (Kats 2007).</p>  <p>Conflict with the shellfish aquaculture industry can have detrimental effects on certain populations (Kear 2005, Ens 2006). Over-harvesting of benthic molluscs has led to mass starvation events in the past, particularly where secondary prey resources are targeted, as with intensive fishing of <em>Spisula</em> clams during a period of low mussel stocks prior to a mass mortality event in 1999-2000 in the Dutch Wadden Sea and southern North Sea (Camphuysen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Ens 2006, Kats 2007). The species is also impacted by the extensive use of gillnets, and commonly becomes entangled and drowned in monofilament nets, and significant mortality may occur where fishing effort overlaps with Eider aggregations (Kear 2005, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Levels of hunting are high within several countries within the range, and have been considered unsustainable in Russia (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006), Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Greenland (where annual bags exceeded 80,000 in the late 1990s) (Merkel 2004). New restrictions introduced in 2004 appear to have enabled populations to recover considerably (Merkel 2010). In North America, the harvest may still exceed sustainable levels in certain areas (Kear 2005).&#160; Populations in the high Arctic are subject to shooting by indigenous peoples for food, especially in spring (Byers and Dickson 2001, Kear 2005), but this subsistence hunting is likely to be sustainable at current levels (Byers and Dickson 2001). An associated threat is that of lethal and sub-lethal lead exposure through ingestion of lead shot by adult birds, with 23% of females dying of emancipation after incubation were diagnosed with severe or sub-clinical lead poisoning (Hollmén 2002), and 22% of birds collected through hunting in Greenland over three years carried embedded shot pellets (Falk <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>The species is vulnerable to chronic coastal oil pollution and to major oil spills especially in areas where large moulting and wintering concentrations occur (Kear 2005, Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015, Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2017). While one major incident has the potential to be disastrous, levels of chronic oil-related mortality appears relatively stable in the southern North Sea and Wadden Sea, at between 4-12% of estimated winter mortality (Camphuysen <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>  <p>Disturbance from the development of mineral resources along the coast (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006) and from local shore-based activities such as angling and dog walking increases the likelihood of predation on young (Keller 1991). Other recreational activities such as boat tours (Burnham <em>et al.</em> 2012), as well as scientific research (Bolduc and Guillemette 2003) are also likely to reduce productivity at certain locations (Keller 1991). In winter, unregulated tourism and shipping also cause disturbance to the species, and may prevent access to favoured feeding grounds (Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>Additional threats include predation of breeding females in Europe by the increased population of White-tailed Eagle <em>Haliaeetus albicilla</em> and nest predation by introduced mink <em>Mustela vison</em> (Kats 2007, Ekroos <em>et al.</em> 2012) and in the Americas by introduced foxes <em>Vulpes</em> spp. (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2015). Increasing incidence of nesting in tight association with gull colonies and in less exposed sites, may reflect antipredator responses.</p>  <p>The species may also be sensitive to the effects of climate change, though assessing the impacts on population dynamics is problematic as negative effects (e.g. lower growth in prey leading to reduced food availability [Carboneras <em>et al.</em> 2012]) are confounded by potential positive impacts deriving from earlier arrival on breeding grounds improving breeding success in some areas (D’Alba <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>  Mussel quality, and subsequent eider breeding condition, increases with higher nutrient content of coastal waters (Laursen and Møller 2014) so recent reductions in the level of eutrophication of near-shore waters may have contributed to lower food availability.&#160; Thiamine deficiency has been linked to a lethal paralytic syndrome that has caused mass mortality of Eider ducklings. Unlike Herring Gulls <em>Larus argentatus</em>, Common Eider females will lay eggs even below the critical threshold of thiamine, with resultant rapid mortality in hatchlings (Balk <em>et al.</em> 2009). The extent to which this impacts the population is unknown, and is unlikely to account for the strongly skewed sex ratio observed in the species (Lehikoinen <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, the causes of lethal thiamine deficiency need further investigation as there may be a widespread pollutant present that is currently unidentified. Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, with potential reverberations up the trophic chain. In the Baltic, the impact is thought to be sufficiently low to not cause declines (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011).<p></p>","<p>The global population is estimated to number c. 3,300,000-4,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2012), which equates to 1,580,000-1,910,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 791,000-955,000 pairs.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The breeding range of this species is widely distributed around the mid- to high-latitude coasts of the northern hemisphere, particularly at the higher latitudes. It has a Holarctic distribution, being present in both Eurasia and North America. However, its distribution is not continuous across the Holarctic. There are distinct and persistent gaps in both the central parts of the Russian Arctic and the Canadian Arctic. The distributional gap in Russia (54° longitude) is considerably wider than that in Canada (6° longitude). These gaps can be attributed to the presence of ice all year round at these locations, especially landfast sea ice. At the highest latitudes, the presence of breeding birds is largely limited by the distribution of ice-free conditions during June.</p><p>In winter, the range is more compressed, with migratory northern populations largely wintering within the range of the southerly sedentary populations (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The southern limits of regular wintering ranges are southern Alaska (USA) at 51°N, New Jersey (USA) at 41°N, W France at 44°N and Kuril Islands (Russia) at 50°N (Waltho and Coulson 2015).</p><p>Globally there are six widely recognised subspecies (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015), with four in Eurasia: European (<em>S. mollissima mollissima</em>), Faroes (<em>S. m. faeroeensis</em>), Northern (<em>S. m. borealis</em>) and Pacific (<em>S. mollissima v-nigrum</em>). There are four subspecies in North America: Pacific (<em>S. mollissima v-nigra</em>), American (<em>S. m. dresseri</em>), Hudson Bay (<em>S. m. sedentaria</em>), and Northern (<em>S. m. borealis</em>) (Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>EU Birds Directive Annex II and III.

However the hunting regulations have recently changed and the effect on the population is not yet known.

Over the next three generations (18 years), this decline is likely to become rapid  as a result of land reclamation on tidal flats and disturbance at colonies, resulting in the species's listing as Vulnerable. <p></p> <p></p>","The species nests on the ground and is restricted to common seepweed <em>Suaeda glauca </em>saltmarsh habitats. Wintering birds are found on estuarine tidal flats, with regular movements between different sites, dependent on weather and food supply.<p></p>","<p>The key threat facing this species is loss and degradation of the tidal flats and saltmarshes, and the subsequent loss of Common Seepweed <em>Suaeda glauca</em>, which is essential for breeding. In Yancheng National Nature Reserve, one of three breeding and wintering areas in China, the area of Common Seepweed reduced by 79% between 1992 and 2007, with the majority being replaced by aquaculture ponds (Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2010). Farmland area increased by 12% within Yancheng National Nature Reserve (Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2010), likely contributing to the loss of Common Seepweed. Further to this, there has been a continual increase in the ‘built-up’ area of Yancheng NNR in the period 1988-2006 (Ke <em>et al.</em> 2011), likely both for housing and commercial use. Reclamation developments associated with the Tianjin New Coastal District project, started in 2006, seriously impacted an important wintering area by autumn 2011, resulting in a substantial loss of inter-tidal mudflats in Tianjin municipality (P. Holt <em>in litt</em>. 2012). This conversion has occurred across much of the breeding range. Land use changes cause fragmentation of costal landscape and decreasing breeding habitat; changing water levels lead to losses of nests and chicks from rising water. There are no regulations to prevent the continued building of factories in Yancheng NNR (Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p>The introduced invasive <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> is displacing Common Seepweed in large swathes of habitat. The area of Yancheng NNR occupied by <em>Spartina </em><em> alterniflora</em> increased by almost 400% between 1992 and 2007, over 90% of the increased area was mudflat prior to the growth&#160; of&#160;&#160;<em><em>Spartina </em>alterniflora</em> (Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2010). The colonisation of mudflats by&#160;<em><em>Spartina</em> alterniflora</em>&#160;causes sedimentation and constrains the natural transition of coastal vegetation, causing seepweed patches to thicken and become unsuitable for nesting (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2010). In 2010, only two patches of<em> </em><em><em>Suaeda </em> glauca</em> communities suitable for breeding remained in Yancheng NNR.</p>  <p>Egg collection represents a significant threat; major breeding site Shuangtai Hekou NNR supports 20,000 seasonal employees, known to collect eggs for food. Egg collection is also a problem in Yancheng NNR (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2009). Small-scale collection of bio resources, such as crabs, clamworm and seepweed, which disrupts incubation and causes desertion of breeding sites, increases risk of predation of chicks and eggs (Jiang<em> et al.&#160;</em>2010) and has been recorded in Yancheng NNR and Shuangtai Hekou NNR.</p>  <p>The Yellow River Delta NNR, the third major breeding site for <em>Saundersilarus saundersi</em> in China, contains China’s second largest oilfield (The Diplomat 2016). This likely contributes to habitat loss and degradation, with the oil extraction activities thought to contribute to the high level of subsidence in the area (Zhang et al. 2015), as well as the disturbance of birds. Oil field exploration has been undertaken within Shuangtai Hekou National Park, with more than 100 drilling sites in 2002 (Kanai <em>et al</em>. 2002). There have not been any studies on the specific impacts to Saunders's Gull, however it does not seem to be causing significant decline in the population.</p><p></p>","A population estimate of 14,400 mature individuals has been derived from analysis of records and surveys by BirdLife International (2011).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory and breeds from April or May to June or August (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in isolated solitary pairs (Fjeldsa 2004), sometimes also nesting in loose colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) of up to c.20 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). Post-breeding adults undergo a flightless wing-moulting period (Fjeldsa 2004) after which they migrate south either singly or in small loose flocks, with concentrations of over 2,000 individuals occurring at favoured staging sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). During the winter the species typically feeds singly and rarely aggregates into flocks (Fjeldsa 2004). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on small (less than 3 ha), shallow (less than 2 m deep) inland waters with abundant emergent vegetation&#160;(e.g. reedbeds),&#160;and stretches of open water, showing a preference for waters in forested areas or in shrub tundra further to the north (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldsa 2004). Suitable habitats include small pools and lakes, backwaters of large rivers, pools cut off from the sea in estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and coastal lagoons (Fjeldsa 2004). In coastal locations the species often makes foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas, and if foraging at sea it shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). <em>Non-breeding</em> When moulting, on passage or during the winter the species frequents large inland lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldsa 2004) or shallow coastal areas (Fjeldsa 2004) with abundant fish stocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), often considerable distances from the shore, amongst islands in archipelagos or over drop-off zones (Fjeldsa 2004). When foraging at sea the species shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of invertebrates (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as adult and larval aquatic insects (e.g. water beetles, water bugs and dragonfly larvae), crayfish and molluscs (Konter 2001), although fish are also be important locally or seasonally (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species typically breeds in isolated pairs with more than 50 m between neighbouring nests (Fjeldsa 2004), although in some cases (e.g. on predator-free islands of floating vegetation attached to emergent vegetation beds) semi-colonial nesting may occur (Fjeldsa 2004).","<p>The introduction of large fish, such as the non-native Rainbow Trout, to many inland waterbodies for freshwater fisheries and recreational fishing has resulted in greatly increased resource competition for invertebrate and smaller fish prey (HELCOM Red List 2013). The productivity and suitability of waterbodies used by the species is also thought to be impacted by the expansion of timber plantations throughout the boreal zone, however, the impacts of this are presently unknown. The species is also highly susceptible to bycatch in gillnets, with tens to hundreds caught annually in the Baltic Sea (Zydelis <em>et al</em>. 2013). This is considered likely to be the driver of a very rapid decline over the past few decades in the Baltic Sea (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011) but represents only a small part of the global wintering range. Bycatch is also a threat in North American coastal waters.</p>  Red-necked Grebes were among the species most severely impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, demonstrating little recovery in numbers within three years (Day <em>et al.</em> 1997). However, its very large range places only a small proportion at risk of direct mortality in a single incident. Persistent organochlorine pollution has been documented to reduce egg viability dramatically in the past, thus greatly reducing reproductive success (De Smet 1987), but bans on the use of such compounds has reduced the threat this poses to populations. Many freshwater sites throughout the breeding range have become eutrophied through the effects of agricultural run-off and large-scale freshwater fisheries, the impact of which is unknown. It is considered to be at relatively high risk of collision with wind turbines and other offshore infrastructure due to undertaking nocturnal flights and having only low manoeuvrability (Garthe and Hüppop 2004), although the effect of this on the population has not been quantified. The species has also been recognised as a species of high vulnerability to climate change in a full life-cycle assessment in America (Culp <em>et al.</em> 2017), but actual impacts presently unknown.","The global   population is estimated to number c.190,000-290,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015), while national population estimates include:   c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs, c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and   c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in China; &lt; c.100 breeding pairs, &lt;   c.50 individuals on migration and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in   Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on   migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).&#160;The European population is estimated at 27,700-47,900 pairs, which equates to 55,400-95,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species can be found in western <strong>Canada</strong>, north-west <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, eastern <strong>Russia</strong>, north-east <strong>China</strong> and northern <strong>Japan</strong>, wintering from Japan and <strong>Korea</strong> through the Aleutian Islands to California (both U.S.A.), and off eastern the U.S.A. south to Florida.

It experienced declines of more than 70% in the period 1990-2000 as indicated from fisheries catch statistics. Information on the status of this species is available mainly for Lake Malawi, the Upper Shire and Lake Malombe (but it should be noted that direct observation finds that even in other parts of the Shire River chambo catches had declined over the same 10 year period). The total Chambo catch (for Lake Malawi, Upper Shire and Lake Malombe combined) in 1980 was 10,711 tons, increasing to 17,439 tons in 1982. However, by 1990 it had declined to 6,483 dropping further to 2,774 tons in 1996. This inferred a reduction of more than 70% in the catches over that ten-year period. Further monitoring in southern Lake Malawi found that Chambo stocks had continued to decline at the same rate during 1994-1999. On the basis of this previously reported decline the species was assessed as Endangered in 2004. Since this time there have been very limited data at the species level. Information on the CPUE of ""Chambo"" from the commercial fisheries catch records from the southern arms of the lake, excluding Area A, up to Senga Bay over the period 2006-2016 shows a decline in the CPUE from 70 kg/day/boat to 4.5 kg/day/boat in 2016.

Although the data have not been recorded at the level of species, of the three species comprising ""Chambo"" <em>Oreochromis lidole </em>is now possibly extinct (G. Turner pers. comm). Based on this information we assume the decline in CPUE for <em>O. karongae</em> over the period 2006-2016 is approximately 94%.

Like other species of the subgenus <em>Nyasalapia</em>, males of <em>O. karongae</em> develop long branched genital 'tassels' that serve as egg dummies. Territorial male <em>O. karongae</em> are jet black, with a white dorsal fin margin. <em>O. karongae</em> can be seen in loose shoals in many areas of the lake. They feed by rasping the surfaces of rocks and weeds and by sifting sediment and also feeding in the water column. They eat mainly algae, detritus and zooplankton. The breeding season runs from July to March, peaking around September and again in February. In Lake Malombe there is just a single peak around July to October. Like other <em>Oreochromis</em> they are maternal mouthbrooders. Males dig large spawning platforms in waters ranging from the shallows, down to depths of at least 28 m. Like other chambo, they construct a slightly raised bowl-shaped central spawning cone inside the larger pit. The maximum size is 37 cm TL.","Over-fishing is the primary threat. Chambo are the most valuable food fishes in Malawi, but populations collapsed in the 1990s as a result of over-fishing. An additional threat is posed by the introduction of <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em>&#160;(Genner <em>et al</em>. 2013) which may hybridize with <em>O. karongae</em>.","During the 1950s over 3,000 tonnes of Chambo per year (chiefly <em>O. squamipinnis</em>) were being taken from Lake Malawi's southeast arm alone. However, the total catch for chambo in this part of the lake has shown a steady decline since early 1990s. CPUE in the main harvesting fisheries has also declined dramatically due to over-fishing. In Lake Malombe chambo catches were around 4,000 tons in the late 1970s, increasing to over 6,000 tons in the early 1980s. In the late 1980s a drastic decline was observed with catches falling to less than 600 tons per year by the early 1990s and to less than 200 tons in the late 1990s. This decline in total catch in Lake Malombe is directly matched by severe declines in CPUE in the two main fisheries harvesting the stock, namely gill nets and chambo seines.

Like other species of the subgenus <em>Nyasalapia</em>, males develop long branched genital 'tassels' that serve as egg dummies. It feeds on algae, detritus and zooplankton. The breeding season is in the rainy season running from December to April. Like other <em>Oreochromis</em>, they are maternal mouthbrooders. Males dig large spawning pits in the sand at depths of 2–20 m.  Max. size: 36 cm TL.","The chambo are the most valuable food fishes in Malawi, but populations collapsed in the 1990s as a result of over-fishing.

However, the total catch for chambo in this part of the lake has shown a steady decline since early 1990s. CPUE in the main harvesting fisheries has also declined dramatically due to over-fishing. In Lake Malombe chambo catches were around 4,000 tons in the late 1970s, increasing to over 6000 tons in the early 1980s. In the late 1980s a drastic decline was observed with catches falling to less than 600 tons per year by the early 1990s and to less than 200 tons in the late 1990s. This decline in total catch in Lake Malombe is directly matched by severe declines in CPUE in the two main fisheries harvesting the stock, namely gill nets and Chambo seines. The Chambo stocks in Lake Malombe are considered to have been in a state of collapse or near collapse since the early 1990s.<br/><br/>Since 2000 there have been very limited data at the species level. Information on the CPUE of ""Chambo"" from the commercial fisheries catch records from the southern arms of the lake, excluding Area A, up to Senga Bay over the period 2006 - 2016 shows a decline in the CPUE from 70 kg/day/boat to 4.5 kg/day/boat in 2016.

(2015) provided an extensive review of the habitats and ecology of <em>Batagur affinis</em>. The species inhabits estuaries, mangrove creeks, lower river sections, and coastal lagoons, generally in areas influenced by the tide, but may also occur substantial distances upriver (e.g. Perak). Nests on sand banks, either in rivers or on sandy beaches, and females may make substantial migrations between nesting and feeding grounds (up to 80 km) (Moll 1980, 1985).&#160;Females mature at 45 cm CL and may reach 60 cm; males mature at around 40 cm CL and can reach up to 49 cm (Moll 1985). This may occur at an age of nine years in captivity, and require up to 25 years in rivers with modest productivity (Moll 1980). Females may produce up to three nests per nesting season. In Perak, Malaysia, clutch size averages 26 eggs (range 5-38) (Moll 1980).&#160;</p>","Moll <em>et al</em>. (2015) provided an extensive review of the many threats to <em>Batagur affinis.</em>&#160;The species is heavily exploited both for its flesh and its large eggs, and also threatened by habitat destruction, sand mining, and construction of hydropower dams (Moll 1990, Moll and Moll 2000, Sharma and Tisen 2000, Iskandar and Erdelen 2006, Platt <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Thailand (Moll 1990) both types of exploitation have been significant and the species has been largely extirpated from the wild in that country, except for a small relict population in the Langun River area (Kalyar <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Malaysia religious beliefs and customs have reduced the killing of adult turtles for food. Sharma and Tisen (2000) listed dam construction, egg harvest, removal of riparian vegetation, sand mining, and incidental drowning in fishing nets as among the most important threats to the turtle. However, with the recent vast demand for turtles for consumption in China, poaching likely has been taking a steadily more significant toll (Rhodin 2000, van Dijk 2000, Compton 2000, Turtle Conservation Coalition 2011, Horne <em>et al</em>. 2012). The exploitation of the eggs in Malaysia became highly organized from the 1970s into the 1990s and included licensing of nesting beaches and commercial selling at rural and urban markets (Siow and Moll 1981; Moll 1984; Moll and Moll 2000, 2004). As of 2009, three licenses for collecting terrapin eggs were still given out to local villagers on the Perak River. The extent of poaching in Malaysia, due to its illegal nature, is not known but is likely significant, especially along the west coast, which has a larger Chinese population. Law protects the species, but enforcement in tidal areas tends to be lax. Interviews with riverine dwellers near Telok Intan (Moll 1990) indicated that terrapin caught incidentally by fishermen are often sold. Some fishermen purposely set nets for the terrapin (blocking small tributaries following high tide) while others fish for the turtle with hooks baited with mangrove fruit (e.g., <em>Sonneratia</em> sp.). An informant told one of us (EM) that, during an unusually dry period when the Perak River was low, a truckload of terrapins had been taken from the Telok Intan area. Egg collectors at Bota also claimed that female terrapins are being captured as they migrate upriver to nest. Their captors keep them in captivity until they lay their eggs. In some cases these captors reputedly beat on the turtle’s shell and hang them by their necks in order to make them drop their eggs. Other turtles are slaughtered to obtain the eggs.<br/><br/><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">Habitat alteration and destruction have become increasingly significant factors leading to the decline of river terrapins in many areas of Asia. Sand mining and dams are among the worst threats. Commercial sand removal for construction purposes is destroying nesting beaches throughout tropical Asia (Moll 1984, 1990, 1997). Dams located downriver from nesting sites prevent migrations between feeding and nesting sites. Dams upriver from nesting sites do not allow sand to move down river to replenish that lost to erosion or sand mining at nesting beaches. The Kedah River in Malaysia exemplifies the above problems. Dams have been built both above and below the nesting areas and sand mining has destroyed all significant nesting beaches (Moll 1984, 1987, 1997; Moll and Moll 2000, 2004).<br/><br/><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">Other important indirect factors include deforestation and siltation of rivers. On Malaysia’s Perak River the combination of deforestation and tin mining has led to a major increase in the silt load that<span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#160;may be the cause of increased and unseasonal floods. Unseasonal floods are particularly damaging if they occur during the nesting season, when a high percentage of the annual reproductive effort may be destroyed. A 1967 flood not only destroyed the entire reproductive output on the Perak River, but also destroyed 200 eggs in the state Game Department’s hatchery (Balasingam and Khan bin Momin Khan 1969,<span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#160;Khan bin Momin Khan 1977). Additionally floods deposit silt on nesting beaches that promotes the growth of tropical grasses on the sand. As nesting river terrapins require open sand banks for nesting, these grasses effectively destroy former nesting sites (Moll 1997).<br/><br/><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">Habitat destruction is also a problem in the feeding areas of the estuary. Clearing banks of vegetation in downstream areas has lowered the river’s productivity and carrying capacity by directly eliminating food sources. In the Perak River, plantation clearance has destroyed riverside mangroves on which the turtles feed, and replaced them with rip rap (large rocks) to control erosion. Commercial prawn farms are transforming mangrove swamps into ponds. Tidal barrages have also been built which block entry into many of the small tributary streams where river terrapins feed during high tide (Lim and Das 1999; Moll 1984, 1997; Moll and Moll 2000, 2004). A highway currently being constructed in Terengganu may affect nesting in the Terengganu River due to light pollution. Lights from a water treatment plant in the Dungun River illuminate the major nesting banks in Pasir Kumpal and Tok Chu. The plant has recently agreed to shut down this lighting during the nesting season (Chan, unpubl. data).<br/><br/><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">A large shrimp farm occupying 1000 hectares along the Chalok River (a branch of the Setiu River in Terengganu) has recently begun operations (Chan, pers. comm.). Its construction was approved despite opposition of conservation organizations such as WWF and many individuals. Huge marine shrimp farms located on the banks of rivers discharge effluents that can potentially increase salinization while introducing microbial pathogens and residues of chemicals and drugs. The water chemistry of the river is altered and the potential nutrient loading can cause eutrophication. Any increase in salinity is likely to impact the vegetation on which terrapins feed. Due to these concerns, the Department of Environment Malaysia in 2013 required this new shrimp farm to construct a discharge channel directly into the ocean.</span></span></span>","<p>Subpopulations of <em>Batagur affinis</em> are severely depleted throughout its range and extirpated from many former areas of occurrence (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/><br/>In Cambodia, a small subpopulation was rediscovered in the Sre Ambel and Kaong River system in 2001 (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2003), and a juvenile was found in the Stung Proat River in neighbouring Botum Sakor District (Holloway and Sovannara 2004). Heng Sovannara (pers. comm.) reported that over a five-year period (2002–2007) 23 nests were found on the Sre Ambel and Kaong Rivers, an average of 4.6 (range, 3–7) nests per year. However, only a single nest containing 23 eggs was found along the Sre Ambel in 2009 (Sovannara and Gately 2009).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Nutaphand (1979) reported that remnant river terrapin populations persisted in only three provinces, Phattalung, Songkhla, and Ranong. In a 1989–90 survey, Nutaphand found evidence that <em>Batagur</em> still occurred in two provinces near the Malaysian border, Phattalung (Pattharung) and Satun (Satoon) (Nutaphand 1990a, Moll 1990). Thirakupt and van Dijk (1994) and van Dijk and Palasuwan (2000) declared <em>B. affinis</em> to be extinct in the wild in Thailand, although Kalyar <em>et al</em>. (2007) reported a few wild individuals persist in the Klong Langu River.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, <em>B. affinis</em> was once very common on the major rivers throughout Peninsular Malaysia (Boulenger 1912, Moll <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. 2015). However, since the end of World War II the species has undergone a major decline and populations in the western river drainages are currently Critically Endangered. Exploitation of adult river terrapins in Malaysia has been less than in some countries of the region for several reasons. Islam, the predominant religion in Malaysia, teaches that the flesh of amphibious animals is “<em>haram</em>” (forbidden by religious law). Eggs, on the other hand, are considered a delicacy and thought to have aphrodisiacal properties. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, harvesting of “<em>tuntung</em>” eggs was the prerogative of royalty, and nesting beaches were protected from general exploitation. <br/><br/>The case of the Perak River population in Malaysia was likely typical of what occurred throughout the country during the War (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). Prior to 1940, the nesting terrapin population probably exceeded 10,000 turtles, and some 375,000 to 500,000 eggs were laid annually on Perak sandbanks (Loch 1951; Khan bin Momin Khan 1964; Moll 1978, 1980, 1985; Siow and Moll 1981; Moll and Moll 2004). However, during the Japanese occupation food was scarce and previously unexploited sources of protein (such as the river terrapin) were heavily utilized. By the end of the war, <em>B. affinis</em> populations had been decimated. A survey conducted in 1976 estimated the numbers of nesting females to be between 400 and 1200 and egg production on the Perak River at less than 20,000 per year (Moll 1980). In 1989–90 the river terrapin population on the Perak River laid 25,098 eggs in 923 nests. Depending on whether these turtles average one, two, or three clutches per year, this would place the number of nesting females at between 307 and 923 (Moll 1990). In 1990–91 20,608 eggs were laid in 849 nests, indicating between 283 and 849 females in the nesting population. In 1999, only 677 nests were reported. Hendrie (2004) visited nesting sites on three Malaysian Rivers in February of 2004. On the Perak River, he reported that only eight nests were found in 2003 and that 20 had been reported as of 2 February in 2004 (near the end of the nesting season). More recent data provided by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) to E.H. Chan indicate no more than 40 wild nests were found from Perak River sand banks between 2005 and 2009. After 2009 no records of wild nests were available. Captive females at the Bota Kanan facility made 35 to 55 nests per annum between 2010–2013.<br/><br/>Also in Malaysia, on the Terengganu River, an island known as Pasir Lubok Kawah was for many years the most productive nesting beach for river terrapins. According to the staff at the Bukit Paloh Hatchery in Kuala Berang, an average of 60 females nested there annually from 1976 until 1987. Completion of a large dam upriver from the site in the early 1980s led to progressive erosion of the island until nesting suddenly plummeted with only seven females nesting there in 1988 and 1989 (Moll 1990, 1997). Due to the damage to nesting beaches along the Terengganu River, the hatchery and head-starting programme of the Terengganu Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) shifted some of its egg collecting to the Dungun River. However, recent data from the DWNP suggests a reversal of nesting decline on the Terengganu River. In 2008, 99 nests from 95 females were recorded, representing the highest nest numbers since river monitoring began in 1977 (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2008). These numbers have been maintained from 2009 to 2013, with numbers of nests ranging from 80 to 97 annually. In the Dungun River 30 to 49 nests have been recorded annually from 2009 to 2013 (DWNP data to E.H. Chan). The Setiu River in Terengganu has been monitored for nesting activity since 2004; Chan and Chen (2011) reported that from 2004–2009 the number of nests per year ranged from 17–30. This has dropped to no more than 10 in recent years. A newly discovered population in the Kemaman River has yielded 36–121 nests per year between 2012–2014 (P.N. Chen, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Subpopulations no doubt historically occurred in the mangrove swamps surrounding Singapore, but are now evidently extinct (Lim and Das 1999, Ng and Lim 2010). Introduced subpopulations of unknown size are apparently present in several inland reservoirs; whether or not these animals are reproducing has yet to be determined (Ng and Lim 2010; B.D. Horne pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Relatively few localities are known for <em>B. affinis</em> in Indonesia, all of them from the eastern portions of Sumatra (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mistar <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted surveys of North Sumatra, Riau, Jambi, and Lampung provinces along the eastern coast of Sumatra and concluded that although historically present, <em>B. affinis</em> is now most likely extirpated from this region. Habitat along the rivers of eastern Sumatra has been heavily impacted by human settlements and sand mining. However, terrapin eggs (presumably <em>B. affinis</em>) were available for sale in local markets in 2010, and according to information received from local fishers a remnant population of <em>B. affinis</em> may still persist in the Indragiri River and mangrove swamps around Mumpa (Enok District, Indragiri Regency).</p>        <p></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Batagur affinis affinis</em> occurs along the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia and eastern Sumatra in Indonesia and southernmost Thailand (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). <em>Batagur affinis</em> <em>edwardmolli</em> is distributed along the eastern coast of Peninsular Malaysia and the Songkhla region of adjacent southernmost eastern peninsular Thailand bordering the South China Sea, and Cambodia, where a relict population survives in the Sre Ambel River system.

The species continues to be impacted by habitat degradation, principally this is increased turbidity of water resulting from sedimentation flows from upstream deforestation (for instance in Nagaland, India) (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). An additional impact is through illegal fishing practices within the species range, including poison fishing, dynamite fishing etc. (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). Males move extensively around the river system and are impacted/lost more readily, this can reduce the fertility of the number of eggs laid by the females within the protected areas (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018).","The Chindwin subpopulation of <em>Batagur trivittata</em> is estimated to comprise fewer than 10 adult females at the time of assessment. Persistence of the species was recorded for the Doke-tha-wady (tributary of the middle Ayeyarwady) in 2004, but the river section concerned has been dammed since then and follow-up surveys have failed to locate animals and there is no anecdotal indications of their continuing survival.&#160;A few adults are maintained in captivity in Mandalay. This represents a major total population reduction compared to the last available data from 1900 and 1935, when the species was still widespread and relatively abundant throughout its original range, with nesting aggregations of dozens to thousands of animals having been reported (Maxwell 1911, Theobald 1968,&#160;Smith 1931).",Decreasing,"Historically, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Batagur trivittata</span>&#160;occurred throughout the Ayeyarwady-Chindwin system, as well as the Sittaung and lower Thanlwin (Salween) Rivers of Myanmar.

It occurs at elevations of about 150 to 200 m above seal level.","Egg collection of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Batagur trivittata</span> was historically intensive, and was considered a potential factor in its decline as early as 1900 (Maxwell 1911).

The population trend is difficult to determine but it appears to be declining, however the population is not believed to be decreasing sufficiently rapidly to approach the thresholds under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is fully migratory, and is likely to migrate without stopping on a broad front between breeding and non-breeding areas (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996). Migratory flocks form after the end of breeding between mid-June and early-August, and arrive in the wintering grounds between mid-July and November (adults and immature birds arriving before juveniles) (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996). Those birds wintering in South-East Asia start moving northwards to the breeding grounds in late-February (the migration peaking in March to early-April), arriving from mid-March to May; whereas those wintering in East Africa and southern Asia depart for breeding grounds from mid-April to early-May (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996). Most non-adult wintering birds remain in the wintering areas during the breeding season (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996). The species is typically gregarious, feeding in flocks of 2-50, and sometimes congregating in groups of up to 1,000 when roosting (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season, this species is predominantly found in open, dry, treeless, uncultivated areas up to 3,000 m, including dried mud, silt and clay flats, hard salt-pans overgrown with halophytic plants, and rocky plains near mountains in desert or semi-desert (Johnsgard 1981, Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). In Turkey the species frequents heavily grazed saline steppe (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996). The species usually breeds near water, but exceptionally it will nest up to 20 km away from it (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong> </strong><em>Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season, the species shows a preference for littoral habitats with mixed sand and mud substrata (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is found on sheltered sandy, shelly or muddy beaches, large intertidal mudflats, sandbanks, salt-marshes, estuaries, coral reefs, rocky islands, tidal lagoons and dunes near the coast, although it may sometimes feed on coastal grasslands (Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). Whilst on migration the species will occasionally utilise inland habitats such as salt-lakes and brackish swamps, usually roosting on sandbanks and spits (Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong> This species is carnivorous: during the breeding season its diet consists mainly of terrestrial insects and their larvae (especially beetles, termites, midges and ants), and occasionally lizards; whereas during the non-breeding season its diet contains mainly marine invertebrates such as molluscs (snails), worms and crustaceans (such as shrimps and crabs) (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground amongst sand-hills, gravel, or on other barren substrates (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996). <strong></strong>","In some parts of its breeding range this species is threatened by the destruction of wetlands and bordering fallow steppe through drainage and water extraction for irrigation (Turkey) (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is threatened by habitat degradation and loss throughout its non-breeding range: in Australia agricultural developments are reducing the area of coastal and inland habitat, and hydrological changes to estuaries are modifying important intertidal areas (National Parks and Wildlife Service 1999); key wetland sites in southern Africa (for example Walvis Bay, Namibia) are being degraded through wetland reclamation for suburb and port development, and changes in the flood regime due to road building (Wearne and Underhill 2005).&#160;Favoured migration staging posts, such as the Çukurova delta in southern Turkey are under increasing pressure from hunting, tourism and industrial activities and are often polluted along the coast with oil (Tucker and Heath 1994).&#160;One of the species's migratory staging areas in China (Chongming Island) is undergoing significant habitat loss and degradation through conversion to aquaculture ponds, farmlands and vegetable gardens, the cultivation of the alien plant <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> on tidal flats (promoting rapid sedimentation with the intention of reclaiming the area), and the Three Gorges Dam on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River reducing the supply of river-borne sediment to mudflats in the area (Ma <em>et al.</em> 2002). The species is also susceptible to disturbance from tourists in its non-breeding range (National Parks and Wildlife Service 1999, Wearne and Underhill 2005), and commercial hunting (for sale at market or to restaurants) is a major threat in the area of Chongming Island, China (Ma <em>et al.</em> 2002).","The global   population is estimated to number c.150,000-340,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2016). This roughly equates to 100,000-225,000 mature individuals. National population sizes have been estimated at   &lt; 10,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals   in China; and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering   individuals in Taiwan (Brazil 2009).&#160;The European population is estimated at 600-1,000 pairs, which equates to 1,200-2,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>CMS Appendix II.

It is now absent or occurs in extremely reduced numbers over the majority of its former breeding and wintering grounds and is common nowhere. It is thought that wetland destruction and over-harvesting of both birds and eggs are the key reasons for its decline.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><br/><p></p>","It breeds around lakes&#160;and other freshwater habitats (including artificial habitats such as fishponds)&#160;with rich aquatic vegetation, typically but not exclusively in dense grass or flooded tussock/shrubby meadows. In Liaoning, China, it is usually found in coastal wetlands with dense vegetation, or potentially on rivers and ponds surrounded by forest. The nest is built on a tussock or under shrubs, sometimes floating, and occasionally amongst branches. In winter, it occurs on freshwater lakes and reservoirs.<p></p>","<p>Little quantified data exists on the causes of decline of Baer’s Pochard. However, the principal threats are thought to be habitat loss and degradation, particularly from drainage and rice cultivation, and unsustainable exploitation for food, both of fledged birds and eggs (R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016). It seems likely that the long-term decline was caused predominantly by habitat loss, and the apparent recent exacerbation of the decline is due to over-harvesting of what had already become a small and localised population (R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016).</p><p>Hearn (2015b) assessed threats the species to include habitat loss and degradation, unsustainable harvesting, disturbance and recreation, bycatch in fishing nets, hybridisation, and pesticides and fertilisers.</p><p>Habitat loss and degradation is probably greatest in the breeding areas, particularly in China north of Beijing where extensive wetland loss has occurred since the 1950s primarily as a result of agricultural development. For instance in Heilongjiang, wetland loss for farming (predominantly rice production) has exceeded 70% in some areas (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2005) and a similar pattern has occurred elsewhere in northeast China, e.g. in the Songnen Plain, Jilin Province (Wang<em> et al.</em> 2011). Recently discovered breeding sites at fishponds in the Yangtze floodplain are under threat from changes in use and drainage, e.g. at Huangpi (near Wuhan, Hubei) around half of the habitat used by breeding Baer’s Pochard in 2014 was lost before the 2015 breeding season (Hearn 2015a, Lu <em>et al.</em> 2015). Wintering sites are also under threat from habitat loss and degradation. Large-scale habitat alteration has taken place in the Yangtze floodplain due to conversion of wetlands for agriculture, resulting in a large area of natural wetland being lost, estimated to be 62% between the 1950s and the 1980s. Candaba Swamp in the Philippines where the species has been recorded in winter as a vagrant is under imminent threat of land conversion (Roberts 2015).</p><p>Unsustainable harvesting, both trapping and poisoning of birds and the collection of eggs, is a major threat faced by many Asian waterbirds. The traditional harvesting of wild animals, including birds, has increased dramatically in the past decade, and is now a major cause of decline for some wild fauna, probably including some waterbird species. Although the scale of this is currently hard to quantify for Baer’s Pochard (as no wide-ranging quantitative assessments have been undertaken), it could be significant, particularly in China where illegal poisoning and trapping of waterbirds is widespread, indiscriminate (MaMing <em>et al.</em> 2012) and continuing to worsen (MaMing&#160;<em>per </em>R. Hearn <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016), and the scale of egg collection, whilst unknown, is also probably widespread and highly organised and is also thought to be concentrated in northeast China, within the breeding range of Baer’s Pochard (MaMing&#160;<em>per </em>R. Hearn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Incidents of the use of poisoned baits have also been recorded at wintering locations for Baer's Pochard in Bangladesh which have the potential to cause significant mortality from a single incident (Chowdhury <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/>Additionally, in several cases, the loss of populations from former important areas have been preceded by low water levels or complete drying up of water bodies (e.g. the loss of the breeding population at Xianghai Reserve and the wintering population at Baiquan wetlands in Wuhan [J. Hornskov<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2005, S. Chowdhury<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2010, W. Xin, C. Lei, L. Jinyu and T. Fox <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012]). Development for tourism and recreational watersports pose a threat to the species's habitat (Townshend 2014), particularly&#160;at Hengshui Hu, Henan, China (one of the most important known breeding sites) (R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Incidents of hunting by the use of poisoned baits have been recorded at wintering locations for Baer's Pochard in Bangladesh. which have the potential to cause significant mortality from a single incident (Chowdhury<em> et al.</em> 2012). Hybridisation with Ferruginous Duck, <em>Aythya nyroca</em>,&#160;is also a potential threat (N. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2014, R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;</p><p></p>","Wang <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2012) stated that the global population is likely less than 1,000  individuals and could be much less than this, and so it is placed in the band 250-999 individuals, equating to 167-666 mature individuals, rounded here to 150-700 mature individuals, which now potentially can be considered to be in one sub-populations (R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><span class=""says"">",Decreasing,"The species&#160;breeds from the Amur and Ussuri basins in <strong>Russia</strong>&#160;southwards to the central and lower Yangtze floodplain in central-eastern&#160;<strong>China</strong>.

However, some breeding sites in this region are likely to remain unknown as winter counts of the population are larger than the number of birds that can currently be accounted for during the breeding season (Hearn 2015a).&#160;A few observations support this assertion, including 52 reported at Xingkai Lake (Lake Khanka) in March 2014 (T. Townshend <em>per</em>&#160;R. Hearn <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;In neighbouring Russia&#160;there are also no confirmed breeding records in recent years, though it is suspected from at least two sites; Khasan wetlands (Solovyeva&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013 <em>per </em>&#160;R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016) and Muraviovka Park (Heim&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;South of Beijing, several important breeding sites have been discovered since 2012. The most important is in Hebei Province (Townshend 2014)&#160;where 20-30 birds are seen annually in spring (R. Hearn <em>in litt. </em>2016) and larger post-breeding flocks of up to 65 individuals (August 2014) (T. Townshend&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014).&#160;Two breeding sites as far south as the Yangtze floodplain were discovered in 2014 and 2016; one in Hubei (Lu <em>et al.</em> 2015) and another in Jiangxi (L. Wu <em>per </em>R. Hearn <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;One female bird was recorded over a period of several weeks at Muraviovka Park, Russia in July 2013 but direct evidence of breeding or nesting was not found and the area flooded soon afterwards (Heim&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Other possible breeding sites have been located&#160;in Shandong Province, China (N. Moores&#160;<em>in litt.</em> 2014) and Henan Province (X. Tao <em>per </em>R. Hearn <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Two individuals observed over winter 2012–2013 in China and South Korea were likely to have been first winter birds (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>A drastic decline and range contraction has also occurred in the species's wintering range, with the species ceasing to winter in regular numbers at any site  outside of mainland China as of winter 2010/11.&#160;Within China, the species has declined rapidly too (in the middle and lower Yangtze floodplain counts reduced 99% between 1986-93 and 2010-11 [Wang <em>et al. </em>2017]), and site use is sporadic. Recent peak winter counts have come from several locations, and none in more than a single year. In 2014/15, a peak count of 84 was recorded at Tai Bai Hu, Shandong Province (S.

Other large counts include 68 at Chong Hu, Hubei Province, in January 2015 and 40 at Chenyao Hu, Anhui Province, in February 2014.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It departs its breeding grounds from late-July to September (southward movements continuing into November) and returns from late-May to June (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It breeds from May to August in solitary well-dispersed pairs and forages alone or in small loose flocks of up to 30 individuals (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It is gregarious during the winter however, often roosting in large flocks containing up to several thousand individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species nests in the high Arctic in both upland and valley locations between the treeline and the coast, utilising dry stony tundra with sedge, moss, lichen, grass or dwarf birch, peat ridges in tundra marshes, dry exposed ridges, riverbanks, raised sand or gravel beaches, and rocky slopes (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species frequents intertidal mudflats, saltmarshes, sandflats and beaches of oceanic coastlines, bays and estuaries (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). During migration it may also be found inland on lakes, pools or grasslands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season the diet of this species consists largely of adult and larval insects such as beetles and Diptera as well as some plant matter (e.g. grass seeds and stems) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> When on the coast in its wintering range the species takes marine polychaete worms, molluscs and crustaceans (e.g. crabs, sand shrimps), occasionally also taking insects (e.g. grasshoppers and beetles) or earthworms when in inland habitats on passage (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow scrape on dry ground in exposed, stony sites, neighbouring nests not less than 400 m apart (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information</strong> In the UK there is evidence that the removal of Common Cordgrass (<em>Spartina anglica</em>) from tidal mudflats using a herbicide is beneficial for the species (Evans 1986).","The following information refers to the species's European range only: Populations fluctuate from year to year with poor weather and predator pressure in years of low lemming numbers (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Warmer temperatures brought about by climate change are thought to affect this species (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is also threatened by disturbance from recreational activities (Cutts <em>et al</em>. 2009), intertidal oyster culture (Gittings and O'Donoghue 2012) and urban and industrial development.","The global population is estimated at 738,000-935,000 (Wetlands International 2015). This roughly equates to 490,000-630,000 mature individuals. National population estimates include 10,000 individuals on migration and 1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in China, 50-10,000 wintering individuals in Taiwan (China), 1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and 1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Korea, 1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and 1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Japan, and 10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and 1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).&#160;The European population is estimated at 5,000-10,000 pairs, which equates to 10,000-20,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The species is listed on Annex II (B) of the EU Birds Directive.

154738156,22693452,Calidris pygmaea,Critically Endangered,A2abcd; C1+2a(ii),2021,2021-06-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Critically Endangered because it has an extremely small population, with a lower bound that is thought to now fall below 250 mature individuals in a single population, that is undergoing a rapid continuing decline in excess of 25% in one generation (with a current estimated 8% annual reduction), and has suffered an extremely rapid population reduction in the previous three generations. The current rate of decline is thought to represent a minor improvement on that over the past three generations but remains very rapid and it still qualifies at the level of Endangered based on the estimated/projected current and future three-generation rate of population reduction. A number of factors are driving the decline, including habitat loss in its breeding, passage and wintering grounds, compounded by disturbance, pollution, and the effects of climate change, however the impact of indiscriminate shorebird hunting appears to be the most immediate and severe threat. Juvenile recruitment has, until recently, been very low, leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly. Extensive conservation work has likely driven the slowing rate of decline, but much more work is required to prevent the extinction of this species.<p></p>  <p></p>","The species has a very specialised breeding habitat, using only lagoon spits with crowberry-lichen vegetation or dwarf birch and willow sedges near lakes and marshes, together with adjacent estuary and mudflat habitats that are used as feeding sites by adults during nesting. It may also use stream-deposited gravel pits (Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species has never been recorded breeding further than 5 km (and exceptionally once 7 km) from the sea shore. Breeding birds are very site-faithful. It breeds either in single pairs or loose aggregations (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. It nests in June-July (Tomkovich 1992, 1995,&#160;Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2020), with failed breeders potentially leaving on migration before others (Zhang Lin 2016). During winter, it prefers mixed sandy tidal mudflats with an uneven surface and very shallow water, mainly in the outermost parts of river deltas and outer islands, often with a higher sand content and thin mud layer on top. In the areas with total coastal conversion, it favours certain stages in the management of saltpans (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The species uses a&#160;variety of feeding techniques that includes a larger variety of food items across the range, including terrestrial insects, small seeds, larvae of beetles and small aquatic amphipods (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2018, Van Gils&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Evidence to support suspicions that immature birds spend their first summer on the wintering grounds until their second year come from ringing recoveries (Tomkovich 1995, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2010a), photographs of a  second calendar-year bird in Thailand in July 2010 (G. Chutima<em> in litt</em>. 2010) and another individual in Bangladesh in June 2015 (S. U. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016),&#160;as well as oversummering and passage birds in the Rudong mudflats (Clark&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Zhang&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;<p></p><p></p>","Throughout its migratory and wintering ranges, tidal flats are being reclaimed for coastal development (industry, leisure, infrastructure, aquaculture and agriculture) and are becoming increasingly polluted. The important staging area at Saemangeum and Geum estuary, South Korea, including the Mangyeung and Tongjin estuaries, has already been reclaimed, and remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2008). Since the reclamation at Saemangeum in 2007, only an average of a single individual has been recorded, in contrast to 'hundreds' prior to the development (Lee <em>et al. </em>2018). Plans for a large-scale reclamation project on the Tiaozini Sandbanks, (part of the Rudong mudflats) were feared to threatened over 60,000 ha of mudflats used by the species by 2020 (Moores 2015,&#160;J. Li and M. Tong to C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017), and elsewhere at Rudong new seawalls were being built in 2015 (Zöckler 2015, Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). However, the national announcement of an end to the reclamation of intertidal land in January 2018 (Anon. 2018, Lei 2018) appears to be a dramatic shift towards alleviating new impacts from this threat and these sites are included in the World Heritage Site nomination.<br/><br/>Smooth Cord-grass&#160;<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>&#160;is an invasive plant used to stabilise mudflats to assist in reclamation along the Chinese coast and rapidly leaves intertidal areas unsuitable for Spoon-billed Sandpipers, dramatically reducing habitat availability (Menxiu <em>et al. </em>2012, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017). At both Rudong and Dongling, <em>Spartina </em><em>alterniflora</em> has formed dense stands with considerable spread noted between spring 2014 and autumn 2015 (Peng <em>et al. </em>2017), and it has also been found on Leizhou mudflat (V. Fu&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2017). The Rudong mudflats are also&#160;the site for development of the largest wind farm in Asia, which could prove to be another threat to this species (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007, 2009, 2010, Li <em>et al. </em>undated)<strong></strong>.&#160;Plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia and cross-dams along the coast of Bangladesh continue to pose threats (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010a, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2011, Zöckler 2015); however, this plan is currently on hold and plans to protect the area have been developed (Zöckler&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009,&#160;<strong></strong>Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009,&#160;Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010b, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler<em> in litt. </em>2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b, Martinez &amp; Lewthaithe 2013)<strong></strong>, and this may be a particularly serious threat to birds wintering on Nan Thar Island and in the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b). A survey of hunting activities in five villages around Sonadia Island, Bangladesh, in September 2010 found that of the 53 hunters interviewed, eight of them claimed to have caught a total of 22 Spoon-billed Sandpipers between October 2009 and April 2010 (Chowdhury 2010). Hunting in the species's non-breeding range could be a crucial factor in the poor rate of recruitment into the breeding population, as immature birds do not return to the breeding areas until they are two years old and thus are more exposed to capture (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b)<strong></strong>. However, recent conservation action aimed at reducing trapping on the wintering grounds appears to have been successful (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014) and may have reduced this significant source of mortality (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016, Aung <em>et al</em>. 2016/2017).&#160;Large-scale wader trapping was observed at Fucheng, south-west Guangdong province, China, where four Spoon-billed Sandpiper were observed in December 2012 (BirdLife Asia 2013), but surveys for the species in south China in January 2017 did not find any illegal mist nets (V. Fu <em>in litt. </em>2017). Monofilament fishing nets set over high tides were found to be a serious problem on the central Chinese coast, with multiple parallel lines of nets set at Tiaozini&#160;in autumn 2015 were found to have captured scores of birds after just one nocturnal high tide, including one juvenile Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Peng <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;Hunting with nets has also been reported from Viet Nam (Long 2015). Recently the scale of hunting in the Russian far northeast has been found to be much greater than previously assumed, and may impact the species during the immediate post-breeding period particularly.<br/><br/>Between August and October 2014, more than a thousand dead wading birds, including two Spoon-billed Sandpipers, were found on the Tiaozini Sandbanks (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017). Tests are ongoing to understand the cause of mortality; however, poisoned bait was discovered in the area.<br/><br/>There are no immediate threats to the breeding grounds, but nests in the vicinity of villages are sometimes destroyed by dogs (<strong></strong>E. Syroechkovskiy <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Poor breeding productivity in recent years has been attributed to heavy nest predation and bad weather (Syroechkovskiy<em> et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>. Significant habitat degradation has been observed in 5 of 30 visited breeding locations (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010)<strong></strong>. Human disturbance, both by residents and researchers, may cause increased levels of nest desertion and predation by foxes and skuas (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Shorebirds, including this species, are also occasionally killed by children with slingshots (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>; one male was also shot by a Russian hunter near the Chinese border in 2008 (Zöckler &amp; Syroechkovskiy 2008)<strong></strong>. Small but significant numbers of birds and their eggs have been collected for scientific purposes in the last 20 years, with one small colony completely wiped out due to this activity (Syroechkovsky 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and other species dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 57% of the breeding habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler &amp; Lysenko 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;Recent observation on the breeding grounds unfortunately confirm a worrying trend of increasing bushes intruding on the coastal tundra habitats in the southern range, as well as drying of the tundra in the northern range with significant&#160;consequences on food access for breeding waders (C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020)<p></p><p></p>","A total of ten repeats of a Lincoln-Peterson method to estimate the global population have resulted in a weighted mean single global estimate of 490 mature individuals (95% confidence limits 360-620) for the six-year period between 2014-2019 (Green <em>et al. </em>2021). However, the most recent winter counts suggest a total number of birds in the order of 330-340 individuals (Zöckler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021), indicating that the total of mature individuals may actually already have fallen below 250 if we assume fewer than three-quarters of these are mature individuals. As such the population is placed within a custom band of 240-620 mature individuals, with a best single value of 490 (Green <em>et al. </em>2021) but noting that this figure may already be outdated.<br/><br/>The trend of these estimates, albeit over a short-time frame, was a mean rate of reduction of 8% (Green <em>et al. </em>2021), similar to the 9% estimated from surveys of the most important wintering population in Myanmar (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010a). However, the confidence interval of the more recent trend estimates overlapped zero, such that there is low confidence in the accuracy of the trend magnitude. In the absence of better information, and noting the congruence with the rate of reduction estimated from wintering surveys, this rate of decline is taken to be the best estimate for the population as a whole for the current timeframe. This rate of reduction is equivalent (using an exponential model of decline) to a three-generation reduction of 68% (over 13.4 years), estimated as a rate of continuing decline of 31.5% in one generation (4.5 years) and 52.7% in two generations (9 years). However, prior to 2009 the rate of population reduction, based on counts of breeding pairs at surveyed locations, was reported to be extremely rapid at an annual rate of 26% between 2002-2008 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010a). As such, the past rate of reduction for the most recent three-generation period (2007-2021) is suspected to have been at a higher rate, and, given the uncertainty, is placed in a band of 70-80%.",Decreasing,"This species has a naturally limited breeding range on the Chukotsk peninsula and southwards to the isthmus of the Kamchatka peninsula, in north-eastern <strong>Russia </strong>(BirdLife International 2001,&#160;Zoeckler &amp; Lappo 2008). It migrates down the western Pacific coast through Russia, <strong>Japan</strong>, <strong>North Korea</strong>, <strong>South Korea</strong>, mainland <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Hong Kong</strong> (China), <strong>Taiwan</strong> (China) and <strong>Viet Nam,</strong> to its main wintering grounds in southern China, Viet Nam, <strong>Thailand</strong>,&#160;<strong>Bangladesh </strong>and <strong>Myanmar </strong>(Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is a vagrant visitor in <strong>Cambodia </strong>and <strong>Indonesia </strong>(during non-breeding seasons here particularly; C.&#160;Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Wintering birds have also been recorded from <strong>India </strong>(with a recent sighting in 2018 possibly the first for 14 years [Roy 2018]), <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, the Fujian province in China (the Min Jiang estuary in Fujian has recently been identified as an important wintering site for the species [F. Cheung <em>in litt. </em>2010, Bai <em>et al</em>. 2015,&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016]), Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China&#160;((Martinez &amp; Lewthwaite 2013,&#160;Fu 2015), and peninsular&#160;<strong>Malaysia</strong>. It occurs regularly at only a few sites within this wintering range, with important sites in Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and China. Sonadia Island and Meghna Estuary (Bangladesh), the Gulf of Martaban and Nan Thar (Myanmar) were believed to support over half of the wintering population (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2018); over 80% of the entire population were considered to winter in Myanmar and Bangladesh (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). However, recent surveys show that the Southern China coast in Guandong and Guanxi Provinces also host significant numbers (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016) and that the numbers in Bangladesh and Myanmar are falling more rapidly than at sites further north along the migratory route (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). It seems likely that the bulk of the population now winters along the Chinese coast.<br/><br/>Records of wintering birds in&#160;Myanmar are of 84 individuals in 2008, 73 in January 2009, and 89 in 2010 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>; 150-220 in the Bay of Martaban in 2010-2012&#160;<strong style=""FONT-WEIGHT: normal"">(</strong>Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2014) and approximately 155 in the upper bay of Martaban in January 2015 (Clark 2015). In 2016, an estimated 100-112 individuals were present in the upper Gulf of Mottama, Myanmar (Aung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, 2020), a reduction from 244 individuals observed in 2009 (Aung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Recent counts reinforce this rapid reduction, with only 47 individuals counted in January 2021 despite high coverage (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>In March-April 2010, a minimum total of 49 individuals were recorded during targeted surveys along the coast of Bangladesh (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2011)<strong></strong>. A new site along the Meghna Estuary was discovered in 2015, which supported a minimum of 48 individuals in February 2016 (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Surveys along the Bangladesh coast from December 2015 to February 2016 found a record number of a minimum of 76 individuals from different sites along the coast, the highest numbers recorded since 1989 in Bangladesh (Chowdhury 2016). However since 2016 numbers located in Bangladesh in winter have fallen rapidly, with fewer than ten counted in January 2021 (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>During the winter of 2015-2016, it was estimated that 10 adults used the Gulf of Thailand (K. Sutasha <em>in litt</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>China Coastal Waterbird Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2013 (Bai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) identified the following sites as of international importance for the species: Yalu Jliang estuarine wetland (Liaoning), Rudong coast (Jiangsu), Dongtai coast (Jiangsu), Dongling coast (Jiangsu), Minjiang Estuary National Nature Reserve (Fujian), Dadeng Island and Weitou Bay (Fujian) and Xitou coast (Guangdong).&#160;<br/><br/>A total of 61 individuals was recorded wintering in southern China (present at ten of 36 surveyed sites) in the January 2021 coordinated surveys (Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance&#160;2021). The Leizhou Peninsula has been identified as an important area, holding about 50 birds (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016, C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2016): 33 were counted in January 2021&#160;(Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance&#160;2021).<br/>&#160;<br/>China is of primary importance during post-breeding and migration periods. It is likely that a large proportion of the adult population of the species spends time at Rudong, China, in both autumn and spring (Menxiu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is currently the only known moulting site for the species (Bai <em>et al</em>. 2015, Peng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Counts of up to 103 individuals at Rudong in October 2011, 106 in October 2012, 140 in October 2013 (Zöckler and Li 2013), a minimum of 226 in September 2014 and 177-190 in October 2014 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2015) are likely to have accounted for a substantial proportion of the global population (M. Tong <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). A maximum of 100 birds were recorded on the Tiaozini mudflats (part of the Rudong mudflats), Dongtai County, in October 2014 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2015), with more than 100 birds recorded at Tiaozini in October 2015 (Li and Chowdhury 2016). A survey in May 2015 on the Rudong mudflats recorded at least 62 individuals, including a number of head-started birds (Phillips 2015). Modelling work has shown Rudong to be too far for the species to reach in a single flight from its breeding grounds and work is underway to identify another stopover site in the Russian Far East (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Due to its specialised breeding habitat requirements, it was probably always a scarce species, but numbers dropped rapidly, at least between 2000 and 2010 (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Surveys on the breeding grounds revealed a dramatic decline from 2,000-2,800 pairs in the 1970s (which assumes equal distribution of the species and may have potentially excluded unknown sites; C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2019) to fewer than 1,000 pairs in 2000, 402-572 pairs in 2003, 350-380 pairs in 2005 (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong> and not more than 150-320 pairs in 2008. The breeding population in 2009-2010 was optimistically estimated at 120-200 pairs (<strong></strong>Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a<strong></strong>)<strong></strong> in an estimated total population of 500-800 individuals, perhaps indicating an 88% decline since 2002, equating to an annual rate of decline of 26%<strong></strong><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""> </span>(Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a)<strong></strong>. These declines have taken place across all known breeding sites, and it is unlikely that significant colonies remain undiscovered (<strong></strong>Zöckler 2005, <strong></strong>Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Declines were also observed at wintering grounds. For example, no birds were sighted wintering in Viet Nam in 2009 at a site that supported at least 27 birds in the mid 1990s (E. Syroechkovskiy <em>et al. in litt.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. However, over the last few years (2013-2015), there are signs that active conservation interventions may have stemmed this rapid population decline and the small remaining population appears decline at a slower pace of still 8-10% (Aung <em>et al</em>. 2018,&#160;Aung <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Breeding success is quite low: average productivity was 0.66 young fledged per nest in 2005, and much lower in 2007, and this is compounded by a very low rate of juveniles and adults returning to the breeding grounds. Until recently, the species has had an ageing and rapidly declining population with little recruitment (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2010). For example, data collected on birds at one breeding area from 2003 to 2009 suggest that recruitment into the adult breeding population was effectively zero in all years apart from 2005 and 2007 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a)<strong></strong>. In 2013, for the first time there was no decline detected at the core breeding area of Meinypylgino, where the population was stable at c.10 pairs (Zöckler 2013). In June 2014, an expedition to Russkaya Koshka recorded an increase in the number of breeding territories recovering from a low of 1-2 pairs in previous years (Nitschke <em>et al</em>. 2015), but numbers are still not near levels known from the early 2000s (Tomkovich <em>et al.</em> 2002, C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In July 2011 and 2016, an expedition in Kamchatka located each a previously unknown breeding area for the species (Heritage Expeditions 2016), with around 3 pairs each.&#160;<em></em><p></p>","Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C.

Trapping using monofilament nets is also frequent on the Chinese coast during migration periods and Spoon-billed Sandpipers have been observed being caught (Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I and II. The species has been added to the list as a Class 1 protected species on the National Key Protected Wild Animal List of China: it is forbidden to hunt, capture, kill, sell, acquire and use the species (Choi 2021).  Fourteen sites along the coast of Bohai Gulf and the Yellow Sea in China have been nominated for World Heritage Site status. Protected areas in its breeding, staging and wintering areas include Moroshechnaya and several local wildlife refuges on the Chukotsk peninsula (Russia), Yancheng and Chongming Dongtan (China), Mai Po (Hong Kong), Lanyang estuary (Taiwan, China), Point Calimere and Chilka lake (India), and Xuan Thuy Nature Reserve (Vietnam). In September 2019 the Bird Conservation Society of Thailand completed the purchase of 8 hectares to conserve habitat at Pak Thale, within the Pak Thale-Laem Phak Bia Flyway Network site recognised by the Government of Thailand (Jearwattanakanok &amp; Yong 2019). The Gulf of Mottama (160,000 ha), Myanmar has also been proposed as a Ramsar site and the area belonging to Mon State is soon to be designated (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zöckler 2015). This work across the Gulf of Mottama headed by the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Task Force, with support from the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Rainforest Trust, also ensure sustainable development in line with conservation goals (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is also legally protected under the Wildlife Act of Myanmar, however the law lacks full implementation (Aung <em>et al</em>. 2020). In 2019, the main stop over sites in Tiaozini (Rudong) were also included into the World Heritage Site nomination (C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Hunters within the area have also signed agreements to surrender trapping equipment and engage in alternate livelihoods (Ceci 2017). Work by the group 'SBS in China' recently lead to the local government designating a 10,000 ha area for Spoon-billed Sandpipers in Rudong (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Chinese government have additionally declared a moratorium for future coastal development (P. Insua-Cao <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Shellfish protected areas have also been designated, which will provide suitable feeding habitat for birds and protect local livelihoods. <br/><br/>Annual surveys of breeding sites on Chukotka are undertaken and over 450 adults and young have been ringed on the breeding grounds since 2000 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Annual searches of potential new breeding sites have taken place from 2011 to at least 2013 (Zöckler 2013).&#160;Recent advances on the protection of important site for the species have additionally accelerated. In Myanmar, 2 further Ramsar sites protects the species in&#160;the the Ayeyarwady Delta (50,000 ha) and Nan Thar Island (40,000), with a vast increase in the official protection level, including preparations for the last remaining site in the south of the country to be protected (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). &#160;Since 2018, the government of Chukotka is also supporting the development of a 300,000 ha large protected area that is adequately named the Land of the Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Syroechkovsky 2019).<br/> <br/>A range of awareness and outreach programmes have taken place. Local support groups have been established in some breeding areas and negotiations have taken place to reduce short-term hunting pressure at one of the key wintering sites in Myanmar (Zöckler &amp; Htin Hla 2009, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>. Researchers and a local environmentalist group convinced two villages on Nan Thar Island, Myanmar, to agree to a hunting ban of the species, with a view to develop an ecologically and economically sound alternative in the future (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>. The development of ecotourism at Nan Thar generated extra income for local people and encouraged them to protect the birds (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Bay of Martaban, socio-economic surveys carried out in early 2010 indicated that bird-hunting is undesirable and that most hunters would readily switch to alternative livelihoods if assisted<strong></strong> (BANCA 2010)<strong></strong>. These surveys were swiftly followed by mitigation activities in the same year, in which hunters agreed to stop their activities in exchange for equipment to provide them with an alternative income source, and awareness-raising events and materials were provided for whole communities (BANCA<em> in litt</em>. 2010)<strong></strong>. On the eastern shore of the Gulf of Martaban, 9 out of 15 hunters targeted by the mitigation activities had increased their livelihood status, the remaining six had neither increased nor decreased their livelihood status (BANCA 2012). Conservationists in Bangladesh successfully raised funds to provide hunters with loans so that they could establish new livelihoods, such as farming (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The Bangladesh Spoon-billed Sandpiper Conservation Project conducted a one year awareness-raising project on Sonadia Island, an important wintering site for the species (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). Activities involved former hunters visiting schools to talk about conservation work, film showings, boat races, mural painting and photography exhibitions (S. U. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;In 2011, awareness-raising and advocacy activities including two training workshops took place in schools in China. Schoolchildren living close to the species's breeding grounds in Russia have also been taught about the species and sent letters to other schoolchildren living along the flyway asking them to protect the species (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>A Species Action Plan was produced in 2006 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2008), and updated in 2008 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong> and 2010 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b)<strong></strong>. At the fifth meeting of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership in Cambodia in December 2010, the partners agreed to establish a Task Force for this species, charged with implementing the action plan (Fowlie 2011).&#160;In 2012, the 'Saving Spoony's Chinese Wetlands' project came top in a vote organised by the Disney Foundation, winning $100,000 to support conservation efforts for the species (Clark&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Headstarting, or artificial incubation and captive rearing on the breeding grounds, avoids the high levels of natural predation that occur at egg and chick stage. This significantly increased breeding success, with the number of wild birds fledged increasing by approximately five times per pair (D. Pain&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). In addition, by taking eggs within days of them being laid early in the season, some birds lay a second clutch that they incubate and raise themselves. Headstarting expeditions in 2012 and 2013 have resulted in the release of a total of 25 juveniles from 35 eggs collected (Zöckler 2013). In 2015, 37 eggs were collected for headstarting in Chukotka, of which 35 were fertile (B. Hughes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015). In July 2016, the headstarting programme successfully released 30 fledglings, the most birds released in a single year. 22 chicks from 30 eggs survived to fledging in 2020, but despite continued releases the number of headstarted birds appears to have ceased offsetting the decline at the release site in 2019 (Syroechkovskiy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).<br/><br/>A&#160;captive-rearing and breeding programme started in 2011, when eggs were collected in Chukotka, and the young birds reared in captivity in Russia were subsequently transported to purpose-built conservation breeding facilities at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust headquarters at Slimbridge,<strong> </strong>UK (Pain 2010)<strong></strong>. In 2012, eggs were transported from Chukotka direct to Slimbridge (Pain <em>et al</em>. 2011, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2013). In May 2014 the captive population numbered 25 birds (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). Two pairs of captive birds at Slimbridge started to breed in 2016 (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016). One chick fledged in 2018 but unfortunately died shortly after, but two chicks were successfully reared fledging in 2019 and remain alive in 2021. No further successful breeding has occurred, and in 2020 several of the eight and nine year-old founders of the captive population died, possibly due at least in part to age (Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust 2021).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to develop captive breeding programmes and continue to monitor numbers at known breeding sites and carry out searches of suitable habitat in north Kamchatka. Continue to survey wintering sites to monitor the population and identify key sites in the East Asian Flyway to help ensure their protection. Campaign against the continued reclamation of intertidal mudflats along the entire migration route. Restore reclaimed wetland sites.&#160;Continue to search for stopover sites in the Russian Far East (Clark&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Actively prevent collection of eggs and birds for scientific purposes, museums and private collections. Take measures to ensure that researcher activity does not increase mortality. Ensure effective legal protection of all known breeding sites. Survey existing and potential wintering sites in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Stop hunting and trapping at key sites in Myanmar, Bangladesh and Russia. Ensure awareness-raising activities are maintained in the long-term. Ensure protection of newly discovered sites and existing sites, especially in South Korea. Legally protect it in all range states. Identify and mitigate pressures at breeding grounds. Lobby against plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia, Bangladesh (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury 2012) and protect important sites along the Meghna Estuary, Bangladesh (Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Pursue protected area status for the Bay of Martaban and other coastal sites in Myanmar (BANCA<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2014).

Whilst the population displays a small decreasing trend, the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The South Island Oystercatcher predominantly occurs in coastal and freshwater wetland environments but has been known to utilise anthropogenically-modified environments including farmland and pastures (Robertson <em>et al</em>. 2007). During the non-breeding season, <em>Haematopus finschi</em> occurs predominantly on sandy, muddy and gravel intertidal mudflats and beaches throughout the estuaries, harbours and coastlines of the North Island (Marchant &amp; Higgins 1993) however, high tides and or bad weather can force individuals to seek safer sites in neighbouring grassy paddocks and farmland (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). During the breeding season, South Island Oystercatchers utilise inland gravel-bed rivers, gravel beaches of lakes and farmland, often moving to higher elevations to breed above the tree-line in subalpine tundra and wetlands (Marchant &amp; Higgins 1993, Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014).","Human populations have generated a significant and diverse array of threats to <em>Haematopus finschi</em> in New Zealand. The introduction of alien species to the New Zealand islands has resulted in the increased predation of South Island Oystercatchers by invasive mammalian predators, a reduction in food and roosting space availability in wintering areas and an invasion of river bed nesting areas by tall, alien vegetation (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Whilst hunting led to a significant reduction in South Island Oystercatcher populations pre-1940, subsequent protection has removed this threat (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Land use change and urban expansion threaten breeding, roosting and feeding sites, with food availability further reduced by the commercial-scale mechanical harvest of cockles in intertidal areas, such as the Golden and Tasman Bays (Schmechel 2001, Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Pollution of harbour areas poses a further threat to the Southern Oystercatcher, evidenced by lead concentrations being 146% higher in Oystercatchers sampled at the urban Manukau harbour compared to the rural Kaipara harbour (Thompson &amp; Dowding 1999). Large-scale development of wind farms in coastal regions has the potential to increase mortality of Oystercatchers on migration or commuting between roosts and feeding areas (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Climate change presents a further threat, both through the reduction in intertidal area available for the waders to feed brought about by sea level rise and the reduction in prey species density stemming from a change in rainfall intensity patterns (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014).","The population size was estimated to be 112,675 individuals in 1983-94 (Sagar <em>et al</em>. 1999). Numbers are thought to have increased for a few years after this, after which they declined, possibly back to the 1988 level (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). The population is therefore suspected to be c.113,000, roughly equivalent to 75,333 mature individuals, here placed in the band 50,000-99,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The South Island Oystercatcher undergoes annual migration between the North and South Islands of <strong>New Zealand</strong>, the country to which it is endemic (Marchant and Higgins 1993). The majority of the population breed inland on the South Island, mainly east of the Southern Alps, up to 1800 m a.s.l., with small numbers breeding in North Island's Hawkes Bay and southern Wairarapa since the 1980s (Marchant &amp; Higgins, 1993; Robertson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Non-breeding individuals are spread throughout New Zealand's coastal regions with 68% of the non-breeding population found in the northern half of the North Island, predominantly in harbour and estuarine settings (Marchant &amp; Higgins 1993, Robertson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, Sagar &amp; Veitch, 2014).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Oceanian,,false,false,Global

It occurs on plateaus or gentle slopes with montane tundra in the subarctic at heights of 300-1,600 m (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In its wintering range the species occurs in sheltered coastal habitats such as inlets, bays, harbours, estuaries and lagoons with large intertidal mud and sandflats, oceanic sandy beaches with nearby mudflats (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, sandy spits and islets, muddy shorelines with mangroves and occasionally exposed reefs or rock platforms (Higgins and Davies 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It roosts in refuges (Rogers <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong> such as shallow water in sheltered sites, on coastal dunes or on saltflats amongst mangroves (Higgins and Davies 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> during high tides (Rogers <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>.<br/><br/>On passage the species stages in estuaries and on intertidal mudflats (Tomkovich 1997, Moores 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

It breeds from late-May to late-June, departing the breeding grounds in July and arriving on the wintering grounds between August and October (del Hoyo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The return migration to the breeding grounds takes place from March to April (del Hoyo<em>&#160;et al.</em>1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>&#160;although juvenile non-breeders often remain in the tropical parts of the wintering range for the breeding season (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

Up to 65% of intertidal habitat in the Yellow Sea has been lost  over the past 50 years with habitat loss estimated at a rate of &gt;1% annually (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). Losses are attributed to reclamation for agriculture,  aquaculture, and other development and are expected to continue or accelerate owing to population growth around the Yellow Sea. Degradation and loss of wetland habitats in the Yellow Sea region are also attributed to environmental pollution (Kelin and Qiang 2006)<strong></strong> (e.g. oil contamination of intertidal mudflats) (Tomkovich 1997)<strong></strong>, reduced river flows and human disturbance (Kelin and Qiang 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong> (e.g. from off-road vehicles, tourists and hunters) (Tomkovich 1997)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>In South Korea, after the loss of the important Saemangeum stopover area and almost all of the tidal-flats in Asan Bay and much of Namyang bay, possibly only five sites nationwide remain internationally important. Of these, only one (the Geum Estuary) currently has a low risk of reclamation, with the other four at risk due to the construction of tidal power plants and barrages, industrial use and urban expansion (N. Moores <em>in litt.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. Benthic food stocks used by the species reportedly crashed at Yalujiang NNR, Liaoning in 2014 and 2015 (D. Melville <em>in litt</em>. 2015). In 2015, most birds departed Yalujiang and moved to northern Bohai, however, it seems unlikely that this site will exist in five years time, owing to extensive reclamation works (D. Melville <em>in litt</em>. 2015). In the Philippines, India and Australia other threats may include mangrove afforestation, habitat degradation caused by intense fishing activities and harvesting of molluscs and bivalves,&#160;infrastructure projects, aquaculture, oil spills and invasive alien plant species (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is also potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its global distribution is restricted to within c. 10<sup>o</sup> latitude from the polar edge of continent and within which 20-50% of current vegetation type is projected to disappear under doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> levels (BirdLife International unpublished data)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","The global   population was estimated to number c. 380,000 individuals in 2006 (Wetlands   International 2006). However following the reclamation of the tidal flats at   Saemanguem (South Korea), c. 90,000 non-breeding individuals disappeared from the area.   Surveys elsewhere in South Korea confirmed they had not been displaced, and a   decline of the same magnitude and timing in Australia suggests that   individuals previously using Saemanguem have died (D. Rogers in litt. 2009).   Therefore a new global population was estimated at 292,000-295,000 individuals in 2007 (Wetlands International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species breeds in north-east Siberia, <strong>Russia</strong>, wintering mainly in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia,</span> but also throughout the coastline of South-East Asia and on the coasts of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India, Bangladesh, Pakistan</span>, and the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. The Yellow Sea of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">North Korea, South Korea </span>and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span> is a particularly important stop-over site on migration in both spring and autumn. The Yalu Jiang coastal wetland in the north Yellow Sea has been identified as a key site for the species during northward migration (Choi <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is thought that the southern Yellow Sea is used as a temporary stopover area whilst the northern Yellow Sea acts as a key staging site where birds refuel (Ma <em>et al</em>. 2013). The global population has been estimated at 380,000 individuals, of which 176,000 were thought to pass through <strong>South Korea </strong>(Wetlands International 2006). Since then the reclamation and development of wetlands in South Korea has led to a decline in the observed counts of non-breeding populations, mostly notably including dramatic declines at the Saemangeum wetland which previously held c.20-30% of the global population on migration (Moores <em>in litt.</em> 2009, Rogers <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>.

It also frequented damp pastures (including those grazed by buffalo) bordering marshes thickly covered in sedges and low aquatic vegetation, open areas near freshwater ponds, and was also found in agricultural fields and rice-paddies (van Balen and Nijman 2007)<strong></strong>. It occurred in isolated pairs, often in rather large areas, suggesting that it must have been a naturally low-density species. Breeding season was May to June in West Java (Wiersma and Kirwan 2013). It was probably resident, although it may have undergone local movements or migration, as suggested by its erratic and off-shore occurrences (van Balen and Nijman 2007). Its diet is thought to have consisted of freshwater invertebrates and plant seeds (Wiersma and Kirwan 2013).<p></p>","Its decline has been attributed to 'merciless' hunting and trapping. However, it seems far more likely that high levels of human disturbance and conversion of its habitat to aquaculture and agricultural land were the principal agents.

At sea, they typically remain over the continental shelf in Argentina (Stokes <em>et al. </em>1998, Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2002, Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Boersma and Rebstock 2009, Raya Rey <em>et al.</em> 2010, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Yorio <em>et al</em>. 2010, Raya Rey <em>et al.</em> 2012, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2012, Gómez-Laich <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rosciano <em>et al.</em> 2016), but may forage in deep waters off the (very narrow) shelf in Chile (Raya Rey <em>et al</em>. 2013, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Pütz <em>et al</em>. 2016) <em></em>and in the Falkland <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Islands (Malvinas) (Pütz <em>et al.</em> 2002<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">). Individuals may also forage on the continental slope; males tend to be more offshore-foragers compared to females. They dive up to almost 100 m, but more often to a few dozen metres (Walker and Boersma 2003, Raya Rey<em> et al</em>. 2012, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gómez-Laich <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rosciano <em>et al</em>. 2016). They may be seen foraging in shallow water close to the shore, but more often forage out of sight of land. Penguins tracked by satellite, GPS and geolocation tags during incubation typically foraged more than 100 km, and sometimes as much as 600 km from various colonies in Argentina (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boersma and Rebstock 2009, Boersma<em> et al. </em>2009, 2013, 2015). Even when provisioning chicks, adults forage hundreds of kilometers from the colony (Boersma and Rebstock 2009, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Boersma <em>et al. </em>2009), although at many colonies they travel up to a few dozen km (Raya Rey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Yorio <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2012, Gómez-Laich <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rosciano <em>et al</em>. 2016).

In the 1980s and early 1990s, oil pollution was estimated to kill more than 20,000 adults and 22,000 juveniles every year on the Argentinian coast (Gandini <em>et al.</em> 1994, Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al.</em> 2006, Boersma 2008), which is also the wintering ground for the population from the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (Pütz <em>et al.</em> 2000). This threat is now much reduced at least in Chubut Province, which now experiences mortality of less than 100 individuals every year (Boersma 2008, P. D. Boersma and E. Frere <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016). Chronic oil pollution and mortality still occurs off Brazil, Uruguay, northern Argentina and Chile (Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2008, Matus and Blank 2008). Future petroleum extraction is under consideration offshore of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Patagonia and Uruguay, which would likely increase mortality. Southern colonies are subject to disproportionately high mercury levels for their trophic level (Brasso <em>et al.</em> 2015). Birds from the northern colony in Punta Tombo colony have been found to have much lower mercury levels (Frias <em>et al.</em> 2012). Detrimental effects were not evident in that study, but mercury exposure could be a long-term or synergetic threat.<br/><br/>This species interacts with fisheries along the coast of South America, through bycatch mortality from gillnets, trawls and purse-seines (Gandini <em>et al.</em> 1999, Tamini <em>et al.</em> 2002, González-Zevallos and Yorio 2006, Schlatter <em>et al.</em> 2009, Yorio <em>et al.</em> 2010, Cardoso <em>et al.</em> 2011, González-Zevallos <em>et al.</em> 2011, Marinao and Yorio 2011, Seco Pon <em>et al.</em> 2013, Marinao <em>et al.</em> 2014, Suazo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Trathan <em>et al</em>. 2014, Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2015, Suazo <em>et al. </em>2016, L.

Population trends in response to these threats have not been quantified.&#160;Fisheries may also reduce prey for penguins; the hake fishery in Argentina for example collapsed due to overfishing during the 1990s (Alemany <em>et al.</em> 2013). A potential expansion of the Argentinian anchovy fishery might impact breeding penguins (Skewgar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fisheries in northern Argentine Patagonia may be having an additional effect, as bycatch includes anchovy and juvenile hake, which are an important part of the species's diet (Frere <em>et al.</em> 1996, Gandini <em>et al.</em> 1999, Scolaro <em>et al.</em> 1999, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yorio <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further, fisheries for anchovy and sprat, both considered “underexploited” stocks, may be developed in Argentina and Brazil (Sanchez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Skewgar <em>et al.</em> 2007, Carvalho and Castello 2013).</p><p>Climate change has been reported to have an impact, as precipitation has increased over the last 30 years and young chicks that get wet often die from hypothermia (Boersma and Rebstock 2014). Precipitation causes nest burrows to collapse (Boersma 2009, Boersma and Rebstock 2014). Climate models show precipitation will increase over much of the species’s range, lowering reproductive output of many colonies (Boersma and Rebstock 2014). Decreasing breeding synchrony interacted with climate change to increase the part of the season when chicks are vulnerable to wetting (Boersma and Rebstock 2014). High temperatures in the breeding colonies can kill adults and chicks (Boersma and Rebstock 2014, P. D. Boersma unpublished data). Changing patterns of precipitation and atmospheric and oceanic circulation are likely to affect winter conditions in the Atlantic, indirectly affecting breeding, as the extent of the Rio de la Plata plume affects females' colony arrival timing and body condition (Rebstock and Boersma 2018). Indirect effects of climate change through changes in prey populations or availability are completely unknown. <br/></p><p>In some areas of Chile, eggs and adults are collected for human consumption and adults are taken for bait (Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2013, Suazo <em>et al.</em> 2013, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Boersma <em>et al.</em>   2015). Egg-collection occurred also in the Falklands Islands (Malvinas). The introduction of feral dogs and other invasive species in  the breeding colonies have resulted in local extirpations (Suazo <em>et al.</em>  2013), but population level declines have not been quantified. Tourism may disturb individuals at breeding colonies when not well managed (Boersma 2008). Long-term physiological effects of visits by tourists are not understood (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006). Many of the threats may result in low impacts on the population, but there are many threats that probably have additive effects.<br/></p><p></p>","The world population is estimated at between 1.1 and 1.6 million pairs, which equates to 2.2-3.2 million mature individuals.

Tanker lanes were moved 40 kilometers farther offshore along the coast of Chubut in 1997. This added to improvements at port loading facilities, which greatly reduced the number of oiled penguins in that area (Boersma 2008). The Management Plan for Punta Tombo is in place, but has not yet been effectively implemented by Chubut Province authorities. The Argentine government has created new marine protected parks along the coast, which include some penguin breeding areas and fragments of foraging areas (Patagonia Austral, Isla Pinguino, Makenke and Monte Leon). Specifically, a new UNESCO Biosphere Reserve will help give protection to 20 colonies (Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al. </em>2015). A new Marine Protected Area (MPA) for the large colony has been designated in Argentina (Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2015, Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al. </em>2015). Unfortunately, many of the parks lack effective planning and/or implementation. As MPAs are in general ineffective for the protection of highly mobile species such as penguins (Boersma and Parrish 1999), protection of penguin populations requires new conservation tools (Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2007, Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al.</em> 2008, Yorio 2009, Stokes <em>et al.</em> 2014, Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Size varies among geographic areas, with males typically larger  than females. River otters display delayed implantation, resulting in a  period of almost one year from time of breeding until giving birth.  Young generally are born in February and March, and breeding occurs  shortly thereafter, well before the young are independent (Liers 1951,  Hamilton and Eadie 1964). Males and females are sexually mature at two  years of age, but variation in the reproductive age has been reported  (Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Docktor <em>et al.</em> 1987). Litters typically are comprised of 1 to 3 young (Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Tabor and Wight 1977, Docktor <em>et al.</em>  1987). Maximum life expectancy is typically about 10 years of age in  the wild and up to 20 years of age in captivity (Stephenson 1977,  Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003). <br/><br/>The North American river otter is  an aquatic-habitat generalist, capable of exploiting virtually all  freshwater systems, estuaries, and some coastal and marine areas  depending on the availability of adequate prey and riparian cover  (Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003). The diet of the river otter is comprised  mostly of fish, but amphibians (mostly frogs), crustaceans (mainly  crayfish), and birds may also be eaten depending on the region and  season (Sheldon and Toll 1964, Knudsen and Hale 1968, Stenson <em>et al.</em> 1984, Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1990, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1994, Stearns <em>et al.</em>  2011). Typically, the slowest moving and most abundant fish (e.g.,  members of the sucker and minnow families) species are preyed upon most  (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1990, Stearns <em>et al.</em> 2011). Depending on availability, crayfish in some areas exceed the importance of fish in the river otter diet (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1990). River otters prefer undisturbed riparian with adequate cover to serve as denning and resting sites (Swimley <em>et al.</em> 1998, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011). Both diet and riparian habitat use vary based on regional differences in aquatic systems and associated conditions. <br/><br/>Ultimately,  river otter populations are limited by the distribution of suitable  aquatic and riparian habitats. Consequently, any factors that reduce the  quantity or degrade the quality of aquatic environments will adversely  affect populations. River otters are often associated with aquatic  habitats modified by the construction of dams and lodges by the American  beaver (<em>Castor canadensis</em>) (Reid <em>et al.</em> 1994; Swimley <em>et al.</em>  1998, 1999). River otters are otherwise most active during nocturnal  and crepuscular periods (Melquist and Hornocker 1983, Stevens and  Serfass 2008). The extent of travel is influenced by sex, age class,  region, season, and habitat conditions (Spinola <em>et al.</em> 2008). Males occupy larger home ranges than females (Melquist and Hornocker 1983, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1994, Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003, Spinola <em>et al.</em>2008). Home ranges for river otters occupying riverine habitats in Idaho ranged from 8 to 78 km<sup>2</sup>  (Melquist and Hornocker 1983). River otters generally maintain low  population densities (e.g., about 1 otter per 3.58 km of riparian  habitat in Idaho; Melquist and Hornocker 1983), apparently without the  need for overt (aggressive) displays of territoriality. Although  considered to be territorial, home ranges of adjacent individuals may  overlap to varying degrees based on gender and season (Melquist and  Hornocker 1983, Spinola <em>et al.</em> 2008). River otters likely avoid  aggressive interactions by practicing mutual avoidance through olfactory  communication facilitated by scent marking at latrines. Predation on  river otters has been reported, but is generally considered rare. River  otters are presumably most vulnerable to being attacked and killed by  larger predators when travelling overland or visiting latrine sites  (e.g., gray wolves [<em>Canis lupus</em>], bobcats [<em>Lynx rufus</em>], coyotes [<em>Canis  latrans</em>], domestic dogs [<em>Canis familiaris</em>] (Gable <em>et al.</em> (2017), and mountain lions [<em>Puma concolor</em>]; see Melquist <em>et al.</em>  [2003] for a review of these and other reported examples of predation).  However, there are isolated reports of river otters being preyed on in  water (e.g., by the American alligator (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>);  (<em>Crocodylus acutus</em>) (see Lariviere and Walton 1998). Trapping river  otters for fur is an important human-induced mortality factor in many  conservation jurisdictions in the USA and Canada (Bricker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>","Threats to otter populations in North America vary among regions and are  influenced by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and  characteristics of human activities. Prior to settlement of North  America by Europeans, otters were widespread among aquatic habitats  throughout most of the continent (Hall 1981, Melquist <em>et al.</em>  2003). The synergy of unregulated trapping and loss or degradation of  aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands and development of coal,  oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries resulted in extirpations  or declines in otter populations in many areas (Toweill and Tabor 1982,  Melquist and Dronkert 1987). River otter declines were particularly  severe in the USA, where, by 1980, populations were considered  completely extirpated from 11 states and had experienced severe declines  in nine other states (Nilsson (1980). The most severe population  declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats  supported smaller otter populations. Over the last 40 years  reintroduction projects and factors that control trapping intensity have  facilitated the recovery of extirpated river otter populations in many  areas of North America (Raesly 2001, Bricker <em>et al.</em> 2016).  Improvements in the conservation status of river otter populations in  North America, particularly the USA, constitutes a substantial  conservation success story, but efforts are still needed to guard  against complacency in conserving the species and in addressing ongoing  and potential threats that may be overlooked by failing to understand  ecological aspects of the species throughout its range.  <br/><br/><em>Fur  trapping </em>- The River otter has transitioned from a species of  conservation concern in many areas of North America to one that is now  widely legally trapped for fur, including states where the species was  reintroduced (Bricker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). This trapping of river  otters is generally considered by management authorities in the USA and  Canada to be sustainable. However, increases in river otter harvest have  furthered the need for implementing reliable approaches for monitoring  the long-term status of populations, which is currently lacking  throughout most of North America, especially where river otters are  trapped for fur. Bricker <em>et al.</em> (2016) showed that relatively  few USA states or Canadian provinces and territories that harvest river  otters have formal monitoring protocols for assessing either the  density or the distribution of populations, except for recording annual  trapper-kill levels and sometimes deriving demographic data from those  killed otters. <br/><br/>An important issue that has not been meaningful,  relates to levels of trapping that may enable perpetuation of local  populations at levels below biological carrying capacity, but inhibits  natural expansion. Interestingly, reintroduced river otter populations  appear to have expanded rapidly with protection from legal trapping  (Becker <em>et al.</em>&#160;in press). Such outcomes necessitate an  introspective review of why legally trapped, native populations  seemingly did not expand at rates comparable to reintroduced  populations. This outcome suggests that trapping native populations of  river otters, even if sustainable at local levels may, have diminished  natural expansion by some of these populations. A better understanding  of the dynamics of sustainable trapping in relation to natural expansion  of river otter populations is in need of additional research attention.  Expansion of river otter populations is undoubtedly associated with the  combination of better trapping regulations, downward trends in the  number of trappers, and periods of lower fur prices, which further  diminishes levels of trapping intensity. Understanding the interaction  between trapping and expansion of populations will be particularly  important in areas where there is relatively high levels of river otter  trapping (and the trapping of species that often result in the  unintended capture of river otter, e.g., American beavers) or if there  is a general increase in number of trappers and intensity of trapping  pressure. However, particularly lacking is an integrated approach that  can be applied overtime and conservation jurisdictions to meaningful  assess population trends.  <br/><br/><em>Monitoring </em>- Trapping river otters  for fur is regulated, but population-level effects need better  monitoring. The influence of water quality and riparian disturbance need  better evaluation based on categories of pollutants and disturbances.  Formalized monitoring is important for examining expansions and  contractions of river otter populations in relation to various  management schemes (e.g., reintroductions and trapping) or environmental  conditions (e.g., presumed habitat quality). Science-based trapping  management is based on the premise that wildlife populations can be  harvested sustainably. To ensure that this criterion is met, some level  of monitoring to understand changes in the size, age and gender  structure, as well as the distribution of trapped populations is  necessary. The Appendix II listing of the river otter by CITES mandates  the tagging of all river otter pelts intended for export outside of the  U.S. and Canada (USFWS 2014). Records kept as part of the pelt tagging  process ensure that wildlife agencies in jurisdictions where river otter  are legally trapped will document the number of individuals harvested  annually. Most conservation jurisdictions do not have population  estimates for river otter populations. Instead, trapping data where  river otters are legally trapped or accidental captures of otters (where  otters are protected, but caught in traps intended for legally trapped  species) is often used to assess population trends (e.g., Chilelli <em>et al.</em>  1996). Unfortunately, in contrast to the grid-based monitoring protocol  followed for the Eurasian otter (<em>Lutra lutra</em>) in portions of Europe, no  standardized landscape-level approaches are in place to serve as a  basis for meaningful landscape-level assessments to levels of population  declines or recoveries of the North American river otter – past of  present. Erb <em>et al.</em> (2018) provided rationale to justify adequacy  of current techniques used to monitor river otter populations in North  America, and presented a map depicting the extensive, range-wide  recovery of river otters. However, this depiction does not portray the  overall paucity of uniform and consistently applied approaches for  monitoring river otter populations at various scales and among  conservation jurisdictions.  The map presented by Erb <em>et al.</em>  (2018) highly overestimates the actual occurrence of river otter in the  landscape by not portraying the species in relation to the availability  and abundance of suitable aquatic habitats, and serves to demonstrate  the inadequacy of current approaches to monitor river otter populations  (see Hubbard and Serfass (2005) for an example of limitations in  depicting the distribution of river otters at various landscape scales,  and as an example of the standardized, large-scale, and integrative  approach used to monitor population Eurasian otters). Development of  formal monitoring techniques, standardized (and thus comparable) across  conservation jurisdictions and regimes (e.g., trapped versus non-trapped  populations), should be regarded as a priority for assessing and  mitigating long-term threats to river otter populations.<br/><br/><em>Limited  research on native populations</em> - Understandably, a large portion of  research with river otters over the last 40 years has focused on  evaluating aspects of reintroduced populations. However, comparable  focus on native populations has lagged, with the notable exception of  basic information derived largely from examination of carcasses obtained  in areas where river otters are trapped, including carcass tagging  associated with CITES requirements associated with the river otter’s  Appendix II listing. Basic natural history information is lacking for  river otters inhabiting coastal environments, particularly along the  Atlantic coast of North America, and northern portions of Canada.   <br/><br/><em>Sub-optimal  habitat use and oil spills -</em>&#160;Water pollution and other degradation of  aquatic and riparian habitats may limit distribution of otters and pose  long-term threats if enforcement of water quality standards is not  maintained and enforced. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent  source of water pollution in some areas that eliminates prey base for  otters and thereby inhibits recolonization or expansion of otter  populations. Expansion of reintroduced and, in some cases, native river  otter populations has resulted in the species now sometimes inhabiting  areas formerly considered sub-optional habitats (i.e., areas with  degraded water quality and riparian conditions). Consequently, there is  potential for the paradigm to develop that river otters are tolerant of  perturbations to aquatic environments, in lieu of long-term supporting  evidence. Current optimism about river otters being able to tolerate a  wider range of aquatic habitat disturbances may be misleading and  unfounded in that such disturbed areas could represent sink habitats,  where populations are sustained by dispersing individuals and not  through adequate levels of reproduction and survival by individuals  occupying the area. Assessments of source-sink dynamics is needed for  river otter populations inhabiting aquatic system with various types and  levels of pollutants, and riparian perturbations. The threat of oil  spills to river otters has been well studied and documented in Alaska  Oil spills (e.g., Bower <em>et al.</em> 2003). Additional research is  needed to clearly delineate the impact of possible threats to  populations that various forms of water pollution, agricultural and  other development along riparian habitats, industrial and housing  development in coastal areas, cumulative impacts related to loss or  alterations of wetlands, large flood control structures, and  interactions that these and other factors have on otter populations.<br/><br/><em>River  otter-human conflicts</em> - The reintroduction of river otters in many  states has in some cases been negatively depicted in the media because  of the species’ predatory (i.e., fish eating) habits. The successful  reintroduction of river otters in the states of Missouri, Ohio,  Kentucky, and Illinois was followed by strikingly similar patterns of  negative media messages suggesting that river otter predation was having  widespread negative impacts on commercially-reared fish and game fish  important to anglers (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 2014). Management actions,  including opening trapping seasons, subsequently were implemented in  these states purportedly to alleviate the public concern and animosity  portrayed in the media about river otters. Wildlife agencies responsible  for managing trapping of river otters in some cases appear to have been  complicit in fostering negative portrayals about river otter predation  to gain public support for trapping seasons. Such negative portrayals  have the potential to contribute long-term deleterious consequences  regarding public attitudes towards river otters, thereby liming the  value of this species in serving as a flagship to promote conservation  of aquatic ecosystem (Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011). In contrast, the  Eurasian otter has been used extensively and successfully as a flagship  to promote clean-water initiatives in Europe. <br/><br/><em>River otter  genetics</em> - River otters from Louisiana have most commonly been used as a  source for reintroduction projects in the US—about 64% of river otters  reintroduced in the US were obtained from this state. Serfass <em>et al.</em> (1998) and Brandt <em>et al.</em>  (2014) discussed genetic implications for river otter reintroductions  in North America. Ultimately, how genetic introgression associated with  expansion of reintroduced populations will influence the genetic  structure and subspecies delineations of river otter populations in  North America is unknown and should be the focus of future  investigations as a basis for developing strategies to that best ensure  maintenance of the species’ historic levels of genetic variability.   <br/><br/><em>Disease</em> - Diseases in wild otter populations is poorly understood and has received relatively little study (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1995).<em> Lontra canadensis </em>may be affected by canine distemper (Harris 1968, Park 1971), rabies (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1995), respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection (Hoover <em>et al.</em>  1984, Route and Peterson 1991). In addition, North American Otters can  contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia  (Harris 1968). North American Otters host numerous endoparasites such as  nematodes (Hoberg <em>et al.</em> 1997), cestodes (Greer 1955), trematodes (Hoover <em>et al.</em> 1984), the sporozoan <em>Isopora </em>(Hoover <em>et al.</em> 1984), and acanthocephalans (Hoberg <em>et al.</em> 1997, Hoover <em>et al.</em> 1984). Ectoparasites include ticks (Eley 1977, Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1992), sucking lice <em>Latagophthirus rauschi </em>(Kim and Emerson 1974), and the flea <em>Oropsylla arctomys</em> (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1992).<p></p>","By the early to mid-1900s North American river otter populations had  experienced extensive declines caused by various human perturbations  (e.g., unregulated trapping and water pollution). However, the combined  implementation of 22 successful reintroduction projects in the USA,  reduced trapping pressure, and implementation of environmental  regulations that improved water quality resulted in the recovery and  expansion of river otter populations in many areas (Raesly 2001, Bricker  <em>et al.</em> 2016). <br/><br/>Although, historically and currently  dispersed over a large geographic area in the USA and Canada, the  occurrence and abundance of the river otter ultimately is determined by  differences in the availability and productivity of aquatic habitats,  with largest populations occurring in coastal habitats (e.g., highly  productive coastal marshes associated with the Gulf of Mexico) and  populations largely excluded from regions where permanent water was  limited (e.g., permafrost regions of Canada and arid portions of the  southwestern United States). Population densities for the species are  poorly understood for most regions and habitat conditions in North  America.  Examples of estimates that have been derived show densities of  1 river otter per 1.25-3.60 km of coastline in Alaska (Testa <em>et al.</em>  1994) to 1 river otter per 3.9 km of riverine habitat in Idaho  (Melquist and Hornocker 1983). Population estimates are expensive and  difficult to calculate for species that are elusive, highly dispersed,  and often occur at low population densities, like the river otter (Kohn <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Instead, field-sign surveys (e.g. detecting scats at latrines,  but also other signs such as tracks in the snow) have been used in many  areas of North America to reliably determine the presence or absence of  river otters (e.g. Reid <em>et al.</em>&#160;1987, Shackelford and Whitaker 1997, Swimley <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Melquist <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Gallant <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Ben-David 2010, Stevens <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Just <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). These types of evaluations should be incorporated with studies  intended to determine population densities through extracting DNA from  scats as a means of enhancing approaches used to monitor overall size  and distribution of populations (Fike <em>et al.</em> 2004). More recently, Mowry <em>et al.</em>  (2011) applied the use of genetic technology for a mark-recapture  approach in estimating river otter densities along several riverine  systems in Missouri, USA. However, the application of this technique  must consider natural history aspects of the river otter to account for  differences in spraint-marking by individuals based on sex and  seasonality (e.g. Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, 2009; Stevens and Serfass 2008; Serfass <em>et al.</em> 2019), so as not to violate various assumptions associated with mark-recapture studies.&#160;<br/>Trapping  for fur constitutes a substantial human-induced form of mortality on  river otter populations. Trapping river otters continued during periods  of population declines in regions where viable populations persisted  (Nilsson 1980, Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003). The  recovery of river otter populations has coincided with an overall  expansion in areas were the species is legally trapped for fur. From  2006–2012, 170,894 (x̅ = 24,413; SD = 6,642; range: 17,055–35,128) and  82,698 river otters (x̅ = 11,814; SD = 1,283; range: 9,604–13,934) were  respectively trapped in the USA and Canada (Bricker <em>et al.</em> 2016).<p></p>",Stable,"At the time of the America’s first European colonization, the North  American river otter was one of the most widely distributed mammalian  species in North America, occurring in an area roughly bounded within  25° 08’–68° 20’ N latitude and 55° 30’–162° 49’ W longitude  (Anderson 1977, Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003).  The species’ historic  range included a variety of coastal and inland aquatic habitats  throughout much of the North American continent, from arctic Alaska and  northern Canada to the southern USA (Hall 1981, Melquist <em>et al.</em>  2003). By the mid-1950s the North American river otter had undergone  severe population declines including local and regional extirpations  throughout extensive portions of its historic range, especially in many  non-coastal areas of the USA and southern Canada. However, river otters  have recovered in many areas and now occupy aquatic habitats in at least  portions of its historic range in each USA state (except Hawaii, where  the species never occurred), Canadian province or territory, (except  Canada’s Prince Edward Island where the populations are extirpated,  although there is some evidence of individuals recolonizing the  province). Recently, there is evidence of a population of North American  river otters occupying an area of northern Mexico (Gallo-Reynoso 2019).",For Use and Trade information see under Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The North American river otter is included in CITES Appendix II. This  listing is in place to assure that the ongoing legal trade does not  contribute to illegal trade of similar species of otters with a higher  level of conservation concern (i.e., what is referred to as “look-alike”  species, which could be illegally integrated with the legal trade of  species with a similar appearance. See USFWS, 2014). Although trapped  for fur, the overall trade in the fur of North American river otter  generally should be regarded as sustainable. Considering that the river  otters had experienced substantial declines caused by unregulated fur  harvest in the 1800s and degradation of aquatic habitats through the  mid-1900s, the current status of the species should be regarded as a  substantial conservation success story. These declines were particularly  severe in the USA, where, by 1980, populations were considered  completely extirpated from 11 states and endangered in 9 others (Bricker  <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, populations have since expanded to  occupy at least portions of the river otter’s historic range in all USA  states and Canadian Provinces, except Prince Edwards Island (where there  is recent evidence that some individuals may be pioneering the  Province). The overall increase in the distribution and abundance of  river otters was facilitated by a combination of reintroduction projects  implemented in 22 states, improvements in aquatic habitat quality, and  the natural expansion of native populations range (Bricker <em>et al.</em>  2016). The conservation status of river otter populations in North  America has improved considerably through progressive conservation  efforts, including implementation of clean water regulations (e.g., the  federal Clean Water Act, EPA undated).   <br/><br/>Camp (2017) provides a  comprehensive literature review for the North American river otter,  which will be extremely useful in developing conservation planning and  developing conservatin0related research projects.<p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The only monitored and well know population trend is the population from Europe (Loy 2018), where the Eurasian Otter had undergone a strong decline between 1970 and 2000 (Macdonald and Mason 1994). Following strict protection and environmental regulations, the species is increasing in both AOO and EOO in most countries (Conroy and Chanin 2001), although at different rates in each country. In 2015 the proportion where otters were believed to be threatened, declining, very rare or extinct had gone down from 40% to 22% (Roos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). However, increasing rates are only available for European Union countries, following monitoring obligations under Habitat Directive 92/43/EEC, whereas for the largest part of the range either decreasing or increasing rates have not been quantified. </p>  <p>Clear evidences of conservation dependence come from the European Union where the adoption of strict legal protection of both the species and its habitat (Habitat Directive <span lang=""EN-GB""><a href=""file:///C:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Temp/92/43/EC"">92/43/EC</a>, Appendix II, IV <span lang=""EN-GB""><a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/index_en.htm"">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/index_en.htm</a>), and banning of harmful pollutants, especially polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCBs / PCTs, EU <span lang=""EN-GB""><a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31996L0059"" target=""_blank"">Directive 96/59/EC</a>&#160; <span lang=""EN-GB""><a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pcbs/index.htm"">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pcbs/index.htm</a>),&#160; prompted a reversal of the declining trend and the recovery in most of its former range (Elmeros&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Cortes 1998, Kranz and Toman 2000, Prigioni&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Loy 2018). The same occurred for the Republic of South Korea, where law enforcement (Wild Fauna &amp; Flora Act 2004, National treasure n.330 by Cultural Heritage Administration), and habitat improvement (actions for forests and water quality) allowed the recovery of <em>Lutra lutra</em> in most of the country (Hong 2016; Hong&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, 2020).</span></span></p>  <p>There is ample evidence that the population in western Europe is still recovering and returning to its historical range. The Eurasian Otter is now common in Austria, Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and it is likely common in Albania and Serbia. The expansion in France, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Slovenia have likely driven the reappearance in Switzerland, north Italy, and Belgium (see the last HD report <span lang=""EN-GB"">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/knowledge/rep_habitats/index_en.htm#heading2013/18). However, the otters are still extinct in Luxembourg, endangered in Italy, very rare in Switzerland and Belgium, and rare in west Germany and east France. Its status is unknown in Bosnia Hercegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo. Viable subpopulations occur in Russia, hosting about 40% of the range with an estimated population of 60-80,000 individuals (Olyenikov and Savaljev 2015). The otter is included in Red Data Books of 48 regions of Russia and is harvested in 21 regions (Olyenikov and Savaljev 2015). Its status is unknown in Belarus but is likely decreasing.&#160; </p>  <p>In Central Asia, it is rare or endangered in Kazakhstan (around 100 individuals left), Armenia, Azerbaijan Tajikistan, Uzbekistan. It is vulnerable in Afghanistan, and vulnerable but likely increasing in Georgia (Gorgadze, 2004). It is declining and becoming rare in Iran and Iraq (Mirzaei&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Al-Sheikhly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). It is likely declining in Turkey. Its status is unknown in Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. It is becoming rare outside protected areas in India. It is endangered in Sri Lanka, decreasing in Pakistan, and rare in Bangladesh. It is common in Nepal and likely common in Bhutan.</p>  <p>The situation in South East Asia is complex, also as a consequence of range overlap among three otter species (<em>Lutra lutra, Lutrogale perspicillata</em>, and <em>Aonyx cinereus</em>), which makes surveys through indirect signs (mainly spraints) often uncertain. The Eurasian Otter is considered rare in Cambodia and Thailand, vulnerable in Vietnam, threatened in Sumatra and very rare in Borneo where it was just discovered. It is likely common in North Korea. Its status is unknown in Laos and Myanmar.</p>  <p>In North Africa it is common in north Tunisia, but endangered in Algeria, and likely declining in Morocco (Delibes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).</p>  <p>The most critical situation is found in China and in the Near East. The Eurasian Otter underwent a dramatic decline in China throughout the 20th century and the population declined by 92%, especially in the North East, and it is now extirpated over much of its former range (Li and Chan, 2018).&#160; Residual populations are fragmented and mainly restricted to national nature reserves (Zhang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160; In 2016, the species was listed as endangered in the red list of China (Li and Chan, 2018). It is also endangered in Taiwan. In the Near East, the Eurasian Otter is very rare. It is critically endangered in Lebanon and Israel. It is threatened in Jordan and likely rare and declining in Syria.</p>  <p>The low population density at which otters occur makes them particularly prone to the removal of even a seemingly small proportion of breeding aged adults due to different levels of threats. As adults get removed and territories become empty, the population collapses into smaller fragments, consequently leading to the smaller populations becoming non-viable due to lack of connectivity between populations (Jefferies 1988). Evidences suggest that there is an ongoing population decline at specific portions of its range (Loy 2018), but at a rate no longer exceeding 30% over the past three generations (23 years, based on Pacifici&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). This reduction in population (A2c) is suspected from the continuing decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and habitat loss. This Near Threatened assessment is more of a precautionary listing, as it indicates that while the recovery in western Europe and South Korea is genuine, the conservation actions for this species need to be sustained. Besides, there is still concern about what is happening in parts of its range in the Near East and Asia due to increasing habitat loss, water pollution, and poaching (Gomez and Bouhuys 2018).</p>","<p>The Eurasian Otter lives in a wide variety of aquatic habitats, including highland and lowland lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and coastal areas independent of their size, origin or latitude (Mason and Macdonald 1986, Kruuk, 2006). In Europe, they are found in the brackish waters from the sea level up to 1,000 m in the Alps (Ruiz-Olmo and Gosalbez 1997) and above 3,500 m in the Himalayas (Prater 1971) or 4,120 m in Tibet (Mason and Macdonald 1986). In the Indian sub-continent, Eurasian Otters occur in cold hill and mountain streams. During summer (April - June) in the Himalayas they may ascend up to 3,660 m. These upward movements probably coincide with the upstream migration of fish for spawning. With the advent of winter, the otters come down to lower altitudes (Prater 1971). In a study conducted in Thailand in Huai Kha Khaeng where the Eurasian, Smooth-coated and Small-clawed Otters live sympatrically, Kruuk <em>et al</em>. (1994) found that the Eurasian Otters used rapidly flowing upper parts of the river. In Sri Lanka, the Eurasian Otter inhabits the headwaters of all the five river systems but is not found in the estuaries (de Silva 1996).</p>  <p>Otters are well adapted to modified landscapes (Bueno-Enciso <em>et al.</em> 2014, Kloskowski&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Pedroso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Sales-Luís&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Weber 2011). However, in most parts of its range, its occurrence is correlated with bank side vegetation providing dens and reproductive holts (Mason and Macdonald 1986, Loy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004; Carone&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The Eurasian Otters are closely connected to a linear living space. Most portion of their activity is concentrated to a narrow strip on either side of the interface between water and land (Kruuk 2006). Otter distribution in coastal areas especially the location of holts, is strongly correlated with the presence of freshwater (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1989, Beja 1991).<span lang=""EN-GB""> <br/> <br/> Green et al. (1984) and Kruuk (2006) found that adult males spent most of their time along the main rivers, whereas adult females occupied tributaries or lakes, as they did in Austria (Kranz 1995). Rosoux (1995) found no differences in habitat utilization between sexes and considerable overlaps in range. Young animals usually occupied peripheral habitat, but Green and Green (1983) found differences between immature and mature young males, the latter having access to all available habitats and the other restricted to marginal habitats, supplemented by visits to the main river when vacant, temporally or spatially. While males generally have larger ranges than females in the same habitat, sizes vary according to the type and productivity of the habitat, and methods of measuring ranges vary from study to study.<span lang=""EN-GB""> </span></p>  <p>Like most <em>Lutra </em>species, fish is the major prey of Eurasian Otters, sometimes comprising more than 80% of their diet (Erlinge 1969, Webb 1975, Ruiz-Olmo and Palazon 1997). In addition to fish, a whole range of other prey items have been recorded in their diet in variable proportions, accounting for the high plasticity of otter foraging behaviour and the varying importance of alternative food types in the species' diet (Remonti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Krawczyk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). These include aquatic insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds, small mammals, and crustaceans (Adrian and Delibes 1987, Skaren 1993). Non-native fish species and crayfish may form the bulk of the diet (Bueno<span lang=""EN-GB"">‐Enciso <em>et al.</em> 2014, Blanco-Garrido <em>et al. </em>2008, Britton <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>A review by Clavero&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2003) revealed a latitudinal gradient in diet composition being more diverse in southern localities and more piscivorous towards the north. &#160;These authors also found that Mediterranean otters are more generalist predators than temperate ones, relying less on fish, and more on aquatic invertebrates and reptiles. In a study conducted in Sri Lanka, deSilva (1996) reported that the overall diet of the Eurasian Otters consisted of 81.2% of crab, 37.5% fish and 8.7% frog. There was significant seasonal variation in the diet in different habitats. The relative importance of fish in the diet was significantly higher in the reservoirs and lakes than the rivers and streams. Crabs were eaten more than fish during the monsoon (de Silva 1997). Seasonal variation in diet was also reported by many authors in Europe (Brzeziński&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Otters living in riverine habitats compared to backwaters in Hungary, consumed more birds (3.9%and 0.7%, respectively), less mammals (0.5% and 0.9%, respectively), less reptiles and amphibians (5.6% and 10.2%, respectively) and less invertebrates (0.1% and 0.6%, respectively (Lanszki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In riverine habitats, otters preyed more frequently on larger fish than in backwaters, but the main fish prey was small-sized (below 100 g in weight, 85.6% and 91.7%, respectively) (Lanszki<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In Turkey,<span lang=""EN-GB""> otter diet was composed 69.91% of fish, 18.80% invertebrate, 4.39% bird, and 4.39% mammal (Toyran and Albayrak 2019). In South Korea Hong&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2019) fish formed the bulk of otter diet, which included also frogs, mammals, and reptiles. Also, the fish fauna and otter diet composition differed significantly, suggesting a preference for slowly moving prey. Fish (PO = 56.1%) and amphibians (PO = 22.5%) were the primary diet components of otters in Putna-Vrancea in Romania while in Lower Siret Valley, fish (PO = 36.7%) and crayfish (PO = 32.6%) formed the mass of the diet (Bouroş and Murariu 20 17). Fish consumption was all seasons high in Putna-Vrancea, except in winter. In Lower Siret Valley, the highest fish consumption was in the autumn and the lowest in the summer. In a study in Ukraine the otter diet included fish (55.24%), mammals (18.20%), reptiles (8.72%), as well as crustaceans (5.81%) and amphibians (5.58%) (Mikheyev 2017).</span></p>  <p>The Eurasian Otter is capable of taking fish as large as 9 kg, which is a rare occurrence (Chanin 1985), however, many studies in Europe have revealed that the fish consumed by the Eurasian Otters are relatively small with a median length of 13 cm (Kruuk 2006).<br/> <br/> The Eurasian Otter has been long considered largely solitary (Kruuk, 1995). Erlinge (1969) suggested that males were hierarchical and territorial, influenced by sexual factors, while female ranges were influenced by food and shelter requirements of the family group. However, a field and genetic tracking of a population in Portugal revealed that Eurasian Otters are more social than previously thought, with adult males and females with cubs overlapping spatially and temporally, and sharing diurnal resting sites more often than expected (Quaglietta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Ranges of males overlapped with those of 1– 3 females, whereas dyads of the same sex exhibited almost no overlap, confirming the classic mustelid intrasexual territoriality and a polygynous mating system (Quaglietta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Also, Kranz (1995) found evidence of social group formation beyond the occasional associations of two or more family groups, which suggests that under some circumstances, otters of all ages and sexes may form temporary mutually tolerant gatherings. In contrast, in Shetland, where several adult animals used the same stretch of coast, the species was strikingly non-social (Kruuk 1995). The family group of mother and offspring is the most important unit of otter society. </p>  <p>Within the group home range, shared by resident adult females, each had her own core area. Resident males had larger home ranges in more exposed parts of the coast which overlapped with other males and with at least two female group ranges. Male and female transients moved through group ranges, relegated to less favoured holts, habitat and food. In freshwater home ranges are longer for both sexes (Kruuk 1995). Both genetic and field data gathered in Portugal by Quaglietta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2013, 2014) revealed a male-biased dispersal and female philopatry. Subadult males dispersed for an average distance of 21 km (Quaglietta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). </p>  <p>In most of its range the Eurasian Otter is predominantly nocturnal (Green <em>et al</em>. 1984). In Portugal, Quaglietta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2018) found that the markedly nocturnal activity in a population was affected by seasonality and air temperature. In particular, otters lowered their daylight activity and increased their nocturnal activity during the dry season, being generally less active under higher air temperatures. Other extrinsic factors affecting otters’ daily rhythms were moon phase, habitat type and wind, whereas differences in activity patterns according to intrinsic factors were mainly related to males’ ranging behaviour and females ‘reproductive status. Green <em>et al</em>. (1984) found that activity was largely circumscribed by the solar rhythm so that the duration of activity varied through the year with night length. The reverse situation was found in Shetland with activity restricted by the day length (Kruuk 2006), which was linked to activity of prey species, with the favoured marine species more vulnerable in daylight and those in freshwater easier to catch at night. In coastal habitats, tidal patterns influence otter activity, with significant preference shown for feeding at low tide, both in Shetland and on the Scottish west coast (Kruuk 1995). </p>  <p>The Eurasian Otter attains sexual maturity at around 18 months in males and 24 months in the case of females, but in captivity it is usually three to four years (Reuther 1991). They are non-seasonally polyoestrous (Trowbridge 1983), mating in captivity has been observed at all times of the year (Reuther 1999). The gestation period is approximately 63-65 days, the litter size varies from 1 to 5, and the life expectancy is up to 17 years in captivity (Acharjyo and Mishra 1983) but drops to 5-7 years in wild populations (Ansorge&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Kruuk 2006; Hauer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, 2002).</p>","<p>The aquatic habitats of otters are extremely vulnerable to man-made changes. Canalization of rivers, removal of bank side vegetation, dam construction, draining of wetlands, aquaculture activities and associated man-made impacts on aquatic systems are all unfavourable to otter populations (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). In south and southeast Asia, the decrease in prey species due to extensive removal and overfishing in wetlands and water ways had reduced the population to an unsustainable threshold leading to local extinctions. Poaching is one of the main causes of its decline in south and southeast Asia, and possibly also in north Asia.<br/> <br/> Pollution is major threat to the otters in western and central Europe, the main pollutants posing a major risk to otters are the organochlorines dieldrin (HEOD) and DDT/DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Roos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, 2010, 2012) and the heavy metal, mercury. Currently, perfluorinated chemicals (PFAS) are found in elevated concentrations in otters (Roos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Acidification of rivers and lakes results in the decline of fish biomass and reduces the food resources of the otters. The same effects are known to result from organic pollution by nitrate fertilizers, untreated sewage, or farm slurry.<br/> <br/> In addition, major causes of mortality from range countries are drowning and road kills. Fyke nets set for eels, cray fish and fish as well as creels set for marine crustaceans have a great attraction to otters and a high risk to those that successfully try to enter these traps.<br/> <br/> A further potential threat is strangulation by transparent, monofilament drift net. A potential risk comes from traps designed to kill other species; especially underwater cages constructed to drown muskrats. Illegal hunting is still a problem in many parts of their distribution range. In several European countries political pressure especially by fishermen has resulted in granting of licenses for killing otters (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). Illegal trade for medicinal use and pet market is growing in South East Asia (Gomez and Bouhuys 2018).&#160;</p>","<p>In spite of several studies, the status of Eurasian Otter population is not known in many parts of its range, particularly in North Africa, and Central and South East Asia. The overall estimate of the population in the United Kingdom was around 10,395 individuals in 2004 (JNCC 2007), around 75,000–80,000 individuals in Russia in 2015 (Olyenikov and Savaljev 2015), around 1,000 in Italy (Loy <em>et al.</em> 2019). The status of its distribution has been reviewed by Loy (2018), though information on its abundance is still lacking due to knowledge gap on population size and area of occupancy (AOO) in many countries. </p>  <p>Density of otters may vary from 0.010 to 0.04 individuals/km in recently colo<span lang=""EN-GB"">nized areas (Saavedra 2002, Bonesi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Janssens&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and from 0.15 to 0.72 individuals/km in established populations (Erlinge 1967; Hung <em>et al</em>. 2004; Jansman <em>et al. </em>2002; Ulevičius and Balčiauskas 1996; Sidorovich 2000; Hauer <em>et al. </em>2002; Prigioni <em>et al.</em> 2006 a,b; Freitas <em>et al. </em>2007), mainly as a function of prey availability (Ruiz-Olmo <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kruuk 2006). According to Koelewijnr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2010), the effective population size <em>Ne</em> (i.e. the most reliable indicator of the effective number of breeding individuals in a population) was estimated for the Eurasian Otter as 8*(N/(4+4.92+24.71)); thus, about 24% of the observed population size. The main cause of this reduction is the high variance in both female reproductive rate (30–75%, Kruuk <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ansorge <em>et al. </em>1997) and male reproductive success (Seignobosc <em>et al. </em>2011). The real effective number will be even lower after correcting for the other factors. Thus, despite the increase observed in the number of animals in many populations, the populations might still be vulnerable because the effective population size is small. Population Viability Analyses suggested that long-term persistence of populations in Sweden<span lang=""EN-GB""> depends on female survival, the age of first reproduction and, to a lesser extent, to stochastic demographic factors (Björklund and Arrendal 2008, Seignobosc&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). A Minimum Viable Population was recently estimated in about 4,500 individuals (Loy <em>et al.</em> 2019). The low population density at which otters occur makes them particularly prone to the removal of even a seemingly small proportion of breeding aged adults due to different levels of threats. As adults get removed and territories become empty, the population collapses into smaller fragments, consequently leading to the smaller populations becoming non-viable due to lack of connectivity between populations (Jefferies 1988).</span></p>  An estimated nine adult females produced a mean of total 5.6 litters/year. However, the net reproduction per female per year of cubs that survived the first half year was estimated 1.38 by Seignobosc <em>et al.</em> (2011) in a reintroduced population in the Netherlands. The estimated juvenile female per 100 females attaining the first reproduction was 33.7 individuals in Shetland (Kruuk <em>et al.</em> 1989). In central Finland between 1985 and 2003 the temporal and spatial variation in the density of otter population was 52 otters, including 16 cubs in 11 litters in an area of 1,650 km² in 2002–2003.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Eurasian Otter has one of the widest distributions of all Palaearctic mammals (Ando and Corbet 1966). Its range covers parts of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. The nominal subspecies <em>Lutra lutra lutra</em> has the widest distribution, occurring throughout Europe, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia (Gorgadze 2004), Russia, North and South Korea.&#160; According to Olyenikov and Savaljev (2015) it is widespread northwest of Russia along the coast of the Barents Sea from Murmansk to the east, to the mouth of the Pechora River (except for the easternmost tip of the Kola Peninsula and the Kanin Nose Peninsula). To the east, the border of the species’ geographic range crosses Polar Ural Mountains, around Gulf of Ob and the Yenisei Gulf of the Kara Sea, pressing to the north of the line of the Polar circle, and covers the basins of the Heth and Kotuy Rivers. Further the border of distribution crosses the middle stretch of the Lena River, further to the mouth of the Kolyma River, then to the coast of the Bering Sea to the south of Anadyr Bay. The species can be found on Kamchatka Peninsula, Sakhalin Island and Bolshoy Shantar Island, the islands in the Peter the Great Bay, and some islands of the Barents Sea including Kildin, Kharlov, Maly Zelenets Islands. It went extinct in Kuril Islands of Kunashiri and Iturup during the 1950s as a result of trade and harvesting (Oleynikov <em>et al.</em> 2015). It occurs along the coastline of the Sea of Japan and Strait of Tartary, approximately up to 51ºN. Further north, it is only occasionally found in the littoral areas. </p>  <p>The ongoing recovery in Europe is filling the gap in central Europe, as the species is expanding from Austria, Slovenia, Denmark, Netherlands, east Germany, and west France. Following this expansion, it returned to Switzerland in 2016 and North Italy in 2011 (Pavanello <em>et al. </em>2015). A gap still exists in Northwest and central Italy, as the southern Italian population is expanding but is still highly isolated from other European populations (Giovacchini <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>  <p>In the Near and Middle East it occurs with isolated populations in Israel (northern Jordan basin, Hula Valley, Harod Valley, and Golan Heights, Guter<em> et al. </em>2005, likely extinct in Zvulun Valley and Carmel coastal areas, Ben Ari <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dolev <em>et al.</em> 2006, Guter <em>et al.</em> 2008), Lebanon (River Litani, Bekaa valley and northern Lebanon), Jordan (rivers Jordan and Yarmuk, Reuther <em>et al.</em> 2001), and Syria<span lang=""EN-GB""> (eastern Syria, between the Euphrates, its tributary, the Khabur up to Abu Kamal at the Iraqi border, Masseti 2009), south east Iraq.

The subspecies <em>L.l. angustifrons</em> is reported from Africa, north of the Sahara in Morocco (Delibes <em>et al.</em> 2012), Algeria and Tunisia.</p>  <p>In Central Asia, the two subspecies <em>L. l. meridionalis</em> and <em>L. l seistanica</em> occur in Armenia (Paul Buzzard, pers. com), Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. It is declining and becoming rare in Iran and Iraq (Karami<em> et al. </em>2006, Mirzaei <em>et al. </em>2010, Al-Sheikhly <em>et al. </em>2014). In Mongolia, it has been reported in the basins of the Onon, Selemdzha, and Tes Tsagaan Gol, Tengis River Eröö rivers basins, Numrug and Khalkh Rivers, Shishged and main tributaries (Byaran, Jamsai, Bus and Tengis Rivers), as well as in the Hovsgol, Ubsu-Nur, and Dayan lakes (Tsendjav 2005, Batsaikhan <em>et al.</em> 2010, Olyenikov and Savaljev 2015, Shar <em>et al.</em> 2018)</p>  <p>In China, relict populations of <em>L. l. chinensis</em> persist in well-protected nature reserves, in sparsely populated headwaters of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, at remote sites along international borders, and in densely populated deltas and floodplains (Li and Chan 2018). Hainan Island hosts the endemic subspecies <em>L. l. hainana</em> (Hung and Law 2016). A remnant population has been discovered in Hengqin Island (Li <em>et al. </em>2017).</p>  <p>Three subspecies,<em> L. l. kutab</em>, <em>L. l aurobrunnea,</em> and <em>L. l. monticolus</em> are distributed in the Himalayan river systems in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh (sporadic small population found in Chittagong and Chittagong hill tracts and in the wetlands of Mymensingh and Sylhet; de Silva 2011).</p>  <p>&#160;In India, it is also found in the Satpura Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh located in Central India, where it was historically not reported (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In southern Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, as the subspecies <em>L. l. nair</em> occurs. Despite the otters recently rediscovered in Tsushima Island, which have possibly migrated from South Korea, have been identified as <em>L. l. lutra</em> (Nakanishi and Izawa 2019), the native population belonging to <em>L. l. whiteleyi</em> is believed to be extinct (Ando <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p>  South Asia hosts the subspecies <em>L. l. barang</em>. Its occurrence has been confirmed from Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand (in Uthai Thani province in southern Thailand, IOSF), Myanmar and Bangladesh (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Hussain 1999). It reached the islands of Sumatra and Borneo but did not reach the island of Java.","Hunting and trapping is regulated in 21 regions in Russia, according to the game bag regulation of the Federal Game and Hunting Management Department.

Otters have been successfully reintroduced to reinforce populations in Spain, Sweden, Netherlands, and UK. However, the contribution of reintroduced population to the recovery of native populations seems limited (Saavedra and Sargatal 1998, Saavedra 2002, Arrendal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Koelewijn&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).</p>  <p>A European Breeding Programme (EEP) for self-sustaining captive populations was started in 1985.

Its populations are under rapid decline across mainland Southeast Asia, through habitat destruction and degradation, trade-driven illegal hunting (Poole 2003, Shepherd and Nijman 2014, Gomez <em>et al</em>. 2019) and human-otter conflict. This species is considered to be Endangered due to past and ongoing population declines. The species is suspected to have declined by at least 50% or more in the past three generations (30 years based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) due to habitat destruction and degradation, pollution, bycatch and prey depletion due to over fishing, and illegal hunting. It is anticipated that the current rate of decline will continue into the future and further threaten this species. The most important habitat is assumed to be peat-swamp forests in Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaysia, and Indonesia, flooded forests in Cambodia. They are observed in mangrove and tropical forest. These habitats have been destroyed for development in large scale. In its entire range, the Hairy-nosed Otter is under increasing pressure due to extensive poaching. In Cambodia, around the Tonle Sap Lake and other places, poaching of otters and other wildlife is common. In Viet Nam, otters are hunted for illegal wildlife trade, for meat and medicinal use. Wildlife trade involving <em>Lutra sumatrana</em> as pets was recorded several times in Indonesia. In Borneo, the destruction of forests for palm oil plantations, and, soon, the anticipated transfer of the capital of Indonesia to Kalimantan does not augur well for the future of this species. The principal threat to the fauna of the Southeast Asia is the burgeoning human population, and resultant pressure of this growth on natural resources. Lack of adequate prey species and suitable undisturbed habitat are putting additional pressures on all wildlife species, including the Hairy-nosed Otter. A combination of all these factors may lead to the extinction of the species unless appropriate conservation measures are taken soon. Owing to the past and ongoing threats faced by the species, it can be concluded that there is a suspected reduction in the species’ population by ≥ 50%, (criterion A2) due to an inferred decline in its area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO) and/or habitat quality (subcriteria c, d, and e). <a name=""_Hlk38804993"">Also, the exacerbation of these threats, due to lack or failure of adequate conservation measures, may lead to an accelerated decline in population by at least 50% over the next 30 years, further supporting the categorisation of the species as Endangered under criteria A2cde+3cde.</a></p>","<p>The species were reported in peat swamp forests at Pru Toa Daeng, Thailand (Kanchanasaka <em>et al</em>. 1998), and U Minh Thuong and Ha National Parks in Viet Nam (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Viet Nam, the species has recovered after the Viet Nam War.&#160; Road killed otters were also found near peat swamp forests in southern Sumatra, Indonesia (Lubis 2005), at Tumpat in Kelantan, Pekan and Muazam in Pahang, (Abdul-Patah <em>et al. </em>2020) between Sungei Besar and Tanjung Malim, Selangor, Malaysia (Tan 2015). Peat swamp forests are assumed to be one of the most important habitats for this species.<br/></p>  <p>In seasonally flooded forests of the Tonle Sap Lake, the species expands its range to the interiors of the Lake’s forested area at high water level, and shrinks to the shore at low water level (Heng 2007, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2016.) </p>  <p>Tropical forests were also their habitat, at Taman Negara in Pahang (Baker 2013), at Ulu Muda forest reserve in Keda in 2016 (Salahshour 2016) in Malaysia, and Hala Bala in Thailand (Sasaki pers.comm.).</p>  <p>The species was reported at low land wetland including <em>Melaleuca</em> and disturbed secondary forests, at Thale Noi in Phattalung, at Bor Lor in Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Thailand (Wanlop pers. comm.), at Bassac Marsh along the Mekong River, Cambodia (Heng <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; It inhabits along coastal areas near mangroves in Southern Sumatra, in Indonesia (Latifiana and Pickles 2013), Peam Krasop wildlife sanctuary, Dong Peng Multiple Use Area, Ream National park, Cambodia (Heng <em>et al. </em>2016), Deramakot Forest Reserve (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010), near Tabin Wildlife Reserve (Ishigami <em>et al.</em> 2017), Selangor in Malaysia (Woo. pers. comm.) and Danum Valley Conservation Area (Tantipisanuh <em>et al.</em> unpublished) in Sabah, Malaysia.</p>  <p>Road killed otters were reported in oil palm plantations, at Potian in Johor, Tasek Bera and near Chenor in Pahang, Malaysia, near Dungun in Terengganu, near abandoned mining ponds at Gopeng in Perak and Paya Indah, in Selangor (Abdul-Patah <em>et al. </em>2020, Sasaki pers. comm.). The species was found near oil palm and mangrove in Southern Central Kalimantan (Huda<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p>  <p>At altitude, about 900 m and in mountains, two skins from the northern Myanmar were reported (Sasaki <em>et al.</em> 2009, Duckworth and Hills 2008, Shepherd and Nijman 2014).&#160; At Cardamom Mt. in Cambodia, the species were found (Long 2000, Heng <em>et al.</em> 2016). Though Wayre (1974, 1978) considered that the species mainly inhabited above 300 m, mountain areas are not considered as the main, but subsidiary habitats </p>  <p>Heng <em>et al. </em>(2016) reported that the species is cathemeral, although showing trends toward more crepuscular or nocturnal behaviour in Cambodia.</p>  The Hairy-nosed Otter principally predates on fish (85.5%) followed by water snakes. They also supplement their diet with frogs, lizards, turtles, crabs, possibly small mammals and insects (Kanchanasaka and Duplaix 2011). Fish belonging to the families Channidae, Belontiidae, Anabantidae, Notopteridae, Synbranchidae, Clariidae, Nandidae, were identified in spraint samples from Thailand. The main prey identified were Three-spot Gourami (<em>Trichogaster trichopterus</em>), Common Climbing Perch (<em>Anabas testudineus</em>), and snakeheads (<em>Channa</em> spp.) (Kanchanasaka and Duplaix 2011).<br/> <br/>The species might be solitary, but cubs were seen in December to February, and one family observed consisted of both parents and a cub (Kanchanasaka <em>et al. </em>2003). Based on camera trapping in Cambodia, mating season of hairy-nosed otter could be during between November and March, and pregnant female was recorded in March and from one to three cubs were observed with female (Heng <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160; In Malaysia, a pregnant female bearing two fetuses was road killed in May (Sasaki pers. comm.).","<p>Confirmed locations for the species have gradually increased as scientific awareness increases. Their main habitats are lowland wetland forests including peat-swamp, tropical, <em>Melaleuca</em> and secondary forests. These habitats have been under severe threat by anthropogenic activities such as clearing of forests to grow plantations of oil palm and food crops such as rice, corn and soya bean.</p>  <p>The species has been found at markets in Cambodia (Long 2000, Poole 2003) and Myanmar (Shepherd and Nijman 2014). Information on the illegal trading of the species through the internet and social media was found from 2012 to 2013 one at Central Kalimantan, two East Kaliantan and two South Kalimantan, Indonesia, some of which were for sale (Reza and Aadrean, unpublished, Gomez <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species occurs in lower population densities than the Small-clawed and Smooth-coated Otters, hence the effect of poaching is far greater as compared to the other two otter species. In Cambodia and Viet Nam, poaching of otters and other wildlife is a common practice. Otters are hunted for illegal wildlife trade, and also for meat and medicinal use.&#160;Otters are also sold as pets in Southeast Asia, with the highest numbers of otters for sale were recorded in Indonesia, followed by Thailand, Viet Nam and Malaysia. Small-clawed Otters constituted a major portion (98%) of the sales, followed by the Smooth-coated Otter (1%) and the Hairy-nosed Otter (1 individual) (Gomez and Bouhuys 2018).<br/> <br/> Populations in Viet Nam are known only from two small national parks that are under intense pressure from the surrounding dense human population. Though there are other areas within the Mekong Delta that could contain other populations, with Mui Ca Mau the notable example, most are too small in size and suffering from similar problems to U Minh Ha and U Minh Thuong National Park.&#160; Interactive effects of large-scale changes to Mekong river system because of dams – impacts on Tonle Sap hydrology, fisheries etc – can be assumed to be having an impact on the habitat of otters, therefore directly affecting the species.</p>  <p>In Thailand, the species is susceptible to incidental drowning due to fish traps and road kills. The species disappeared from Klong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Khao Sok National park after the construction of a dam (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2008). </p>  <p>Cianfrani <em>et al. </em>2018 suggests the species is sensitive to precipitation seasonality, but climate change induced range expansion may be beneficial to the species. However, the species may subsequently be subjected to disadvantages in terms of increased human footprint, fragmentation, increased pollution, and susceptibility to diseases </p>  The natural low density of this shy and elusive species, its terrestrial ecology and its dependence on ecosystems that are often the first to be converted into agricultural land makes it extremely vulnerable to extinction.<br/> <br/> The principal threat to the fauna of Southeast Asian region is the burgeoning human population, and resultant biomass demand, which puts pressure on natural resources. Unavailability of adequate prey species and suitable habitat are putting additional pressure on all wildlife species, including Hairy-nosed Otter.","<p>There is no population estimate of Hairy-nosed Otter across its range. Based on past and ongoing threats faced by the species throughout its distribution, it is suspected that the species may have suffered a population reduction of more than 50% over the past 30 years (three generations, based on Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) and that it is likely to also suffer a future population reduction of more than 50% over the next 30 years.<br/></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>The Hairy-nosed Otter is the rarest and least known among the five species of otters occurring in Asia. It is endemic to Southeast Asia. The type specimen came from Sumatra. Once believed to be extinct, the Hairy-nosed Otter has been rediscovered in many parts of Southeast Asia. In southern Thailand it has been reported from Pru Toa Daeng Peat Swamp Forest, Narathiwat (Kanchanasaka 2000), Hala Bala Wildlife sanctuary, Narathiwat (Sasaki pers.comm.), Thale Noi, Phattalung and Bor Lor, Nakhon Sri Thammarat (Tantipisanuh <em>et al.</em> unpublished). In Viet Nam it has also been reported from U Minh Thuong Nature Reserve (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2001) and U Minh Ha National Park in Mekong Delta and from Cambodia it has been reported from Tonle Sap wetlands, Bassac Marsh along the Mekong River, Cardamom Mt. and three areas along coast, Peam Krasop wildlife sanctuary, Donf Peng Mutiple Use Area and Ream National park (Heng <em>et al.</em> 2016, Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2016). It has been reported from Malaysia at Keda (Salahshour 2016), Pahang (Baker 2013), Selangor (Tan 2015) and Trengganu (Sasaki<em> et al. </em>2009) and at Kelantan, Perak, Johor in 2010, Sabah (Abdul-Patah <em>et al. </em>2020). In Sabah, Malaysia, this species was confirmed at three areas, <em>viz</em>.

It is thought to occur in Lao PDR.</p><p></p>","Otters are hunted for the illegal wildlife trade in pelt, and also for their meat, as pets, and for medical use in Southeast Asia (Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2018). Throughout its range, the hairy-nosed otter is under increasing pressure from intensive poaching, evident from the seizures of pelts (Shepherd and Nijman 2014, Gomez and Bouhuys 2018). Although, <em>L. sumatrana </em>makes up only a small proportion of this trade, the highly fragmented and small population sizes of the species, makes the threats of poaching and illegal trade far more intense (Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2018). Several live otters were seized from Cambodia in 2008 and 2009, probably as specimens for the pet trade (Gomez and Bouhuys 2018). Seizures of otters, in Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam have increased after 2016, which can be attributed to the growing demand for pet trade (Gomez and Bouhuys 2018). With increasing demand for pet otters, especially in Indonesia and Japan, the value of rarer species, such as <em>L. sumatrana</em>, inevitably rises (Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/><br/>The threat mitigation measures for the species suggested in the Global Otter Conservation Strategy (Nicole and Savage 2018), include the conservation of existing habitats, increasing monitoring intensity, strict prohibition of illegal trade, and awareness generation among local communities which can aid in checking poaching and illegal trade and also help in gaining insights into new ranges wherein the species exists (Duplaix and Savage 2018).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p><em>Lutra sumatrana</em> is listed on Appendix II of the CITES.

The most severe threat to the species is habitat degradation and loss due to increasing anthropogenic pressure on wetlands and waterways. Much of the species’ natural habitats have been lost to development activities, including the construction of large-scale hydroelectric projects, reclamation for settlements and agriculture. In addition, aquatic ecosystems are increasingly being polluted by eutrophication and accumulation of persistent pesticides such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates through agricultural runoffs. This poses a threat not only to the otter populations living in the habitats, but also negatively impacts the aquatic prey biomass that the otters rely on (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). The aquatic prey biomass for otters has been depleted by humans. This is due to the increase in human population over the last century and the lack of effective rural development programmes in policies in order to be able to address the problems of poverty, thereby forcing people to be increasingly dependent on natural resources (Badola 1997).<br/><br/>In the entire south and southeast Asia there is severe conflict between otters and humans, because of poverty and the recent increases in aquaculture activities leading to indiscriminate killing of otters, either through direct persecution or indirectly through accidental trapping and drowning in fishing gear. In south and Southeast Asian countries, prevalent poaching pressure is affecting its survival. Given the extent of habitat loss and degradation that is occurring in south and Southeast Asia, coupled with the intensity of poaching, a reduction in otter population size has been observed in many parts of its range (Hussain 1993, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996, Hussain 2002, Nawab and Hussain 2012a). It is believed that the population has been wiped out from most parts of its range in Iraq due to intensive poaching pressure (Al-Sheikhly 2012). During 1991 -2003 wide areas of reed beds and lakes of southern Iraq marshes were reclaimed affecting otter population, though recent surveys have confirmed their persistence from southern as well as northern Iraq (Al-Sheikhly and Nader 2013).<br/><br/>The increasing illegal wildlife trade of Smooth-coated Otter for their pelts, as pets, or for traditional medicine poses a direct threat to the species. The effect of climate change will also negatively impact the availability of aquatic habitats that Smooth-coated Otter depend on by reducing water levels in long-term droughts and affecting prey densities, and also by the destruction of reproductive sites caused by tumultuous flooding events.<br/><br/>In view of all of these threats, it is concluded that although the quantitative data on population sizes and trends are lacking, it is suspected that the global population of the Smooth-coated Otter has declined by more than 30% over the past 30 years (or three generations, based on Pacifici <em>et al. </em>2013) (criteria A2) owing to an inferred decline on area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO), and/or habitat quality (subcriteria c, d, e), which qualifies the species to be categorised as Vulnerable under the criteria A2cde. Further aggravation of these threats, due to lack or failure of adequate conservation measures, may lead to a suspected future decline in population by at least 30% over the next 30 years, further supporting the categorisation as Vulnerable under criteria A2cde+3cde.</p>","The Smooth-coated Otter is essentially a plains’otter. In the Indian subcontinent they are adapted to live even in the semiarid region of northwestern India and Deccan plateau (Prater 1971). Generally, the species uses large rivers and lakes, peat swamp forests, mangroves and estuaries, and also rice fields for foraging (Foster-Turley 1992). In Southeast Asia, rice fields appear to be one of the most suitable habitats in supporting its viable populations (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). However, they were more abundant in the mangroves of Kuala Gula, Malaysia as compared to the rain forest rivers (Shariff 1984). In certain areas, such as Singapore, the species uses highly disturbed urban sites, with some populations showing a remarkable resilience in the presence of human activity (Theng and Sivasothi 2016, Khoo and Sivasothi 2018).<br/> <br/> Along the large rivers in India, the Smooth-coated Otters prefer rocky stretches since these stretches provide sites for den and resting. River stretches with bank side vegetation and marshes are used in proportion to their availability especially in summer as they provide ample cover while travelling or foraging. Open clayey and sandy banks are largely avoided as they lack escape covers (Hussain 1993; Hussain and Choudhury 1995, 1997). In the Tarai areas of the upper Gangetic plains the Smooth-coated Otters use seasonally flooded swamps during monsoon (July-September) and in early winter (October-February). Winter being the breeding season, the swamps are extensively used as natal den sites and nursery. By February-March the swamps begin to dry and the fish biomass appears to be depleted, consequently the otters move to the perennial rivers (Hussain and Choudhury 1997). In west Java, the Smooth-coated Otters prefer mangroves and tidal stretches of the rivers and rice fields. Freshwater swamps and coastal stretches lacking vegetation are avoided (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). In rice fields and pond areas they prefer sites having moderate diversity of vegetation. Rivers with moderate to slow or stagnant water and water bodies having a width of 10-40 m are preferred. In Huai Kha Khaeng, Thailand, the Smooth-coated Otters extensively use the slowly meandering river near the dam and the dam itself (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1994). In urban Singapore, in addition to natural sites, otters use human-made, concretized structures such as reservoirs and canals, and have adapted to use concrete and grass for grooming. Latrines, resting sites, and dens are present in areas with high human accessibility such as small gaps and crevices under bridges, and under metal beams and roads. They have been observed using stairs and ladders to access dry land in concrete canals with steep sloping walls (Khoo and Sivasothi 2018).<br/> <br/> The Smooth-coated Otter is predominantly a fish eater, but supplements its diet with shrimp/crayfish, crab and insects, and other vertebrates such as frog, mudskippers, birds and rats (Prater 1971, Foster-Turley 1992, Hussain and Choudhury 1998). In general, its diet is similar to that of Eurasian Otter. The range of fish in the diet varies from 75% to 100% (Tiler <em>et al</em>. 1989, Foster-Turley 1992, Hussain 1993, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996, Hussain and Choudhury 1998,&#160;Nawab and Hussain, 2012b). The Smooth-coated Otters exhibit the typical opportunistic feeding behaviour similar to the Eurasian Otter. Along the major rivers in India they eat more fish, often making up to 94% of the total diet (Hussain and Choudhury 1998), while along the coast in mangrove habitats and in rice fields it ranges between 75-100% (Foster-Turley 1992, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). In west Java otters inhabiting mangrove areas eat more of crustaceans, around 22% of the scats contain remains of crab and shrimp where as in the paddy fields in Malaysia, along with fish they tend to eat more rice field rats <em>Rattus argentiventer</em>, represented in 23% of the spraints (Foster-Turely 1992). In Singapore, along the mangrove habitats, prawn consisted 35% of their diets (Theng <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/> <br/> Hussain (1993) identified 12 fish species from the spraint of Smooth-coated Otter from the Chambal River, of which seven species were eaten throughout the year. <em>Rhinomugil corsula</em> (Mugilidae) and <em>Rita rit</em>a (Bagaridae) were the preferred species. At least eight species of fish were identified from the spraints from Malaysia (Foster-Turley 1992). Some of these include Gourami (<em>Trichogater </em>spp<em>.</em>), Climbing Perch (<em>Anabis testudineus</em>), catfish (<em>Clarius </em>spp<em>.</em>), snakehead (<em>Channa </em>spp<em>.</em>) and mudskipper (<em>Gobioidei</em>). In the rice fields they ate large amount of most common fish (<em>Trichogater</em> and <em>Anabis </em>spp.). The size of the fish consumed varied from 5-46 cm, often ranging between 15-30 cm (Wayre 1978). No significant relationship was found between the calorific values of the fish and the quantities consumed. Thus, the prey selection by Smooth-coated Otter is mainly influenced by its availability (Hussain 1993). In Singapore, at least 12 fish species from 11 families were identified from spraints, with the highest occurrence of fish from the Cichlidae family (Theng and Sivasothi 2016).&#160;Diet of the Smooth-coated Otter in Periyar Tiger Reserve, India, predominantly consisted of the exotic <em>Tilapia mossambicus</em> (51.54%) and <em>Cyprinus carpio communis</em> (9.16%), which reveals that the otters may contribute in controlling the rapid expansion of invasive species (Anoop and Hussain, 2005).<br/> <br/> The Smooth-coated Otter attains sexual maturity at twenty-two months in captivity (Desai 1974). Yadav (1967) observed first litter at four years of age. In captivity they mate during August to October in water followed by prolonged playful bouts between partners (Desai, 1974, Naidu and Malhotra 1989). Copulation takes place several times daily. Males are polygamous mating with up to four females (Desai 1974). In the wild in northern India mating occurs in August-September and littering in November-December (Hussain 1993). Desai (1974) observed litter size of 2-5 (mean = 3.25). Similarly, Naidu and Malhotra (1989) observed litter size 1-5. The breeding schedule of Smooth-coated Otters in the wild in India corresponds with the captive records (Hussain 1993, 1996). Evidences of littering have been recorded in October and the cubs were seen out of the den in February. The mean litter size along the Chambal River was three (Hussain 1996). In Singapore, litter size observed from two family groups over seven litters was 3-7 (mean = 4.86), with breeding being non-seasonal (Khoo and Sivasothi 2018).<br/> <br/> Based on the percentage of active telemetry recordings, Hussain (1993) observed that the overall activity pattern of Smooth-coated Otters along the Chambal River in India was in the form of a bimodal curve in which two period of high activity were separated by a period of relative inactivity. This pattern of activity varied considerably among seasons. In summer, the relative period of inactivity was greater than in winter or monsoons. A significant difference was also found between day and night time activities in different seasons. Otters were more diurnal during winter than in summer or monsoon. <br/> <br/> Hussain (1993) observed daily movements of four radio-implanted Smooth-coated Otters of different age and sex within their home range. Two types of movements were identified; small-scale movements associated with foraging in a restricted area close to dens, and more extensive travels between dens and foraging sites. Most of the movement was restricted between 250 to 1,500 m. A typical group of Smooth-coated Otter consisting of male, female, and up to four young ones require 7 to 12 km of river for their territory and an even longer stretch of shoreline if living along the coast (Wayre 1974). During a radio-tracking study along the Chambal River, India, the home range of all the otters tracked overlapped intensively. Among the radio-implanted otters, the maximum home range was observed in sub-adult male and the minimum in juvenile female and male. Among the non-tagged otters, the home range of female with cubs was estimated as 5.5 km. In case of the adult male it was estimated to be approximately 17 km (Hussain 1993). Along the Chambal River, the home range length and area of Smooth-coated Otter was less than that of Eurasian Otter, in Perthshire, Scotland and North American River Otter <em>Lontra canadensi</em>s in Idaho (Melquist and Hornocker 1983), but larger than that of Eurasian Otter (Erlinge 1967) in Sweden.","<p>The major threat to Smooth-coated Otter populations is habitat loss and degradation due to increasing anthropogenic pressure on wetlands and waterways. Much of the natural habitats have been lost to development activities, including the construction of large-scale hydroelectric projects, reclamation for settlements and agriculture. In addition, wetlands and waterways are increasingly polluted by eutrophication and accumulation of persistent pesticides such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates through agricultural runoffs. This poses a danger not only to the otter populations living in the habitats, but also negatively impacts the aquatic prey biomass that the otters rely on (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). The aquatic prey biomass for otters have also been depleted by humans.&#160; This is due to the increase in human population over the last century without effective rural development programmes that have been able to address the problems of poverty, forcing people to be more and more dependent on natural resources (Badola 1997). Although urban populations of Smooth-coated Otters occur in the Singapore, not every country or city may be able to replicate the myriad of factors (suitable riparian habitats, clean waters, free of poaching, etc.) that are required for the establishment of these otters.<br/></p>  <p>Severe conflict human-otter conflicts in the entire south and southeast Asia have threatened the otter populations in the region. Indiscriminate killings of otters driven by resource competition between humans, especially aquaculturists&#160;and the species occur, as otters frequent fish farms for foraging. This is exacerbated by poverty and a recent increase in aquaculture activities. In southeast Asian countries, there does not seem to be any intentional otter trapping (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996) though it is prevalent in India, Nepal and Bangladesh fueled by illegal wildlife trade.</p>  <p>The illegal wildlife trade poses a direct threat to the Smooth-coated Otter. From 1980 to 2015, 5,881 otter pelts were seized across 15 countries in Asia, with about half of the pelts coming from India and most cases involving the Smooth-coated and Eurasian Otters (Gomez <em>et al</em>. 2016). Otters are also coveted by the online pet trade, particularly in Southeast Asia (Gomez and Bouhuys 2018) and for use in traditional medicine in some countries of Southeast Asia and China (Poole 2003).</p>  <p>Linear infrastructure, such as road networks, have led to the fragmentation of wildlife habitats, thereby posing another threat to the species. There have been frequent records of road kills of otters in India and Southeast Asian countries, however, there is inadequate data available on the trends of mortality due to roads and other linear infrastructure. An insufficient reporting system for road kills also hampers an understanding of the level of otter mortality from vehicles.</p>  <p>Populations of otters are also susceptible to diseases such as rabies, canine distemper, canine hepatitis, and parvovirus, which may be contracted by Smooth-coated Otters from feral dogs or other species of otters.</p>  Climate change will take a serious toll on otter populations worldwide. Smooth-coated Otters depend on rivers, lakes and streams, which face dramatic alteration under a warming scenario, reducing water levels in long-term droughts and affecting prey densities, and also tumultuous flooding periods will lead to disruption in reproductive activities due to inundation and destruction of reproductive sites (Cianfrani <em>et al.</em> 2018).","Because of the elusive and mostly nocturnal behaviour of Smooth-coated Otter, reliable estimates of the species' population are not available. In Southeast Asia it is found in large groups (Foster-Turley 1992, Hussain 1993, Hussain 1996) where the basic family group consists of an adult female and her offspring, the father of the offspring, and older siblings may often join the group (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Hussain 1996). Group size varies considerably between months and seasons, the group being largest during the monsoon season (Hussain 1996). Along the Chambal River in Central India, the group size ranges from 1 to 9 individuals (mean=4.62). During a study conducted in the Corbett Tiger Reserve, in north India an estimate of 41 individuals (35 adults and six juveniles) with a mean of 5.1±1.55 was recorded from the 85 km of river stretch within the Reserve (Nawab and Hussain 2012a). In Singapore, Khoo and Sivasothi (2018) recorded approximately 79 individuals from 11 groups, with group sizes ranging from 2 to 14 individuals (mean=7.2).<br/><br/>Increasing habitat destruction, loss and degradation, overexploitation of resources, hunting and illegal trade throughout the Smooth-coated Otter's range represents the greatest threat to the species, the collective impacts of which are suspected to have caused a population decline of more than 30% in the past 30 years (three generations based on Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) and are expected to cause a population decline of more than 30% over the next 30 years.",Decreasing,"The Smooth-coated Otter is distributed throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia. Its distribution is continuous from Indonesia, through Southeast Asia, and westwards from southern China to India and Pakistan, with an isolated subpopulation in Iraq (Pocock 1941, Medway 1969, Hussain 1993). Though its current status in the Middle East is not known, its presence has been confirmed from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, southwest China, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Viet Nam, Malaysia (Penisular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak), and Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatra, Java) and Brunei (Mason and Macdonald 1986, Corbet and Hill 1992, Wozencraft 1993). Historically, the Smooth-coated Otter occurred in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province and the international borders of the Red River and the Irrawaddy in Yunnan Province. The presence records from Guangdong Province suggest a disjunct distribution in the species' continental range at the easternmost limit. However, due to an upsurge in the pelt trade during the 1900s, otters have faced a massive decline in China. There are no recent records of the Smooth-coated Otter from China (Li and Chan 2018).",Species is illegally utilized in wildlife trade.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>Smooth-coated Otter is a protected species in almost all the range countries which prohibits its killing. It has been up listed to Appendix I from Appendix II of CITES in 2019. However, most range countries are not able to control the clandestine trade leading to extensive poaching. </p>  <p>The Smooth-coated Otter, once common in the wetlands and low lying areas of south Asia, is now restricted to a few protected areas. Creation of networks of Protected Areas, identification of sites as wetlands of national and international importance under Ramsar Convention, has, to some extent, halted the degradation of its habitat. <br/> <br/> Over the years the IUCN SSC Otter Specialist Group has developed a cadre of biologist across Asia to conduct field surveys and has popularize otter conservation by promoting otters as ambassadors of the wetlands. A global strategy for otter conservation was also published by the IUCN SSC Otter Specialist Group as a consolidated effort to identify and discuss the significant factors that influence habitat quality and the presence of otter in each region where they occur. However, concerted efforts to conserve this species are needed. For the long term survival of the species, policy based action, research on factors affecting its survival, habitat based action on creation and wherever required expansion of protected areas, and communication and awareness building actions are needed. The Global Otter Conservation Strategy for the species (Hussain <em>et al</em>. 2018) recommends priority actions that include:</p>  <p></p><p></p><ul><li>Monitor population status of Smooth-coated Otter in protected as well as non-protected areas in all range countries.</li><li>Determine the status of <em>L. p. maxwelli</em> in the Iraqi marshes.</li><li>Support existing laboratories, and creation of new research facilities dedicated to research on conservation genetics of the species.</li><li>Support full-time research for otter conservation.</li><li>Organise workshops for capacity building, conservation education, and awareness in all range countries.</li></ul><p></p>      <p></p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
164580466,18711,Pteronura brasiliensis,Endangered,A2cde+3ce,2021,2020-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The status of Giant Otter is regularly monitored by its range countries. Of the 12 national assessments on the distribution and conservation status of the Giant Otter that were prepared, in two countries the species has been categorized in national Red Lists as Critically Endangered (Paraguay and Ecuador), in four countries as Endangered (Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia), and as Vulnerable in Brazil; it is considered Extinct in Uruguay, and probably Extinct in Argentina. In the Guianas, the Giant Otter is also protected by law though this is rarely enforced. There was a strong consensus among workers on Giant Otter that it should be considered as Endangered on a continental level. The total global Giant Otter population size is low but, more critically, individual subpopulations are fragmented and most are small. Because of its conspicuous behaviour and social nature, this species is easy to extirpate and is therefore extremely vulnerable. It remains highly susceptible to hunting (though currently hunting of Giant Otters is not a common practice). The killing of individuals and entire groups continues in some areas where fishermen are active, including in protected areas. Moreover, the Giant Otter is intrinsically vulnerable to extinction: combined with low habitat resilience and the fact that only a quarter to a third of the total population reproduces, the species also shows late maturity, late breeding age, suspected low transient survival, and low cub survival - all are traits which limit Giant Otter recovery and re-colonization. Although widely distributed on a continental scale, overall, they may occupy less than 5%, often less than 1% of a given watershed. This means that changes in this specific habitat, or impacts there-in, will have severe effects even if only a fraction of the overall area is affected. Rivers are roads into the forest, this is where people settle, where gold mining takes place, where there is competition for fish or overfishing, where “green” energy can be harvested, where climate change will have strong impacts, where contamination can be spread rapidly, and so on. This vital link to rivers and wetlands renders the Giant Otter much more susceptible than most other comparable large predators of the Amazon, such as the Jaguar.<br/> <br/> In South America, only 13 years from now (about half the time-span considered for this assessment) there will be an increase of 44 million people, much more than the total population of Peru. Brazil has seen the highest deforestation rate in the world and just in 2019 the deforestation of the Amazon represented almost 2,900 km² and at least 1.5 million hectares of the Pantanal have burned. There are estimates that the Amazon rainforest will be reduced by 40% in 2030. If just one or two of the Giant Otter’s strongholds is affected, this may be enough to lead to heavy declines in overall population numbers. Further, once remote watersheds are now accessible so that Giant Otters can no longer retreat to ‘safe zones’.<br/> <br/> Many emerging and/or growing threats pose serious problems for Giant Otters including contamination, overfishing and conflict with fishermen, and infrastructure such as roads and hydroelectric dams. With their preference for lowland wetlands, rivers, and lakes, their prime habitat overlaps completely with the demands of humans (gold mining, fishing, deforestation, mega infrastructure and energy developments, settlement, transport, tourism, etc.). The effects of climate change are already being felt, with Brazil recently suffering severe droughts. Large-scale deforestation in the Amazon could reduce basin-wide rainfall by 12% during the wet season and by 21% in the dry season by 2050 (Spracklen <em>et al</em>. 2012) with unknown impacts on (semi) aquatic species.<br/> <br/> In summary, three Giant Otter generation lengths approximately represent a 15 year period. Accelerating habitat destruction, degradation, and exploitation throughout the Giant Otter's range represents the greatest threat to the species, and is suspected to have caused a population decline of more than 50% in the past 15 years (three generations) (criterion A2), also potentially leading to a future reduction in population size of 50% or more over the next 15 years (criterion A3), suspected through a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and quality of habitat (subcriterion c), exploitation (subcriterion d),&#160; pollutants (especially mercury and fossil fuels), pathogens (domestic animal diseases), and competitors (fishermen) (subcriterion e) potentially playing important roles. Therefore, the species is listed as Endangered under criteria A2cde+3ce.","<p>The Giant Otter inhabits large rivers, streams, lakes and swamps (Duplaix 1980, Carter and Rosas 1997). In Suriname, the species seems to prefer black water creeks and rivers with sandy or rocky bottoms (Duplaix 1980). In Peru, large lowland rivers with gentle flow and oxbow lakes with high fish densities are preferred (Schenck 1999). In Bolivia, both clear and white water floodplains are used (Zambrana Rojas <em>et al. </em>2012). &#160;Since giant otters build dens and use campsites along the banks of water bodies, some habitat traits are important determinants of presence, such as gentle slopes and vegetation cover and proximity to the water’s edge (Lima <em>et al.</em> 2012). In seasonally flooded habitats, the availability of banks and other habitat features may change, and induce changes in habitat selection (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2013). During the peak inundation in the southern Pantanal, when no banks were available, giant otter groups used emerged shrubs as refuges and latrines (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2015). At such times, when prey is more dispersed, giant otters were observed in flooded forest, swamps and grasslands adjacent to the river (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2013). Territoriality and population density may lead some groups to use unusual sites, such as artificial lakes along roads in the southern Pantanal (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2013), even adapting their diet (Ribas <em>et al.</em> 2012). Giant otters also use agricultural channels (Laidler 1984) and the reservoirs of dams (Palmeirim <em>et al. </em>2014). The preferred habitat for giant otters seem to be undisturbed water bodies, with high-quality vegetation cover and abundant prey density.</p>  <p>Giant Otters are one of the most social members of the otter family. A giant otter group consists of a dominant breeding pair, non-breeding subadults and offspring. Group size can range from two to 16 individuals that may or may not be related (Ribas <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is related to the capacity of the group to defend high-quality territories, usually a function of group size (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2015, Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2015), possibly explaining the advantage of having non-related individuals in the group (Leuchtenberger and Mourão 2008, Ribas <em>et al. </em>2016). Giant otters attain sexual maturity at around 2.5 years old (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2011, Sykes-Gatz 2004), and the earliest breeding may occur at age three years (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2015). A group usually produces one litter a year, ranging from 1-6 young, but averaging 2 (Duplaix 1980, Staib 2005, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006, Leuchtenberger and Mourão 2008).</p>  <p>Groups live in well-established territories that are constantly defended by scent-markings at latrines, campsites and dens along the banks of lakes and rivers (Leuchtenberger and Mourão 2009), and warning vocalizations (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mumm Knörnschild 2017). Conflict encounters are common when an intruder is detected, and may lead to serious injuries or even death (Schweizer 1992, Rosas and Mattos 2003, Ribas and Mourão 2004). Territories vary in size from 0.5 km to 18 km in the dry season, and 8 to 24 km in the wet season (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2005, Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2015), and appears to be related to group size (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2015; Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2015). The size of neighbouring groups may limit the expansion of territory (Leuchtenberger <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p>The diet of Giant Otters consists almost exclusively of fish, but may also include caiman and other vertebrates (Ribas <em>et al.</em> 2012, Rosas-Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2012). The species is opportunistic in its diet and adapts its diet according to prey availability.</p>  The average reproductive lifespan is about five years for females and males (Groenendijk <em>et al</em>. 2014). This, in tandem with a mortality of about 50% (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2014), a suspected high transient mortality, and difficulty to establish new groups (Schenck and Staib, 1998), means that population recovery and colonization of new areas can be slow.","<p>The species is threatened by multiple human activities throughout the species range, destruction of riparian habitat, overfishing, contamination of water bodies - especially by gold mining, fossil fuel exploration, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers, diseases spread by domestic animals, and mismanaged tourism (Duplaix 1980, Schenck 1999, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Human populations are increasing and expanding. In the last census, the Amazon region registered the highest population growth in Brazil. Illegal settlements, road opening and deforestation threaten pristine habitats. Colonization of new areas are expected, followed by intensive exploitation of natural resources. Furthermore, proposed mega-projects in the 2007 Brazilian Growth Acceleration Plan represent a significant threat to Brazilian Amazonian and Pantanal habitats. Changes in government and environmental protection policies in Brazil endanger the pristine areas of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado. Between 2017 and 2019 4,500 km<sup>2</sup> of the Amazon were lost due to deforestation and burning, of which 65% occurred in 2019 (Cannon 2019, <span lang=""EN-GB""><a href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/"">https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/</a>). From August to November of 2019 at least 1,5 million hectares of Brazilian Pantanal were burned (<a href=""https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164"">https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164</a>).</p>  <p>Hunting for the pelt trade was the greatest threat to the Giant Otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazilian Pantanal (Duplaix 1980). From 1960 to 1969, records indicated a regional harvest of 12,390 giant otter skins. In 1973, giant otters were placed on CITES Appendix I, and the enforcement of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter&#160;skins in 1975 finally ended Giant Otter&#160;hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010).</p>  <p>The Giant Otter&#160;remains endangered because of the low recuperation rate of relict populations now also under pressure from human activities (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2015). Direct conflict between humans and otters is an increasing problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen, who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local and commercial consumption (Gómez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Rosas-Ribeiro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Giant Otters can drown in fishing nets and traps and are also blamed for damaging them (Rosas-Ribeiro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Utreras&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Fish farming is rapidly increasing in the species’ range, for example in parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and expose otters to retaliation killing (V. Utreras pers. obs.). Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to be kept as pets (M. Marmontel pers. obs).</p>  <p>Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, conspicuous, social, and very vocal. They are active at daytime and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their signs – latrines and dens - are easily recognizable, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the pelt trade years, these life history attributes made them an easy target for fishermen. In 2017, a Giant Otter&#160;group was killed by fishermen in the Pantanal and according to locals, kills occur frequently during the fishing season (C. Leuchtenberger pers. obs.). In 2011-2012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter&#160;killing in their territory (Território Indígena Kanamari), based on their perception that the species was overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges for the hunters, who shot 64 Giant Otters (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can lead to extinction of small populations in a watershed.</p>  <p>Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region, in southeastern Peru, the western region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and northern Pantanal. The main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kimbrough 2014). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high, whereas mercury is inexpensive. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003-2006 to 2006-2009 (Swenson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Even a decade after mining stopped, areas affected still had depleted fish populations and had not been re-colonized by otters. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish near Manu National Park were higher than considered tolerable for the Eurasian otter. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the area of influence of such contaminants. Contamination of otters by other heavy metals through pesticides and other agrochemicals is still poorly understood. </span></p>  <p>The many planned hydroelectric dams in the species’ range are a major threat to Giant Otters. These will alter hydrological regimes of rivers and affect fish populations and habitat (Latrubesse&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Dams disrupt the annual cycles of inundations, vital for the maintenance of populations of flood dependent species such as the Giant Otter&#160;(Mourão&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Alho and Sabino 2011). One hundred and eighty-four new dams are planned or under construction, greater than two MW capacity over the next 20 years in the Amazon. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes, such as the shallow Balbina Reservoir in Brazil (Rosas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In other areas, hydroelectric dams have depleted Giant Otter&#160;populations, as did the Curuá-Una Hydroelectric in the Brazilian Amazonia (Rosas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Around the Pantanal, there are over 115 projects of small hydroelectric plants. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012).</p>  <p>Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. It&#160;is important to control increasing levels of tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Research has shown that Giant Otter&#160;reproductive success and sighting success by tourists is considerably lower on unmanaged lakes than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006).</p>  <p>Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus, and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases may pose a serious threat to wild Giant Otter&#160;populations. Infection can also occur in remote areas, since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of vulnerable otter populations (Schenck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999).</p>  Climatic changes are predicted to increase suitable areas for Giant Otters (Cianfrani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, long-term habitat and climatic modifications will increase the exposure of suitable core otter areas to the negative effects of the surrounding unsuitable areas (Cianfrani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The species also has a high specialized niche, making it more vulnerable to climate change.","<p>There is no current total population estimate and current population trends are unknown: however, there is evidence that populations may be recovering in the Yavarí-Mirín River in northern Peru (Recharte and Bodmer 2010, Deza pers. comm. 2012), the Madidi and Itenéz or Guaporé Rivers in Bolivia (Ayala <em>et al.</em> 2015, Zambrana Rojas <em>et al. </em>2012), the Lagarto-Cocha and Cuyabeno rivers in the northeastern Ecuadorian Amazon (Utreras pers. comm. 2018), in the Amanã Reserve in Brazil Amazon (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2015) and the Brazilian Pantanal (Leuchtenberger and Mourão 2008, Ribas&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Tomás <em>et al</em>. 2015). Although in other regions, such as in the Department of Madre de Dios in southeastern Peru (R. Williams pers. comm. 2012) and in western Colombia (J.C. Botello pers. comm. 2012) populations are on the decline due to habitat loss and degradation, and other human activities. Most populations remain isolated from each other.

Also, due to their social organization, the total number of adult individuals does not represent the effective population size, as only the alpha couple of a given group reproduces.<br/><br/>Accelerating habitat destruction, degradation, and exploitation throughout the Giant Otter's range represents the greatest threat to the species, and is suspected to have caused a population decline of more than 50% in the past 25 years (three generations, based on Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013), and (based on current trends) is suspected to lead to a future reduction of more than 50% in population size over the next 25 years.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Pteronura brasiliensis</em> is endemic to South America and is distributed east of the Andes in the Orinoco, Amazonas, and Parana basins, and the hydrographic networks of the Guianas. The northern limit of its distribution occurs in northern Venezuela, and the southern limit in Misiones, Argentina. The Giant Otter’s range has become discontinuous and fragmented due to local extinctions; the Uruguayan and Argentine populations are extinct or nearly so (Gil pers. comm., Buschiazzo pers. comm.), and the species is reduced to a single, small subpopulation in Paraguay, occupying less than 2% of its former distributional range. It is also extinct to the east of the Tocantins and Paraná basins in Brazil. In the Brazilian Cerrado a population persists in the face of intense habitat modification. Important subpopulations are still found in parts of the Amazon, in the Pantanal region, and, possibly, in the Guianas.","Hunting for the pelt trade was the single, greatest threat to the giant otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazil (Duplaix 1980). The inclusion of the Giant Otter on Appendix I of CITES in 1973, and the coming into force of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended the economic benefits of Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010) and commercial hunting ceased shortly after.

In India, its distribution range has decreased, for example, in the Sundarbans (Sanyal 1991). In Cambodia, it is only found near Virachey National Park (Heng <em>et al</em>. 2016). Given the extent of loss of habitat that is occurring in south and southeast Asia and the intensity of poaching the reduction in population has been observed in many parts of its range (Hussain 1993, Melisch <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1996, Meena 2001, Hussain 2002, Gonzalez 2010, Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2011). Massive destruction of wetland forests in Indonesia has reduced the species’ habitat (Margono<em> et al</em>. 2014), and also habitat conversion to oil palm plantations in Sabah. The threats to Small-clawed Otter are prominent in its western range, so much so that over the last 60 years its range has shrunk considerably moving west to east from Himachal Pradesh to Assam (Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2011). Likewise, in Indochina, the range of the species is shrinking, and hunting appears to play a major role in its rapid decline in the eastern end of its global range. </p>  <p>Although quantitative data on population sizes and trends are lacking, it is suspected that the global population of the Asian Small-clawed Otter has declined by &gt;30% over the past 30 years (three generations, based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). <a name=""_Hlk38804993"">Further aggravation of the ongoing threats to the species, due to lack or failure of adequate conservation and protective measures, </a>may lead to a suspected future decline in population by at least 30% over the next 30 years. In view of these, the species has been listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cde+3cde.</p><p></p>","The typical habitats of the Asian Small-clawed Otter in west Java are wetland systems having pools and stagnant water, including shallow stretches, with depth less than 1 m. These habitats are represented by freshwater swamps, meandering rivers, mangroves and tidal pools. In Western Ghats, India, the species prefers high-altitude areas with stream pools (Perinchery <em>et al.</em> 2011). In southern Western Ghats, India, the species occupied narrow, fast flowing and rocky streams, with dense vegetation and tall grasses on both sides of the bank which provide adequate escape cover (Raha and Hussain 2016). Irrigated rice fields with many crab species (<em>Brachyura</em>) or golden-apple snails (<em>Pomacea canaliculata</em>) are extensively used by the Small-clawed Otter if vegetation cover is ample. These can act as suitable man-made habitats (Melisch <em>et al. </em>1996, Aadrean and Usio 2017). The Small-clawed Otter was common in rice fields adjacent to mangroves along coastal areas in Peninsular Malaysia (Shariff 1985, Nor 1989). In Sabah, they were found to occur in riparian reserves within oil palm plantations neighbouring lowland dipterocarp rainforests (Laws 2016). In Laos, this species was found along main rivers of Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area that is dominated by old growth, dry-evergreen forest (Coudrat 2016). In Thailand, the rapid-flowing upper areas of the Huay Kha Khaeng are dominated by <em>Lutra lutra</em>, the slowly meandering river near the dam and the dam itself were used by <em>Lutrogale perspicillata</em> while the Asian Small-clawed Otter occurred mostly in the middle sections, but also at the upper reaches. When different otter species occurred in the same site there was evidence of difference in use of the habitats. Signs of the of Small-clawed Otter were found wandering further away from the river than the two other species, between patches of reeds and river debris where crabs were more likely to be found (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/> <br/> In west Java, its presence is positively correlated with slow flowing and stagnant broad rivers and smaller streams, depicting a distinct decline in preference from slow to deep-water bodies. On the other hand, they also use shallow fast-flowing mountain creeks narrower than 5 m, particularly when the course of the streams includes natural pools. In rice fields, they chose slow-flowing irrigation channels narrower than 2 m and with a varied, moderate or low vegetation structure. Like Smooth-coated Otter, the Asian Small-clawed Otter avoids bare and open areas that do not offer any shelter (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). It prefers pond areas and rice fields over rivers, whereas it uses mangroves and lakes in proportion to their availability (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). In riverine systems it prefers moderate and low vegetation structure, though their presence was also observed from banks with poor vegetation cover. Neither in ponds nor in rice field areas did they show preference for any of the vegetation structure categories, though poor nor bare structural conditions were the least favoured both in riverine and pond areas and along the rice fields.<br/> <br/> The Small-clawed Otter is adapted to feed on invertebrates as evident from the last two upper teeth (pm4 and m3) which are larger in size for crushing the exoskeleton of crabs and other hard shelled prey. The Small-clawed Otter feeds mainly on crabs, snails and other molluscs, insects and small fish such as gouramis and catfish (Pocock 1941, Wayre 1978, Hon<em> et al.</em> 2010). They supplement their diet with rodents, snakes and amphibians. <br/> <br/> During a study in Malaysia, Foster-Turley (1992) examined 328 scats and found that around 80.8% of the scats consisted of crabs, 77.8% fish, 12.5% insects and 4.0% snails. This is the first study in which quantitative information on the diet of wild small-clawed otter was made. This study revealed that though the small-clawed otter is adapted for an invertebrate diet, it supplements its diet with large quantity of fish. Apart from crabs, the major prey item for small-clawed otter was the mudskipper (<em>Gobioidei</em>). This was recorded in the 48% of the scats. The other important prey were <em>Trichogaster spp</em>. and <em>Anabantidae</em> fish, which were represented in 27.4% scats. As evident from the scats the major fish prey were <em>Trichogaster spp</em> 20.7%, <em>Anabis testudineus</em> 5.2%, <em>Clarius spp </em>2.4% and <em>Channa striatus</em> 1.5%. Apart from these the small-clawed otter in Malaysia also fed on snakes, frogs and insects. Foster-Turley (1992) also examined the diet composition at four different times of the year coinciding with different water levels in the rice fields and concluded that the diet of the small-clawed otter was significantly different at different times of the year. Only the relatively rare dietary components of rodents, snails and snakehead fish (<em>Clarius spp.</em>) showed no significant difference among seasons. Crabs were always the most prevalent food items, but the frequency of occurrence in scats varied from 70.4% to 93.2%. Similarly, though the mudskippers were the second most important food items, they were consumed in significantly different quantities in different seasons ranging from of 27.3% to 63.6%. The amount of <em>Trichogaster</em>, <em>Anabis </em>and the <em>Anbantidae </em>also varied considerably. This difference in the use of these prey are most likely due to difference in the life cycle and availability of these prey at different times of the year.<br/> <br/> Preliminary analysis of the small-clawed otter spraints from west Java showed their preference for crabs in both natural and man-made habitats (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). In 87% of all collected spraints, crabs formed the dominant prey. Remaining part of the spraints consisted of fish bones and scales, ribs and vertebrae, unidentified mammalian hair, shrimps, insects and snake scales. In the Huay Kha Khaeng, Thailand almost 90% of the spraints of small-clawed otter contained remains of crabs <em>Potamon smithianus</em>, whereas 5% scats contained each of Fish and Amphibians. Apart from this, in few spraints, evidences of rodents and other arthropods were also found. Kruuk <em>et al</em>. (1994) estimated the preference for various size classes of crabs eaten by small-clawed otter. Of the 92 scats, 14 scats had crabs of size 10-14 cm, 42 scats had 15-19 cm, 26 had 20-24 cm, 12 had 25-29 cm, 4 had 30-34 and 1 had 40-44 cm. The size distribution of crabs taken by small-clawed otter was similar to what was available, and there was not much evidence for selection of specific size. In west Java a preliminary estimate of preferred size confirmed an average of 3-4 cm carapace width (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). <br/> <br/> The sexual behaviour of small clawed otter has been observed in as young as 18 months old. In captivity, successful breeding has been reported for 2.1 year females and 2.8 year males. The youngest animal to reproduce was a female of 13 months captive born at Bronx Zoo, and the oldest was a 15 years male at the National Zoo, USA (Foster-Turley and Engfer 1988). The duration of oestrous cycle in females ranges from 28 to 30 days, with breeding occurring the year round (Lancaster 1975). Some facilities report this cycle extending to ""every few months"" with older animals. Oestrus lasts from one to thirteen days. Behavioural signs of the onset of oestrus may include increased rubbing and marking. <br/> <br/> In captivity, mating usually takes place in the water, but has also been observed on land on a few occasions. In most cases the exact gestation period could not be ascertained but it is believed to be around 60-86 days (Lancaster 1975, Sobel 1996). The litter size ranges from 2-7. Life span in captivity is around 11 years (Crandall 1964).","<p>Threats to Small-clawed Otter is similar to that of Smooth-coated and Eurasian otters. Throughout Asia, the potential threat to its continued survival is destruction of its habitats due to changing land use pattern in the form of developmental activities. In many parts of Asia, the habitats have been reduced due to reclamation of peat swamp forests and mangroves, aquaculture activities along the intertidal wetlands and loss of hill streams. In India the primary threats are loss of habitats due to tea and coffee plantations along the hills, in the coastal areas it is the loss of mangroves due to aquaculture and increased human settlements and siltation of smaller hill streams due to deforestation. Increased influx of pesticides into the streams from the plantations reduces the quality of the habitats. The threat posed by poaching is still very significant in many parts of India, and SE Asia and will certainly count as a major threat that needs to be constantly monitored. Poaching for pelt has been reported from across the Western Ghats in south India (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012). The growing threat to Small-clawed otters is the illegal pet trade. Small-clawed otters are charismatic and popular attractions in zoos and increasingly in Asian pet shops, pet fairs, and even in coffee shops (Gonzalez 2010, Aadrean 2013, Gomez and Bouhuys 2018). Currently, many of the pet trade has moved online and is difficult to control (Gomez and Bouhuys 2018). In addition, conflict with fish farmers or fishermen also appear as an actual threat.<span lang=""EN-GB""></p>  <p>Another important threat to Asian Small-clawed Otter is reduction in prey biomass due to over-exploitation, which have rendered its remaining natural habitats unsustainable. Pollution is probably the single most important factor causing decline in the population of many fish species (Dehadrai and Ponniah 1997). Reduction in prey biomass affects otter population, and organochlorine pesticides and heavy metal contamination interferes with their normal physiology leading to a decline in population. The threats to Small-clawed Otter is prominent in its western range so much so that since last 60 years its range has shrunk considerable moving west to east from Himachal Pradesh to Assam (Hussain <em>et al</em>. 2011).<span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>","<p>In most of their range the Asian Small-clawed Otter is sympatric with Smooth-coated and Eurasian otters. In India, all three species occur in the Western Ghats and in northeast India, where the small-clawed otters occur in small groups of two to four individuals. In the Western Ghats, similar occupancy has been recorded in protected areas as well as in tea and coffee plantations (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012). They were once common in the mangroves of East Calcutta and Sundarbans (Sanyal 1991). The Asian Small-clawed Otters occur in freshwater and peat swamp forests, rice fields, lakes, streams, reservoirs, canals, mangrove and along the coast (Sivasothi and Nor 1994). In Malaysia and Indonesia, they occur in coastal wetlands, and along the banks of paddy fields (Shariff 1985, Nor 1989, Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). Comparable data from Java, Myanmar, and India revealed that the Asian Small-clawed Otters have a high climatic and trophic adaptability in south and southeast Asian tropics, occurring from coastal wetlands up to mountain streams (Melisch <em>et al.</em>1996). <span lang=""EN-GB""></p>  A reliable population estimate of the Asian Small-clawed Otter is lacking. Around 15 individuals were seen in a group in Malaysia (Wayre 1978), four to eight in coastal Sabah (Mason and Macdonald 1986) and two to four in India. In south China and Cambodia, the population seems to be very small and declining.",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>The Asian Small-clawed Otter has a large distribution range, extending from India in South Asia eastwards through Southeast Asia to Palawan (Philippines), Taiwan and southern China (Mason and Macdonald 1986, Wozencraft 1993, Hussain 2000, Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2011). In India it occurs in West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh as well as in southern Indian hill ranges of Coorg (Karnataka), Ashambu, Nilgiri and Palni hills (Tamil Nadu) and some places in Kerala (Pocock 1941, Prater 1971, Hussain 2000, Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2011). It used to occur in the Western Himalayan foothills (Himachal Pradesh) but recent surveys have not found its evidence (Hussain 2002, Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2011). Its presence has recently been confirmed from several survey sites in Odisha in eastern India (Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2014). This species inhabits in Malay peninsula, Sumatra including small islands in eastern part of Sumatra, Java and Borneo.&#160; It also occurs in all parts of Borneo Sabah, Sarawak and Kalimantan up to 1,300 m on Usun Apau, Sarawak (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). There were records that Asian Small-clawed Otter populations had established in the wild in England after escaping from captivity (Jefferies 1989, 1991).</p><p></p>",For information on Use and Trade see Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>From 1977 to 2019, the Asian Small-clawed Otter had been listed in CITES Appendix II. However, most range countries are not able to control the clandestine trade leading to extensive poaching.&#160; Recently, CITES has up-listed this species to Appendix I. However, over the range of its distribution, the small-clawed otter is still not protected in Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia (except Sabah and Sarawak), Brunei Darussalam and Nepal (Duplaix and Savage 2018).&#160; In India, the species is protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which provides the species with the highest level of protection. The Asian Small-clawed Otter was once common in the streams and wetlands of south and Southeast Asia but is now restricted to a few protected areas. Creation of networks of Protected Areas, identification of sites as wetlands of national and international importance under the Ramsar Convention has, to some extent, halted the degradation of its habitat.<br/> <br/> Over the years the IUCN SSC Otter Specialist Group has developed a cadre of biologists across Asia to conduct field surveys and to popularise otter conservation by promoting otters as ambassadors of the wetlands. However, concerted efforts to conserve this species are needed. For the long-term survival of the species, policy-based action, research on factors affecting its survival, habitat-based action on creation and where required expansion of protected areas, and communication and awareness building actions are needed.<span lang=""EN-GB""></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

There are conservation measures in most regions and established captive breeding programmes, however, habitat loss and illegal hunting remain ongoing threats. For these reasons, <em>C. acutus</em> has been assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd with an inferred population decline of 30% over the last three generations (75 years) because of habitat quality decline and exploitation. </p>  <p>Since its extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are both much greater than the criterion A thresholds, <em>C. acutus </em>does not qualify as threatened under criterion B.

Similarly, <em>C. acutus </em>does not qualify under criterion D (because there are &gt;1,000 individuals).</p>  <p>No quantitative analysis has been conducted, therefore criterion E cannot be applied.</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>The American Crocodile is a large species of crocodilian, with males attaining maximum lengths of 5-6 m, although some individuals may reach 7 m (Schmidt 1924; Medem 1981). Adult females generally measure no more than 3-3.5 m TL, but individuals up to 4.4 m have been reported (Domínguez-Laso 2009). Sexual size dimorphism indices of 2.10, 2.13, 2.09, 2.08, and 2.13 were calculated for populations in coastal Belize and the Caribbean coast of Mexico (Platt <em>et al.</em> 2011; Labarre <em>et al</em>. 2017). Both sexes exhibit a pronounced median pre-orbital ridge (POR) on the skull, which may be sexually dimorphic and appears to vary geographically among <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> populations (Thorbjarnarson 1989; Platt and Rainwater 2005). The American Crocodile is characterized by the most reduced and irregular dorsal armour (osteoderms) of any crocodilian (Ross and Mayer 1983). Inter-populational differences in scalation likely exist in this widely ranging species (Seijas 2002; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2012), and recent studies have also shown high intraspecific variation in the post-occipital, cervical, and dorsal scalation, allowing for individual identification (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2017). Population-specific size estimation models for <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> are available for Belize (Platt <em>et al.</em> 2011), Mexico (Labarre <em>et al.</em> 2017), and Coiba Island, Panama (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018b). &#160;</p>  <p>The habitat of <em>C. acutus </em>consists largely of brackish water coastal habitats such as the saltwater sections of rivers, coastal lagoons, and mangrove swamps. <em>Crocodylus acutus</em> inhabits offshore cays (islands) and atolls where it survives under true marine conditions (Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000a; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2013; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2005; González Cortés 2007; Venegas-Anaya <em>et al</em>. 2015). Populations are also known from freshwater habitats located well inland, including a number of reservoirs (Medem 1981; Mandujano-Camacho and Rodas-Trejo 2010; Sigler 2010; Espinal and Escobedo-Galván 2011). A significant population inhabits Lago Enriquillo, a landlocked hypersaline lake situated 40 m below sea level in the arid southwestern Dominican Republic (Schubert 2002). A robust population also inhabits Cayo Centro, an island in Banco Chinchorro atoll located 50 km from southern coast of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. During the dry season, lagoons on Cayo Centro can experience extremely hypersaline conditions (up to 61 ppt; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;&#160;</p>  <p>Knowledge on&#160;<em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> has increased rapidly over the few past decades, and much research has been conducted on reproductive ecology (Platt and Thorbjarnarson 1997, 2000b; Mazzotti <em>et al</em>. 2007a; Charruau <em>et al.</em> 2010a, 2011; 2017a; Escobedo-Galván <em>et al.</em> 2019; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2014a; Charruau 2012; Charruau and Hénaut 2012; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al.</em> 2015a; Murray <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016; González-Desales <em>et al.</em> 2016; Ferguson <em>et al.</em> 2017; Gómez-González <em>et al.</em> 2017), nutrition, diet, and foraging ecology (Platt <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2013a, b, 2014b, Richards and Wasilewski 2003; Gómez Hernández 2004; Cupul-Magaña <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2015; Villegas and Schmitter-Soto 2008; Ávila Cervantes <em>et al</em>. 2017; Hernández-Hurtado <em>et al.</em> 2018; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al.</em> 2018a; Triminio <em>et al.</em> 2019), morphometrics (Domínguez-Laso 2009; Platt <em>et al</em>. 2011; Platt and Rainwater 2005; Rainwater <em>et al.</em> 2010; Domínguez-Laso 2017; Labarre <em>et al.</em> 2017), scalation (Seijas 2002; Platt <em>et al</em>. 2012; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al.</em> 2017; Boucher <em>et al.</em> 2017; English 2017), growth (Pérez and Escobedo-Galván 2009; Charruau 2011; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2010b; García-Grajales <em>et al</em>. 2012, Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015a), movement and spatial ecology (Wheatley <em>et al</em>. 2012; Cherkiss <em>et al</em>. 2014; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2016; Beauchamp <em>et al.</em> 2018; Farlow <em>et al</em>. 2018a, b; Beauchamp <em>et al.</em> 2019), population genetics (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2004; Cedeño-Vázquez <em>et al</em>. 2008; Porras Murillo <em>et al</em>. 2008; Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011; Weaver <em>et al</em>. 2008; Machkour-M’Rabet <em>et al</em>. 2009; Milián-García <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015; González-Trujillo <em>et al</em>. 2012; Bashyal <em>et al</em>. 2014; Bloor <em>et al</em>. 2015, Budd <em>et al</em>. 2015; Hekkala <em>et al</em>. 2015; Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2016; Serrano-Gómez <em>et al</em>. 2016; Mauger <em>et al</em>. 2017; Milián-García <em>et al.</em> 2018a, b; Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2018), behavior in captivity (Benko and Perc 2009); physiology and biochemistry (Merchant <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b), parasitology and bacteriology (Villegas and Gonzáles-Solís 2009; Pérez-Flores <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2017; Tellez and Paquet-Durand 2011; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2016, 2017b; Escobedo-Galván <em>et al.</em> 2012; Charruau and González-Muñoz 2015; Rainwater <em>et al.</em> 2015; Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2019), ecotoxicology (Wu <em>et al</em>. 2000; Rainwater <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2011; Charruau <em>et al.</em> 2013; Murray <em>et al.</em> 2017), and conflict with humans (Barrantes 2010; Cupul-Magaña <em>et al.</em> 2010; Balaguera-Reina 2012, 2013; Bolaños Montero, 2012; García-Grajales and Buenrstro-Silva 2013; García-Grajales <em>et al</em>. 2013; Carrillo-Rivera and Porras-Murillo 2014; Ponce-Campos 2014; Balaguera-Reina and Farfán-Ardila 2018; García-Grajales and Buenrostro-Silva 2018, 2019).</p>  <p><em>Crocodylus acutus </em>is a hole-nesting species, but adaptable in terms of nesting ecology, in some areas creating elevated mounds of substrate into which eggs are deposited (Thorbjarnarson 1989; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 1997; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000b; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2011). Clutch size is typically 30 to 60 eggs, although in some populations mean clutch size is in the low 20s (Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000b, Sigler 2010; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015a) or less (i.e. &lt;17 at Banco Chinchorro; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2010a). As with most hole nesting species of crocodilians, <em>C. acutus </em>nests during the annual dry season, with eggs hatching around the beginning of the annual wet season (Thorbjarnarson 1989; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000b, Sigler 2010; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015a; Casas-Andreu 2003; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2011; González-Desales <em>et al</em>. 2016). A somewhat different pattern occurs in Banco Chinchorro atoll where the population has adapted to local conditions. Females nest at the end of the dry season and hatching occurs during the middle of the wet season, thus representing a compromise between the risk of flooding and increasing the availability of freshwater for hatchlings (Charruau <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Most nest failures are attributed to predation, nest abandonment, desiccation, flooding, and low temperatures associated with heavy rainfall (Mazzotti 1989; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000b; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2010a). The American Crocodile is adept at using man-made areas for nesting, and this is one of the reasons behind population recovery in parts of its range (Mazzotti <em>et al</em>. 2007a, 2009; Ulloa Delgado 2012; McCann <em>et al</em>. 2016; Mazzotti <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;</p>  <p>Similar to most crocodilians, <em>C. acutus </em>is a dietary generalist that consumes a wide variety of prey such as invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2013a; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018a). In offshore, marine habitats of Belize, Mexico (Quintana Roo), and Panama, the diet consists largely of marine invertebrates, particularly various species of crabs, but also corals, gastropods, and bivalves (Platt <em>et al</em>., 2013a, Ávila Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2017; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018a). Fruit and vegetation are occasionally consumed by <em>C. acutus</em>, although the dietary significance of frugivory is poorly understood (Platt <em>et al</em>., 2013b, 2014b). <em>Crocodylus acutus</em> exhibits the typical ontogenetic dietary shift with smaller size-classes consuming mostly invertebrates and larger individuals taking increasing amounts of vertebrate prey (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2013a; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018a). &#160;</p>  <p>Studies on the population ecology of <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> have been carried out in Belize (Platt <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2004; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000a; Platt 2003; Rainwater and Platt 2009, 2013; Chenot-Rose and Rose 2013; Platt and Rainwater 2014, Tellez <em>et al</em>. 2016), Colombia (Balaguera-Reina and Gonzalez-Maya 2008; Ulloa Delgado 2011; Balaguera-Reina 2012; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015b, 2016; Espinosa <em>et al</em>. 2012, Viloria-Largares <em>et al</em>. 2017), Costa Rica (Bolaños Montero, 2012; Mauger <em>et al</em>. 2012), Cuba (Rodríguez Soberón <em>et al</em>. 2002), Dominican Republic (Schubert 2002; Powell and Incháustegui 2009), Ecuador (Carvajal <em>et al</em>. 2005), Haiti (Thorbjarnarson 1988), Honduras (Espinal and Escobedo-Galván 2011), Jamaica (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012), Mexico (Cupul-Magaña <em>et al</em>. 2004; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2005; Cedeño-Vázquez <em>et al</em>. 2006; Hernández-Hurtado <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2011; Brandon-Pliego 2007; García-Grajales <em>et al</em>. 2007; González Cortés 2007; Sigler 2011; Garcia-Grajales and Buenrostro-Silva 2017), Panama (Venegas-Anaya <em>et al</em>. 2015, Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018b), the United States (Florida) (Ogden 1978, Kushlan and Mazzotti 1989a,b; Moler 1991; Moler and Abercrombie 1992; Mazzotti <em>et al</em>. 2007b; Cherkiss <em>et al</em>. 2011; Green <em>et al</em>. 2014; Lorenz 2014; Briggs-Gonzalez&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2017), and Venezuela (Seijas 1988).</p>  <p>Recent genetic studies have confirmed that significant hybridization is occurring between <em>C. acutus </em>and <em>C. moreletii </em>in Belize (Hekkala 2004; Ray <em>et al</em>. 2004; Hekkala <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Mexico (Cedeño-Vázquez <em>et al. </em>2008; Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2008; Machkour-M’Rabet <em>et al</em>. 2009; Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2016) as well as with <em>C. rhombifer </em>in Cuba (Weaver <em>et al</em>. 2008; Milián-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015). The ecological and evolutionary consequences of this hybridization are poorly understood but are a priority for future work.</p><p></p>","<p>This species was hunted and overexploited for its hides in the 1930s until it was protected in the 1970s, however, illegal hunting still occurs. It is also threatened by habitat degradation from coastal development, including destruction of nesting grounds and the destruction of mangrove swamps for shrimp aquaculture. In the Dominican Republic, overharvesting of fish has contributed to the declines of this species (Ross 1998). When young, individuals of this species may also be predated by crabs, birds, raccoons, coaties, dogs, and by adult crocodiles (i.e., cannibalism). For a summary of the conservation and research actions receommended for this species, see the Conservation Actions section.<br/></p>","<p></p><p>The American Crocodile is found in 18 countries in the northern Neotropics (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). As <em>Crocodylus acutus </em>produces a commercially valuable skin, the principal reason for past declines in population size can be attributed to the extensive commercial overexploitation that occurred from the 1930s into the 1970s (Medem 1981, Thorbjarnarson 1989). The current threats are habitat loss and degradation, fishing nets, illegal hunting and hybridization. A review of the conservation status and distribution of <em>C. acutus </em>throughout its range conducted in the early 2000s (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006) concluded populations were recovering in most parts of its historic range. There were a few areas where population recovery appeared to be limited (e.g., Colombia), or non-existent (e.g., Ecuador), but populations of <em>C. acutus </em>in areas such as Cuba, USA, Mexico, and Costa Rica appear to be healthy and robust.</p>  <p>It was estimated that by 2002, <em>C. acutus </em>had been extirpated from 8.9% of its historical range (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, there is also evidence that the species is re-colonizing the one country from which it had been extirpated (Cayman Islands) with three individuals being sighted over a period of 12 months in 2008 and 2009 (Echternacht <em>et al.</em> 2011;&#160;M. DaCosta-Cottam, pers. comm. 2018). The review by Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>(2006) quantified the information available at the time and classified 69 areas in eight distinct crocodile bioregions as Crocodile Conservation Units (CCUs), defined as the most important areas for the conservation of <em>C. acutus</em>. The relative importance of the CCUs in each bioregion was quantified using an algorithm that weighted factors that experts on <em>C. acutus</em> considered to be most important for the long-term conservation of viable populations. In particular, two bioregions were identified where the creation of protected areas should be given a high priority: 1) Dry Pacific South America (northern Peru and southern Ecuador) and 2) Northwest and Central Pacific Mexico.</p>  <p><u><strong>North America</strong> </u></p>  <p>In the U.S.A., <em>C. acutus </em>is restricted to the southernmost, subtropical tip of the state of Florida. Since the 1970s, when it was first listed as Endangered under the US Endangered Species Act, the population has steadily increased (Mazzotti <em>et al. </em>2007a,b) and in 2007 <em>C. acutus</em> was officially reclassified as Threatened (Stansell 2007) reflecting the successful population recovery. Today, one of the most significant sources of mortality for crocodiles in Florida is road mortality (Brien <em>et al. </em>2008). In addition, a significant mortality event involving <em>C. acutus</em> occurred in Florida in 2010 as a result of an unprecedented period of cold weather (Mazzotti <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>Along the Pacific coast of Mexico,&#160;American crocodiles are found in areas of suitable habitat along the Pacific coast of Mexico from the Guatemalan border to the State of Sinaloa (Alvarez del Toro 1974, Sigler 2002, Muñiz 2004). Specific reports are available from&#160;the States of&#160;Jalisco (Huerta Ortega <em>et al. </em>2002; Cupul-Magaña <em>et al. </em>2002), Sinaloa (Navarro Serment 2003), and Oaxaca (Brandon-Pliego 2007). The three top priority CCUs in this bioregion were either coastal habitats characterized by relatively small mangrove areas that are typically associated with the mouths of rivers (Jalisco-Colima coast), or coastal lagoon/mangrove complexes with very seasonal inputs of freshwater (Bahía de Petacalco and&#160;Oaxaca coast) (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>2006). Crocodiles are widespread in these patchy habitats, with animals being found in 38 of 52 water bodies along the Jalisco coast (P. Ponce-Campos and S. Huerta-Ortega, pers. comm. 2018). Crocodiles are also known from inland reservoirs (Presa Adolfo López Mateos, also identified as CCU) as well as in freshwater sections of some of the region’s larger rivers (Rio Santiago CCU). Human-crocodile conflict is a growing problem in the Pacific region (Huerta Ortega and Ponce Campos 2002; Cupul-Magaña <em>et al.</em> 2010; García-Grajales and Buenrostro-Silva 2018, 2019). An initiative from the Mexican Government through the National Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) called “SOS crocodile” has identified a team in each region of the country to respond to incidents of human-crocodile conflict, gather information on the event, and take action to mitigate the problem (SEMARNAT 2018). Hybridization with non-native <em>C</em>. <em>moreletii</em> that became established after escaping from commercial crocodile farms potentially threatens the genetic integrity of <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> in some areas along the Pacific coast (Serrano-Gómez <em>et al</em>. 2016, Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2018). Along the Yucatan mainland of Mexico there is extensive hybridization between <em>C. moreletii </em>and <em>C. acutus </em>(Cedeño-Vázquez <em>et al. </em>2008; Rodriguez <em>et al. </em>2008; Machkour-M’Rabet <em>et al. </em>2009; Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2018), while the island populations on Cozumel and Banco Chinchorro remain genetically pure (Machkour-M’Rabet <em>et al. </em>2009, Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2016). An isolated population of <em>C. acutus </em>occurs in the Rio Grijalva, the only known Gulf of Mexico drainage where the species is present. In the Grijalva drainage, crocodiles inhabit a series of freshwater reservoirs, as well as riverine habitats between reservoirs (Sigler 2002, Mandujano Camacho 2003).</p>  <p>On the island of Hispaniola, a few small coastal populations of crocodiles were reported in Haiti by Thorbjarnarson (1988), but by far the largest populations were in two landlocked lakes, Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic and Etang Saumatre in Haiti. Lago Enriquillo is an unusual habitat, a hypersaline lake well below sea level, and crocodile populations have fluctuated widely since the 1980s as a result of changes in lake salinity and illegal hunting (Schubert and Santana 1996). Thorbjarnarson (1989) reported on the population in Etang Saumâtre in Haiti and some other coastal locations, but systematic surveys were last conducted in Haiti during the mid-1980s. More recent informal surveys indicate the population in Etang Saumatre is greatly reduced (A. Schubert, pers. comm. 2018).</p>  <p>Up until the late 2000s, American Crocodiles in Jamaica were reasonably abundant in areas along the southern coast. However, since that time coastal development appears to have destroyed many of the fragile wetland habitats and nesting areas used by crocodiles, and the situation regarding <em>C. acutus</em> in Jamaica now appears dire (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012). As of 2012, crocodiles remained in small numbers, widely distributed among small and isolated habitat patches primarily in the Black River Morass, central southern coast, and far eastern marshes and canals (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012). Crocodile numbers are declining due to continued habitat loss, persecution and illegal harvest for meat (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012). Real potential for the extirpation of <em>C. acutus</em> in Jamaica exists in the foreseeable future if current trends continue and more effective intervention is not developed (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>Populations of <em>C. acutus </em>in Cuba are widespread and locally abundant (Rodríguez Soberón <em>et al. </em>2006, Milián-García <em>et al.</em> 2018b). In 2007 Cuba became the first country to successfully petition CITES for a transfer of its <em>C. acutus </em>population to Appendix II, based on a program of managed use that includes ranching and closed-cycle captive breeding.</p>  <p><strong><u>Central America</u></strong></p>  <p>The American Crocodile in Belize is largely competitively excluded from inland, freshwater habitats by the sympatric <em>C</em>. <em>moreletii</em> and therefore restricted to the coastal zone (Platt and Thorbjarnarson 1997, 2000a,c). &#160;The most important populations are found on offshore islands, particularly the Turneffe and Lighthouse atolls (Platt <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2004; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000a; Platt 2003; Rainwater and Platt 2009, 2013; Chenot-Rose and Rose 2013; Platt and Rainwater 2014; Tellez and Boucher 2018). Hybridization between <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> and <em>C</em>. <em>moreletii</em> appears common along the coast of mainland Belize (Hekkala 2004, Ray <em>et al</em>. 2004, Hekkala <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>In the 1980s and 1990s,&#160;<em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> populations were reported to be greatly depleted in Guatemala (Enrique Fernández, pers. comm. 2018) but there is little new information from this country. Crocodiles are similarly rare in El Salvador. Spotlight surveys by Escobedo-Galván <em>et al. </em>(2004) in some of the best remaining coastal habitats observed 28 crocodiles, mostly juveniles, over a total of 157.5 km (encounter rate = 0.17 crocodiles/km). In Honduras, most of the major rivers of the Atlantic drainage support small populations although most appear depleted (King <em>et al. </em>1990). Surveys by Cerrato (2002) in northern coastal Honduras in wetlands associated with the Laguna Guaimoreto, Rio Chapagua, Laguna El Lirio and the lower 15 km of the Rio Aguan reported a mean encounter rate of two crocodiles/km, which represents an increase from similar surveys conducted in the same area in 1989. Perhaps the largest crocodile population in Honduras is located in the El Cajon Reservoir where 1,082 crocodiles were counted including a large number of hatchlings (536) which confirms successful reproduction (Espinal 2005, Espinal and Escobedo-Galván 2011). Crocodiles are also known to be breeding in some of the Bay Islands off the northern coast of Honduras (Kaiser <em>et al. </em>2001).</p>  <p>Surveys in Nicaragua by King <em>et al. </em>(1994) reported <em>C. acutus </em>as rare but persisting in the Atlantic drainage while several viable populations were identified on the Pacific coast (Estero Real, Las Salinas) and near Managua. A similar conclusion was made by Buitrago (2000, 2001). Incidental illegal take of crocodiles in association with the legal caiman harvest is a problem (Buitrago 2001). In Costa Rica, a low density of crocodiles is found in wetlands along the Atlantic coast, although larger density populations are reported in mangroves swamps and rivers along the Pacific coast (Bolaños Montero 2012). A population of over 300 individuals was reported from the Rio Grande de Tarcoles (Sasa and Chaves 1992) and another of about 35 individuals in Estero Roto (Chaves Cordero 1993). Moderate encounter rates (crocodiles/km of survey route) were recorded in the Rio Chirripó at La Rambla de Sarapiquí (2.33), Golfo de Nicoya (1.93) and mangrove wetlands associated with the Terraba and Sierpe rivers (2.28) (Bolaños Montero <em>et al.</em> 1997). Substantial populations of crocodiles are also known from the Rio Tempisque (Sánchez 2001; Bolaños Montero, 2012) and the vicinity of the Osa Peninsula (Boston <em>et al. </em>2005) so it is likely that crocodiles occupying habitat patches along the Pacific coast function as a metapopulation (Porras 2007). Growing populations of crocodiles and people have resulted in several instances of human-crocodile conflict including fatal attacks (Ross and Larriera 2001; Bolaños Montero, 2012). In Panama, a long-term study on Coiba Island has revealed new information on the population genetics (Bashyal <em>et al</em>. 2014) as well as reproductive (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015), spatial (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2016), trophic (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018a), and population ecology (Venegas-Anaya <em>et al.</em> 2015,&#160;Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018b) of American Crocodiles inhabiting insular areas. An estimated population size of ~200 non-hatchlings on the southern tip of the island (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018b) highlights the importance of Coiba Island as an American Crocodile hotspot and fertile locality for research on the natural history of the species.</p>  <p>In the regional analysis carried out by Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>(2006), the highest priority CCUs in the Caribbean drainage of Central America are three very different habitats: 1) an extensive region of eastern Nicaragua containing a vast complex of coastal lagoons and rivers that extend inland (Costa Miskito and Rio Coco), 2) a section of the largest lake in Central America (Lago de Nicaragua), and 3) a region of central Caribbean Panama that includes the enormous Gatun Lake Reservoir (Bahía de Panama-Este). The second level of priority CCUs is represented by a large river (Rio San Juan, Nicaragua), an extensive coastal lagoon complex (Laguna de Chiriqui, Panama) and a large reservoir (Embalse El Cajón, Honduras). Along the Pacific coast, the highest priority CCUs are patches of coastal mangrove and short sections of estuarine rivers. Puerto Sandino is a tidal mangrove complex that receives fresh water from the Izapa and Tamarindo Rivers. The Estero Real is the largest estuarine system of the Golfo de Fonseca and is in the driest region of Nicaragua, receiving less than 500 mm of rain annually. This CCU is comprised principally of a mangrove forest within which a number of commercial shrimp farms have been established, causing significant damage to the ecosystem. Isla Coiba in Panama is a national park comprised of 40 islands in Veraguas Province. There are also robust populations of <em>C. acutus </em>associated with rivers and coastal mangroves on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica (Rio Terraba, Rio Tempisque) that were rated at the second CCU priority level.</p>  <p><strong><u>South America</u></strong></p>  <p>American Crocodile numbers in Colombia are increasing and new populations have been discovered throughout the country. This facilitated the down-listing of the species from “Critically Endangered” to “Endangered” in the most recent local assessment (Morales-Betancourt <em>et al</em>. 2015). Healthy populations have been reported in Portete and Cispatá Bay, Puerto Badel (Arjona municipality), Dibulla, Tayrona Natural National Park, and in the Sardinata, San Miguel, Nuevo Presidente and Tibu rivers of the Caribbean region. However, a paucity of information still exists for areas such as the Pacific and Andean regions with only 37% of the national territories included in ecological studies during the last decade (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Community-based conservation programs in two areas of the Colombian Caribbean coast have provided the most detailed information on the conservation status of <em>C. acutus</em>. In the Cispatá Bay region (Ulloa Delgado 2004, 2005; Ulloa Delgado and Sierra Díaz 2002, 2006), a group of 15 ex-hunters, known as “caimaneros” are active participants in a program for the conservation of <em>C. acutus</em>. This community group formed ASOCAIMAN (Asociación para la Conservación de los Caimanes de la Bahía de Cispatá) with its main objective being the conservation of <em>C. acutus</em>. Aside from increasing the protection of crocodiles, the project has included the creation of artificial nesting beaches in the mangroves of Cispatá Bay and coupled with the head-starting of juvenile crocodiles. &#160;A somewhat similar community-based program to protect crocodiles, crocodile nests, and head-start crocodiles is underway in the Portete Bay in northeastern Colombia (Gómez <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160;In Venezuela, crocodiles are known from a number of coastal areas and river systems along the Caribbean coast. Restocking with ranched stock has been conducted in Falcon Province in the northeast of the country (Arteaga 1993; Velasco 2004; Velasco and Lander 1998) and in Aragua Province (Lander <em>et al</em>. 1994; Velasco 2004). These are the most important populations, with an active conservation program that includes surveys and monitoring. Comparative surveys between 1986 and 1993 suggest that populations in several locations are stable or growing as a result of protection and restocking, although residual problems of illegal killing for medicinal products is reported (Arteaga 1994). De Sola <em>et al. </em>(2004) and Lander and Bermudez (2005) reported on surveys around the Venezuelan coast and demonstrated that in some areas the status of populations have improved since previous surveys. Velasco <em>et al. </em>(2000) prepared a National Recovery Plan for <em>C. acutus</em> in Venezuela and Villarroel <em>et al. </em>(2005) presented the results of a workshop evaluating the Venezuelan <em>C. acutus </em>population and habitats, and proposed 11 CCUs for the country. All three highest priority CCUs along the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Colombia are coastal lagoon systems (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>2006). Two of the three proposed CCUs are mangrove systems in seasonally dry areas, one in Colombia (Alta Guajira, comprised of the Bahía Portete and Bahía Hondita), and one in Venezuela (Laguna Tacarigua). The Bahía Cispatá CCU is an extensive mangrove swamp associated with the old delta of the Rio Sinú. The second priority level of CCUs includes additional habitat types such as an inland, freshwater riverine site in dry forest habitat (Rio Bache, Colombia) over 1200 km from the coast, a coastal river/lagoon/reservoir complex (Yaracuy and Aroa rivers), as well a reservoir (Embalse Pueblo Viejo).</p>  <p>One of the areas where populations of <em>C. acutus </em>are most threatened is along the Pacific coast of South America. In Ecuador, crocodiles were formerly abundant in the Rio Guayas system but appear to have been all but extirpated (although population surveys are needed for confirmation). A small number of crocodiles remain in the coastal region of the Gulf of Guayaquil (Carvajal <em>et al. </em>2005; Carvajal and Alava 2005) but coastal mangrove destruction for the construction of shrimp aquaculture facilities is removing critical crocodile habitat. A small population remains in the Rio Tumbes region of northern Peru, at the southernmost limit of the species’ range (Trelancia 2001). Two areas were identified as CCUs (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>2006) with both associated with the Rio Tumbes drainage forming the geopolitical boundary between Peru and Ecuador. The Amotape CCU is a freshwater section of the Tumbes in a region of dry forest with few human pressures. The Estero Corrales is a tidal mangrove system associated with the Tumbes delta complex and adjacent to a protected area (Santuario de los Manglares) but nonetheless threatened by shrimp aquaculture and rice farming.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p>The American Crocodile is the most widely distributed of the New World crocodiles and&#160;found in 18 countries in the northern Neotropics (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). Its range extends&#160;from the southern tip of Florida (USA), along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America, as well as the Caribbean islands of Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola (Groombridge 1987, Kushlan 1988, Thorbjarnarson <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;An isolated subpopulation is found in the Rio Grijalva basin in Mexico. Along the Pacific coast, it extends from northern Sinaloa in Mexico to the limits of mangrove coastal habitats in northern Peru.</p>","<p></p><p>As <em>C. acutus</em> produces a commercially valuable skin, there has been interest in commercial utilization programs. Commercial farms in Honduras and Colombia have been registered with CITES as captive breeding operations (one and seven, respectively). Commercial global exports of <em>C. acutus</em> skins have increased from 120 in 2006 to 3,403 in 2015 (Caldwell 2017). With the recent down-listing of its <em>C. acutus</em> population to CITES Appendix II, Cuba and Bahía Cispatá in Colombia are developing plans for exports based on commercial farming and ranching. Illegal hunting of this species still occurs for its hides in some regions but the conservation effects are most likely negligible.</p><p></p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><p>A review of the status and distribution of <em>C. acutus</em> throughout its range was carried out by Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. (2006) and found the species to be recovering in most parts of its historic range. There were a few areas where population recovery appears to be limited (e.g. Colombia), or non-existent (e.g. Ecuador), but populations of <em>C. acutus</em> in areas such as Cuba, the USA and Costa Rica appear to be very healthy.</p>  <p>There are management measures in place in all countries where this species occurs, with the exception of El Salvador and Haiti. However, enforcement of protection is lacking and urgently needed, since illegal hunting remains a threat (Ross 1998). There are protected areas and sanctuaries for this species as well as captive breeding programmes and a few commercial farming operations are established. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES in most range states, and Appendix II in Mexico, Cuba and the Cispatá Bay population in Colombia. Further research into the population, habitat requirements, and threats to this species should be carried out, and population monitoring is recommended.<br/></p><p><strong><u>High priority</u></strong></p>  <p>Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. (2006) listed a number of specific areas containing some of the most important populations of <em>C. acutus</em>,  and where greater habitat protection is needed. From this list, three  areas have been selected here as the highest priority for conservation  action.</p>  <p>1. <strong>Conservation in Peru and Ecuador</strong>: The Guayas River system in Ecuador historically supported a large population of <em>C. acutus</em>,  which appears to have all but disappeared following intensive  commercial hunting and habitat destruction in the 20th century. Surveys  are needed to determine if crocodiles still remain in the Guayas River,  and to develop population recovery plans. The small population in the  Tumbes area of northern Peru is also extremely vulnerable. Preliminary  studies suggest that the <em>C. acutus </em>in Ecuador/Peru are  genetically distinct from other populations (M. Anaya-Venegas, pers.  comm. 2018). Therefore, the genetic status of these populations merits  further investigation.</p>  <p>2. <strong>Population evaluation and conservation in the Magdalena/Cauca River basin</strong>:  Crocodiles are reported from several areas in the Magdalena/Cauca River  basin up to 1200 km from the coast. This area is considered a high  priority not only due to the lack of information and apparent endangered  population status, but also because of the extraordinary riverine  nature of the crocodiles. In a 2004 review by the CSG (Larriera <em>et al. </em>2005), the implementation of a national program for rebuilding depleted populations of <em>C. acutus </em>was  seen as a major priority and could be promoted by better linkage of  commercial crocodile farming operations in Colombia with <em>ex-situ </em>conservation efforts (Larriera <em>et al. </em>2005). However, these actions have not yet been carried out in Colombia, threatening the future of these populations.</p>  <p>3. <strong>Development of a conservation program in Jamaica</strong>:  American Crocodile numbers continue to decline in Jamaica due to  habitat loss, persecution, and illegal harvest for meat consumption  (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012). Extirpation of the species in the country is likely unless effective conservation measures are taken (Henriques <em>et al</em>.  2012). A continued nation-wide population evaluation, habitat  assessment, and monitoring and education program is needed as a  foundation towards developing a crocodile conservation plan for Jamaica.</p>  <p><strong><u>Moderate priority</u></strong></p>  <p>4. <strong>Genetic evaluations</strong>:  The American Crocodile is a wide-ranging and ecologically plastic  species. Genetic evidence to date suggests there are substantial genetic  differences among populations in different parts of the species’ range.  American Crocodiles are known to hybridize with <em>C. moreletii </em>and <em>C. rhombifer</em>; however, the evolutionary implications of this hybridization are poorly understood, and further investigation is warranted.</p>  <p>5.<strong> Population status in the Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Haiti</strong>: Recent information on the status of <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em>  in the Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Haiti is sparse or  lacking. Crocodile surveys in these countries are needed to assess  population numbers, availability and quality of habitat, and current  threats so that appropriate conservation and management plans can be  developed.&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p>  6. <strong>Investigations on ecology and population biology</strong>:  Although the American Crocodile has been well-studied in certain areas  of its range, we still know relatively little about its ecology,  population dynamics and behaviour in the wild. Information on these and  other aspects of the life history of <em>C. acutus</em> (e.g., genetic  diversity, movement patterns, habitat use, physiology) would benefit the  overall management of the species and assist decision-makers dealing  with problem animals and human-crocodile conflict.<p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The species has relatively low biological productivity. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline and demersal trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Steep declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 254 reefs in 40 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 59.2% over three generation lengths (44 years). Therefore, the Grey Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of  50–79% over the last three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation  and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The Grey Reef Shark is found in clear tropical waters from the surface to depths of around 280 m (Last and Stevens 2009) and is common around coral reefs, particularly near drop-offs and fringing coral reefs. Its distribution is patchy in continental shelf waters. It attains a maximum size of 255 cm total length (TL), males mature at 110–145 cm TL and females mature at 120–142 cm TL (Wetherbee&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1997,&#160;Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and small litters of 1–6 pups, a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 48–49 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Last and Stevens 2009, Wetherbee&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1997).&#160;Smart<em> et al.</em> (2016) provide age data from Papua New Guinea where the females mature at 9 years, and Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2006) showed they reach a maximum age of at least 20 years on the Great Barrier Reef. Based on these data, generation length is estimated to be 14.5 years.","<p>The Grey Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scale&#160;longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs. There is little species specific information on catches. Most is taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. However, it is occasionally taken in industrial scale fisheries. For example, Grey Reef Shark made up 4.2% (by number) of the sharks caught by the Papua New Guinea Shark Longline Fishery, making it the second most commonly caught species (White <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is often retained for its meat, fins, and liver. The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries.&#160;In Indonesia it makes up 0.1% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter <em>et al</em>. In press).&#160;While in Fiji, Grey Reef Shark makes up 6.3% (by number) of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus <em>et al</em>. 2015). In many parts of east Africa, and south and southeast Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and it continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al</em>. 2009), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.&#160;</p><p>This is a common display species in public and private aquaria.

Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.</p><p>&#160;</p>","Genetic and telemetry studies support an isolation by distance model of population structure (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2015, Momigliano <em>et al</em>. 2017) that result in significant structuring in the population. A lack of sampling throughout its range means the number and boundaries of these populations cannot yet be determined. There are numerous accounts of population trends for individual locations throughout its range. Many of these accounts have demonstrated substantial declines in abundance. This includes Chagos Archipelago where Graham <em>et al</em>. (2010) estimated that the reef shark population, including Grey Reef Sharks, had declined by 90% between 1976 and 2005 based on diver surveys. However, Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2018) reconstructed shark populations at this location and concluded that Grey Reef Sharks had in fact recovered at this location to be at 79% of their original abundance. In the Pacific Ocean, Nadon <em>et al</em>. (2012) used manta tow data from 15 locations and found that Grey Reef Shark populations far from human populations (Jarvis Reef, Phoenix Islands, Line Islands, Johnston Atoll, Wake Island, Northwest Hawaiian Islands and western and northern Mariana Islands) were close to their carrying capacity, while those close to human populations (Hawaii (main islands), American Samoa and southern Mariana Islands) were heavily depleted (&lt;3% of carrying capacity). On Australia's Great Barrier Reef there are varying reports of population decline and recovery. Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2006) reported that Grey Reef Sharks were suffering from ongoing collapse, with annual declines of between 7 and 17%. However, subsequent research has shown that populations have not declined as dramatically as first estimated (Heupel <em>et al.</em> 2009), and Espinoza <em>et al</em>. (2014) demonstrating that rezoning of the reef had led to increasing abundance in areas protected from fishing.&#160;<br/><br/>To account for differences in the trends of Grey Reef Sharks between locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed from the Global Finprint project that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range. This is the largest and most recent data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimated depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef-level depletion estimates were aggregated, weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area), to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Grey Reef Sharks was estimated as 59.2% (standard error 51.9–66.5%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (434 years) (see Supplementary Information). As such it is concluded, based on the Global Finprint data that the Grey Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% in the last  three generation lengths (44 years).<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Grey Reef Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-West and Central Pacific Oceans, and also occur in some parts of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (Last and Stevens 2009).","<p>This is species is retained for its meat, fins, liver and skin.

Marine Protected Areas are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is also known to occur around and within mangrove forests, which may be used as nursery grounds. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and demersal trawl. This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality; and mangroves from deforestation and coastal development. While there is limited species-specific data available, it is likely to have undergone declines based on its large size and presumably low productivity, and intensive coastal fisheries through much of its range. Landings surveys, dive surveys, diver interviews, and anecdotal evidence indicate substantial declines over the past three generations lengths (50 years). Results from baited remote underwater video system surveys of coral reefs across its range (242 reefs in 36 nations) indicate that the species has declined to very low levels through much of its range in Asia and Africa, but remains common in Australia, and in some island nations of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is estimated that the Sharptooth Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (50 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark&#160;is demersal in shallow inshore and offshore waters at depths to at least 90 m and is often found on and around coral reefs and on sandy plateaus near coral (Stevens 1984, Compagno 1998, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). It is also known to occur around and within the mangrove forests in certain areas, which may be used as nursery grounds (Bonfil 2003). It reaches a maximum size of 340 cm total length (TL), males and females mature at 220–240 cm TL (Compagno <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 6-12 pups (average 9.3), a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 60 cm TL. The generation length is suspected to be around 16.5 years, similar to that of the Lemon Shark (<em>Negaprion brevirostris</em>) which reaches a similar&#160;maximum&#160;size (Brown and Gruber 1988).","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark is caught throughout much of its range in industrial and small-scale longline, gillnet, trawl, and handline fisheries that occur in coastal waters, including around coral reefs and mangrove habitats. It is retained for the meat and fins where possible. There is little data available on the capture of this species in fisheries of island nations in the Pacific Ocean where the species show little trend in population size. Throughout the coastal waters of Asia, it is caught in gillnets, longlines, trawls and handlines and landed. However, in recent years it has rarely been reported in surveys of landings sites. For example, Winter <em>et al</em>. (2020) reported a single individual in landings at Muncar in Indonesia in a 9 month period in 2017–2018. Similar levels of paucity of catch are reported in Thailand (Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018), Philippines (Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 2017) and Sri Lanka (Dissanayake 2005). In the Arabian Seas region, there is little species-specific data on&#160;Sharptooth Lemon Shark catch but generally, carcharhinids there are susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types, particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Bonfil 2003, Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (e.g., De Silva 2006, Spaet and Berumen 2015). For example, in the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is caught in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries in northern waters. For example, Harry <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported that it made up 0.3% of the gillnet catch (in numbers) in Queensland. It is&#160; taken in the North Prawn Fishery, with estimates of fishing mortality below those that would lead to population decline (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). It is also captured in small amounts in the North Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery, Northern Territory Barramundi Fishery, and Western Australia Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Fishery (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019). The Sharptooth Lemon Shark was identified as a minor component of the large and prevalent Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU) in northern Australian waters during the early 2000s (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009, Marshall 2011). However, the IUU fishing has declined significantly since 2006 due to increased border surveillance, international agreements, and possibly increased fuel prices and reduction in target shark species (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009, Haward and Bergin 2016).<br/><br/>The reliance of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on mangrove habitats, especially as pupping and nursery grounds makes them susceptible to declines in habitat quality. The extent of mangrove habitat has declined markedly, with 20-35% of areas lost during the last half of the 20th century (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010) as a result of coastal development for urbanisation, aquaculture and agriculture, timber harvesting sand resource extraction (Goldberg <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark was observed in a global baited remote underwater video system (BRUV) survey of global coral reefs (FinPrint 2020). The survey deployed 11,211 video units on 242 reefs in 36 nations throughout the geographic range of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species was not observed in sufficient numbers to quantitatively estimate levels of population reduction, however, it was regularly observed in Australia, and some island nations in the Western Pacific (e.g., French Polynesia, Palau) and Indian (e.g., Seychelles) Oceans (C.A. Simpfendorfer unpubl. data 2020). In these areas, its population appears to have remained stable. However, along the continental margins of Asia and Africa, and some parts of the Pacific this species was rarely observed, suggesting that populations have declined substantially in those areas.&#160;<br/><br/>Market surveys at landing sites in Indonesia (e.g., White 2007, Winter <em>et al</em>. 2020) since the mid-1990s have only recorded this species in small amounts, suggesting that it has undergone substantial decline. A similar situation exists in the Philippines (<span style="""">Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 2017</span>) and Thailand (Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018) where it is only occasionally recorded at landing sites. In other nations (e.g<span style="""">. Bangladesh - A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020; Mynamar - Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015; Malaysia - A. Bin Ali unpubl. data</span> 2020), it is known from historic records, but has not been observed in recent surveys of landing sites.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, the Sharptooth Lemon Shark represented &lt;1% of landings by number in the Red Sea (Yemen, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia) (Bonfil 2003,&#160;Spaet and Berumen 2015). This species was not observed in recent BRUV surveys or underwater visual surveys in this area (Kattan 2014, Spaet <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;Divers in the Red Sea have reported significant declines over the past 30–40 years (J.L.Y. Spaet pers. comm. 06 February 2017). In the Gulf, this species appears to be uncommon with only one historical record reported in Saudi Arabia (Basson <em>et al. </em>1977). More recently, the species was not recorded from landing site surveys in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar (Moore <em>et al. </em>2012, Moore and Peirce 2013). However, the species represented&#160;0.33% of shark landings by number in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and 0.6% of sharks by number traded through the UAE from Oman (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016). Marshall and Barnett (1997) reported this species as being one of the most commonly landed species in Somalia shark fisheries. It is reportedly uncommon in fisheries in Oman, India and the Maldives with no catch data available (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2007,&#160;Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015,&#160;T. Al Mamari, M. Khan, and K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 06 February 2017). In Pakistan, it used to caught in large quantities using live baits, however, there has been an ~90 % decrease in catches in recent years (M. Khan pers. comm. 12 December 2020).&#160;Reports indicate that shark resources in the Red Sea, particularly off Sudan, Djibouti, Yemen (including the Socotra Archipelago), and Somalia were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002, Glaser <em>et al. </em>2015). Shark catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001, despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is regularly caught in small amounts as a non-target species in gillnet fisheries in the north of the country (e.g. Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011). Catch levels have not caused the decline of the species, and it is considered to be sustainably fished (<span style="""">Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019</span>).<br/><br/>The interpretation of the level of global population reduction is complicated by the divergent state of this species between island (limited population reduction) and continental margin (large population reductions) portions of its range. However, it is no longer observed in many parts of its range and this large area across which it has declined, compared to the habitat area available in small island nations and northern Australia where it remains healthy and thus has some refuge from fishing, suggests that the overall level of population reduction is likely to be large. Thus, the Sharptooth Lemon Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50-79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years).",Decreasing,"The Sharptooth Lemon Shark is widespread in coastal waters of the tropical and subtropical Indian and Northwest, Western Central, and Eastern Central Pacific Oceans (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","The meat of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark is used fresh, dried, salted, frozen, or smoked. Fields <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported that Sharptooth Lemon Shark made up 0.6% of fin trimmings sold in Hong Kong. The species is occasionally displayed in aquaria. In the Western and Central Pacific, the species is a key component of the tourism industry where diving and interactions with this shark regularly occur. It is estimated that the species generates around $5.4 million USD per year within a shark feeding ecotourism operation in French Polynesia (Clua <em>et al</em>.2011).",Marine,"There are few species-specific regulations in place to protect this species. In northern Australia, fisheries that target sharks are managed using output (i.e., effort controls) and/or Total Allowable Catches (Queensland) or Individual Transferable Quotas (Northern Territory). These catch limits are not species-specific, but are for sharks or subsets of shark species. There are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species in many range states. Marine Protected Areas are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge for reef associated sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020) and cover significant parts of the range, especially in the Pacific (e.g., French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Palau). To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). The use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) has been shown to be an effective way to reduce the catches of large sharks in prawn and shrimp trawls (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2020). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

For example, samples from the northern and southern Great Barrier Reef showed differentiation. Samples from the Eastern Pacific (Costa Rica) have low genetic diversity (a single mitochondrial haplotype) but are genetically similar to those from the Central Pacific.&#160;<br/><br/>There are numerous reports of declines in reef shark populations throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans (e.g. MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020; Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010), but few specific to Whitetip Reef Sharks.

The analysis estimate depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef level depletion estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Whitetip Reef Sharks was estimated as 48.8% (standard error 39.8–57.7%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (~37 years) (see Supplementary Information). As such it is concluded that the Whitetip Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% in the last 3 generation lengths (~37 years) and is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.",Decreasing,"The Whitetip Reef Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean from western Africa to the Eastern Pacific (Last and Stevens 2009, Whitney <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<em><br/></em>","The meat of this species is sold fresh, frozen, salted and dried for human consumption at local markets throughout it range.

Queensland, Australia has a trip limit of one in place for commercial and recreational fishers. Some countries across its range have banned the targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Palau, French Polynesia, Cook Islands). However, incidental catches frequently occur in artisanal fisheries that are often exempt from these rules. However, there are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species. Marine Protected Areas that incorporate &gt;20 km of coral reef can provide significant protections because of the limited movements observed in this species (Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2020). MPAs are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020).

They are often found over sand and gravel substrates feeding on aquatic insects, mussels, worms and crustaceans. Spawning normally occurs from April through early July with mature shovelnose migrating upriver to spawn over rocky substrates in flowing water between 19–21ºC. Individuals mature after 5–7 years of age, at total lengths of approximately 500 mm and 630 mm for males and females, respectively. Their weight at this age ranges from 0.9–1.3 kg (National Paddlefish and Sturgeon Steering Committee 1992). <br/> <br/>River sturgeon are uniquely adapted to mainstem river systems which are characterized by their large scale, diverse habitats, and a dynamic nature (Beamesderfer and Farr 1997). Adaptations include mobility, opportunistic feeding habits, delayed maturation, longevity, and high individual fecundity. Unfortunately, in recent decades these same life history characteristics have become a handicap to the species and led to population declines because of man-induced habitat fragmentation and destruction (Beamesderfer and Farr 1997).","Alteration of large rivers and construction of locks and dams for navigation purposes has contributed significantly to the decline of shovelnose sturgeon by blocking access to ancestral spawning grounds and by eliminating its requisite lotic habitat.

This may be due to its relatively small size in comparison to lake sturgeon (<em>Acipenser fulvescens</em>) and the pallid sturgeon (<em>Scaphirhynchus albus</em>), the other two sturgeon species found historically throughout its range. Shovelnose are locally abundant in some areas where large river habitat is still fairly intact and modest commercial fisheries occur in a few states where some acceptable riverine habitat still exists (National Paddlefish and Sturgeon Steering Committee 1992). <br/> <br/>Hesse and Carreiro (1997) recorded causes for shovelnose sturgeon decline (as reported to them by state biologists) as habitat degradation, loss of natural hydrograph, sedimentation, channelization, loss of spawning habitat, flood control and navigation dams, artificial water management, water temperature alteration, and past over-harvest. Boreman (1997) noted that sturgeon life history and habitat use attributes make the species highly vulnerable to fishing pressure. Specifically, he attributed this vulnerability to their older age (than most fishes) at full maturity, lower fecundity values, and older age at which 50% of the lifetime egg production is realized with no fishing mortality. <br/> <br/>Shovelnose sturgeon continue to be commercially harvested in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Arkansas closed shovelnose sturgeon to commercial fishing on its state waters of the Mississippi River in 2000, as a measure to reduce the by-catch of endangered pallid sturgeon. Keenlyne (1997) reported the commercial harvest of shovelnose meat and roe in 1992 as follows: <br/> <br/>Arkansas: 14,500 kg meat; 88–110 kg caviar <br/>Illinois: 22,335 kg meat; 77 kg caviar <br/>Indiana: no data on meat harvest; 55 kg caviar <br/>Iowa: 34,603 kg meat; 55 kg caviar <br/>Kentucky: no data on meat harvest; 88 kg caviar <br/>Missouri: 26,460 kg meat; 66–88 kg caviar <br/>Wisconsin: 11,025 kg meat; 33 kg caviar","In 2001, all of the states within the current and historic range of the shovelnose sturgeon were surveyed by the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association (MICRA) to determine the shovelnose sturgeon status. Ten of the range states responded with sufficient information to allow the author to place the individual states into one of four classifications: (1) extirpated, (2) rare/vulnerable/imperiled, (3) stable and (4) undetermined. The remaining range states were assigned these classifications based on information provided by the Nature Conservancy at their website: <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer"">http://www.natureserve.org/explore</a>. The species has been extirpated from five states, is rare to imperiled in four states, stable in 10 states and has undetermined status in five states.
<br/>
<br/>Historically, shovelnose were apparently common in the Tennessee River system, all the way to the French Broad River on the Tennessee-North Carolina border before the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reservoir system was constructed (Etnier and Starnes 1993). These authors note that, while the species may still occur there sporadically, no recent records exist for either the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers. Sprague (1960) documented the decline in catch and condition of the shovelnose over a five-year period in the Missouri River after impoundment of Lewis and Clark Lake. However, since then these subpopulations have apparently recovered and stabilized (Hesse and Carreiro 1997). Trautman (1981) stated that the shovelnose was considered abundant in the Ohio River until 1911 when the river began ""ponding"" as a result of construction of the slackwater navigation project, thereby partially stopping the spawning run. After that, Trautman (1981) said fishermen reported a drastic decrease in shovelnose sturgeon abundance.  Mettee, <em>et al</em>. (1996) considered the shovelnose extirpated in Alabama.
<br/>
<br/>Today, the shovelnose sturgeon still occurs in most of the large tributaries of the Upper Mississippi River from Wisconsin to Illinois. Hesse and Carreiro (1997) listed 59 rivers, creeks, oxbows and bayous in the Mississippi River Basin where shovelnose sturgeon occurred historically, but only 44 of these were listed as supporting the species today. In Illinois, the species is most abundant in the Wabash River, a tributary to the Ohio River (Smith 1979). According to Smith (1979) the Wabash is less impacted by flood-control dams and other modifications than are the remainder of Illinois’ large rivers.
<br/>
<br/>In the mainstem Mississippi River, numbers of shovelnose sturgeon have decreased sharply since 1900 (Becker 1983), although the species is still commonly taken by commercial fishermen (UMRCC Annual Reports; Etnier and Starnes 1993. Several authors have noted a lack of natural reproduction in areas of the Missouri and have attributed it to man-made alterations to shovelnose sturgeon habitat (Bailey and Cross 1954, June 1977, Moos 1978).   Meanwhile, upstream from the Missouri River mainstem impoundments shovelnose sturgeon remain abundant in the river below Great Falls, Montana and in the major tributaries (Montana DNRC 1977). Robison and Buchanan (1988) describe the shovelnose as especially abundant in the unimpounded portions of the Arkansas, lower White and Red rivers in Arkansas. According to Hesse and Carreiro (1997) state biologists attribute the success of White River sturgeon to a somewhat natural hydrograph with seasonal floods, good gravel bars, and backwater complexes.
<br/>
<br/>Hesse and Carreiro (1997) concluded that while shovelnose sturgeon have probably been considered less at risk than other sturgeon species, evidence suggests that deterioration of the shovelnose’s overall range is keeping pace with that of the other sturgeon species.
<br/>
<br/>Obrecht (1996) noted that shovelnose have been reintroduced into the Bighorn River Basin in Wyoming, where they had been extirpated by dams which blocked spawning migrations from downstream in Montana. West Virginia and New Mexico have also developed reintroduction plans for rivers where the shovelnose has been extirpated (Keenlyne 1997). The Ohio Division of Wildlife reports a plan to reintroduce the shovelnose sturgeon in the Ohio River above Meldahl Lock and Dam at Ohio River kilometer 702 (Scott Schell, pers. comm.).

Shovelnose sturgeon are rare above Newburg, Indiana (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 1990), but relatively abundant below Smithland Locks and Dam at Ohio River kilometer 1,479 (Greg Conover, USFWs, pers. comm.). The <em>Scaphirhynchus</em> species, previously reported as shovelnose sturgeon in the drainages of Mobile Bay in Alabama by Smith-Vaniz (1968), were reclassified by Williams and Clemmer (1991) as the Alabama sturgeon (<em>Scaphirhynchus suttkusi</em>). The only known subpopulation of shovelnose sturgeon in the Alabama portion of the Tennessee River is apparently extinct. Shovelnose sturgeon may still occur sporadically in the lower Tennessee or Cumberland Rivers (Etnier and Starnes 1993).

It is an anadromous species which undergoes seasonal annual migrations to freshwater to spawn. It does not appear to be overly common, and is considered rare in parts of its range.&#160;<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is a highly-valued food fish, and has been the subject of artificial breeding efforts in China and South Korea for the purposes of stock enhancement and in order to supply fish for human consumption. This species' dependence on freshwater systems to spawn and its predictable, seasonal mass spawning migrations into freshwater systems render it particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Habitat modification in estuaries is occurring in parts of its range and we infer that these events are contributing to population declines in parts of its range. Some authors have noted population declines in this species, which are currently unquantifiable. This high-value species occupies a shallow depth range (&lt;20 m) and undergoes mass-spawning migrations to freshwater systems, factors which render it particularly vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal areas as well as to overfishing.&#160;It is inferred that this species is dependent on fisheries management, such as off-fishing seasons, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, protected areas, and the increasing reliance on species-specific aquaculture to meet increasing consumer demand which can not be met by wild stocks alone.&#160;<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is conservation dependent and is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. Due to the economic importance of the <em>Takifugu</em> genus, and the prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological methods in addition to habitat and population monitoring.","<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is anadromous, migrating into freshwater rivers for reproduction during the spawning season. The newly hatched larvae remain in freshwater for several months before migrating back to the sea.

They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver.

Highly-effective fishing gear, including modified longlines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. ocellatus</span> are unknown it has been suggested that populations are declining due in part to over-fishing. It is likely that spawning aggregations of this species, which are found in freshwater, are intrinsically vulnerable to over-exploitation.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations<br/></span> Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia.

Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and overfishing</span><br/> Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/> This species is anadromous and breeds in freshwater. Several of its known breeding and feeding grounds, including the estuaries of the lower Yangtze river and several downstream lakes have recorded declines in fish biodiversity and shifts in species composition which have been attributed to anthropogenic habitat alteration, river modification (i.e. dam construction), overfishing, heavy metal pollution, deforestation and land erosion (Fu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Zhang<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008, Huang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Chen and Zhu 2008).

Additionally,<em> T. ocellatus&#160;</em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p>      <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> can be found in both&#160; freshwater and marine  protected areas.

This corresponds  with the spawning migration of this species in China, although whether  or not this species spawns in the lake is unknown.

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 60 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Whitespotted Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and their skins are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that the Whitespotted Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","The Whitespotted Whipray&#160;occurs inshore on soft substrates<em></em> down to depths of at least 60 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 116 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 48–58 cm DW, and females mature at 63 cm DW, and size-at-birth is 13–21 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 2–4 pups (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). There is no information on this species' maximum age and age-at-maturity, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for&#160;Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Jacobsen and Bennett 2011). Female Blackspotted Whipray have a maximum age of 29 years and an  age-at-maturity of nine years and thus, a generation length of 19 years  (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). The Blackspotted Whipray has a smaller maximum size (80 cm DW) than the Whitespotted Whipray (116 cm DW), therefore generation length was scaled to be 25 years.","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Whitespotted Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990–2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant 2019). However, since the 1970s, most of the Taiwan global shark catch is from Taiwan fishing vessels operating in distant waters outside Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956–2004) but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956–2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics <span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Seine nets and bottom trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries catch respectively, followed by longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).</span></p><p>The Whitespotted Whipray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet, lift net, longline, push net, and traps and it is retained for human consumption or fish meal production (FAO 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).</p><p>In the Philippines, the Whitespotted Whipray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, hook and line, gillnet, set net, and traps. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3 Gross Tonnage (GT) vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in the Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, the effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). S<span class=""tlid-translation"">tingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2008).</span></p><p>The Whitespotted Whipray is the most commonly landed ray in the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters (D’Alberto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). These fisheries, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive trawl and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly et al. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nm from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of its fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 Kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 Kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased by nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as bottom set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the SW region of the country will go out to sea for more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 tons per year with 170,000 tons (per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 tons from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg / hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass-reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20-25 days (NARA 2003).</p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. Approximately 24,554 trawl vessels are operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over one generation length). About 6,600 trawlers are operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, over 13,400 gill netters are operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). A ray fishery has recently begun (2 years) in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and uses bottom set gillnets to catch up to 6 tonnes of rays per trip (3-5 days). There are currently 20–<span class=""tlid-translation"">40 boats operating in this fishery (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen going from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2006).&#160;</span></span></p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). <span lang=""EN-US"">In Taiwan, indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). There has been an estimated 10–20% loss of intertidal habitats in Taiwan since the 1970s (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).</span></p>","<p>There are no population species-specific trend data for this species.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403143"">D</a><span lang=""EN-US"">espite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to <span lang=""EN-US"">2014 have been reconstructed for the&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Chinese EEZ</a>, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. </span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). As the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improve, fishing effort and power are continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The reconstructed catch data showed a decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Chinese EEZ over 65 years, from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014, a 67% decline in less than three generation lengths. Additionally, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured in Chinese waters (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Taiwan, landings data<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;are available on the combined catch of all ray species taken by bottom trawl in Da-xi, Yilan County. The landings increased by 98% over 14 years from 1993–2006 (Lee 2008). That is, from ~1 t in 1993 to ~50 t in 2006. There is no detailed concurrent effort data, however the number of trawl vessels operating in the Yilan County area during the latter part of the time-series (1999–2008) were relatively stable (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics 2019). This marked increase in rays caught by trawlers in the Yilan County from 1993–2006 is likely a reflection of an increase in reporting of the ray catch over that period, rather than an actual increase in abundance (H. Hans and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019)<strong><span lang=""EN-US"">.</span></strong></span></p><p>In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017) This indicates a decrease of 76% in 16 years (less than one generation length) from 1991–2006.</p><p>Landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t despite the constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite the increased effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three-generation lengths (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5%.</p><p>Four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Eastern Indonesia, Central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’). Finally, research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>The catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased by 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia, there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Whitespotted Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years).</p><p>In Cambodia, this species is now considered rare but is caught in trawls, gillnets, and longlines (S. Li unpubl. data 2020). This may be indicative of historic depletions.</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998–2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 tonnes since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inferences on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of IUU fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general, fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species.</p><p>Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort. In Viet Nam, there is a lack of species-specific data, however, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–<span lang=""EN-US"">2014 have been reconstructed for the Viet Nam EEZ, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Viet Nam EEZ over 29 years from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in <span lang=""EN-US"">sharks, rays, and skates<span lang=""EN-US""> landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the <span lang=""EN-US"">fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).</span></span></p><p>In Bangladesh, <span lang=""EN-US"">questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. These declines have led to fishers using other net types (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because “it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion” resulting in many attempts to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005).</p><p>This species is very&#160;rarely seen in the Gulf of Oman and has not been documented in landing surveys from Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE (Moore <em>et al. </em>2012, Moore and Peirce 2013, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). However, it was recently caught in research trawls surveys off the Gulf coast of the UAE (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). In Iranian waters, the species has shown sharp declines in trawl catches since 2010, but these have not been quantified (F. Owfi pers. comm. 07/02/2017). In Oman, this was one of the most commonly captured batoid species in research trawls in 2007-2008 (McCoy <em>et al.</em> 2009) but was not common in landing surveys (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p><p>In Pakistan, the species is caught in gillnet and trawl fisheries and has recently shown signs of declines of at least 30% (M. Khan pers. comm. 07/02/2017).&#160;Although this species appears in landings in both Pakistan and India, the population is suspected to have declined due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing.&#160;The annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990<span lang=""EN-US"">–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, in 1990 the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr to 0.24 in 2004 (Raje &amp; Zacharia 2009). The Whitespotted Whipray averaged 1.22% of trawl captured in weight but trends in landings across years were not available. These declines are likely representative of the broader situation across the species' range, where fishing pressure is intense (see Threats section), for example, between 2003<span lang=""EN-US"">–2004, 120 t of Whitespotted Whiprays were landed from trawl fisheries in northwestern India (Raje&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Trawl fisheries have expanded rapidly since then (K.V.

Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). They are frequently landed throughout the Southeast Asian portion of their range and the meat is consumed fresh for human consumption.&#160;</p><p>Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and restaurants (Haque A.B unpubl. data 2020).</p>In the Arabian/Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption.&#160;In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia (M. Khan&#160;unpubl. data 2017). In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin where the meat of the Whitespotted Whipray is preferred (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2017). The skin of whiprays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). Ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price in India.",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>Throughout Indonesia, there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia, there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983, in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). These bans and closures imply that ‘baby trawlers’ became illegal (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on ""muro ami"" gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer <em>et al.</em> 2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p><a name=""_Hlk21689683""><span lang=""EN-US"">In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). </span></a><a name=""_Hlk21689697""></a><span lang=""EN-US"">There is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019).

Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T.

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 40 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and Bleeker's Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and the skins are desirable and are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). Overfishing of inshore habitats is evident throughout its range such that it is now considered rare in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Its habitat has also been degraded by urban development and agriculture. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that Bleeker's Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","<p>Bleeker's Whipray is benthic from the surface to depths of 40 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 119 cm disc width (DW), males and females mature at ~51 cm DW and size-at-birth is ~21 cm DW (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic vivipartity with litter sizes of 1 or 2 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Little else is known of its biology. Generation length was based on data for Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011). Female Blackspotted Whipray have a maximum age of 29 years and an  age-at-maturity of nine years and thus, a generation length of 19 years  (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). The maximum size of the Bleeker's Whipray  is&#160; larger (119 cm DW) than that of the Blackspotted  Whipray (80 cm DW), thus it is suspected the generation length of Bleeker's  Whipray is 25 years.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, Bleeker's Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries.&#160;In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 Kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 Kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters, before a nationwide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as bottom set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the SW region of the country will go out to sea for more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In India, juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. Approximately 24,554 trawl vessels are operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over one generation length).&#160; About 6,600 trawlers were operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, over 13,400 gill netters are operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen going from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2006).&#160;</span></p><p>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 tons per year with 170,000 tons (per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 tons from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg / hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fibreglass-reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20-25 days (NARA 2003).</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).&#160;</p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak.&#160;</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite the constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths, this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5% (75 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;&#160;</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places them in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species.</p><p>Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. dat<a>a</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al. </em>2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because “it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion” resulting in many attempts were made to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005).</p><p>Although this species appears to be common in Pakistan and India, the population is suspected to have declined due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period, trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Bleeker's Whipray was the most dominant species landed during this period with an average annual landing of 250 t, at a catch rate 0.18 kg h<sup>-1&#160;</sup>constituting 51.1% of the ray landings. However, the catch decreased from 371.0 t in 1993-95 to 148.0 t in 2002–04 (Raje and Zacharia 2009; as&#160;<em>Himantura alcockii</em>). This would be a ~95%&#160;decline if extrapolated over a period of three generation spans (75 years) of Bleeker's Whipray.&#160;These declines are likely representative of the broader situation across large parts of the species' range, where fishing pressure is intense (see Threats section), for example, between 2003–2004, 1,391 t of Bleeker's Whiprays were landed from trawl fisheries in northwestern India (Raje&#160;<em style=""font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"">et al.</em>&#160;2007). Ongoing fishing is suspected to result in continuing population declines in the future.&#160;</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Bleeker's Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Bleeker's Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (75 years).</p>",Decreasing,"Bleeker's Whipray occurs in the Western and Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from Pakistan to Malaysia (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Krajangdara 2019, A.

This species is sometimes landed in the markets in Singapore, where catch from Indonesia and Malaysia is landed&#160;(N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). They are infrequently landed in Bangladesh, though desirable due to their size, and the skin is exported to Myanmar (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The meat is consumed both locally and exported.&#160;Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and restaurants (A.B.

Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).</p><p>There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020).</p><p>Pakistan and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, Sri Lanka does not have trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored throughout this species’ range.</p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 75 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Whitespotted Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and their skins are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). In Thailand, ray landings have decreased by 78% in 8 years, a significant decrease in less than one generation length. Overfishing of inshore habitats is evident throughout its range such that it is now considered rare in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Its habitat has also been degraded by urban development and agriculture. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that the Whitenose Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","<p>The Whitenose Whipray is demersal on soft habitats from the surface to 75 m (Weigmann<em>&#160;</em>2016). It reaches a maximum size of 119 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 50 cm DW and size-at-birth is 18 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy (White <em>et al. </em>2006). Little else is known of its biology. Generation length was based on data for Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011). Female Blackspotted Whipray have a maximum age of 29 years and an  age-at-maturity of nine years and thus, a generation length of 19 years  (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). The maximum size of the Whitenose Whipray  is&#160; larger (119 cm DW) than that of the Blackspotted  Whipray (80 cm DW), thus it is suspected the generation length of Whitenose Whipray  is 25 years.</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Whitenose Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence  fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet,  lift net, longline, push net, and traps and it is retained for human  consumption or fish meal production (FAO 2020). The Whitenose Whipray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).</p><p>In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, the effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). S<span class=""tlid-translation"">tingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2008).<span class=""tlid-translation""></span></p><p>The Whitenose Whipray is one of the most commonly landed rays in the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters (D’Alberto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). These fisheries, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive trawl and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nm from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 Kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 Kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nation wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. This species is the third most commonly landed species in Myanmar (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as bottom set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the SW region of the country will go out to sea for more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Ureported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).</p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species. Reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates are available for the Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), based on landings data from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Viet Nam EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p>Landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian EEZs. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian EEZ.<p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. When scaled to three generation lengths (75 years), this decrease is equivalent to 93%. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016), or a decrease of ~92% when scaled to three generation lengths (75 years). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 92–97.5%.</p><p>Four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Eastern Indonesia, Central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’). Finally, research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, the catch has since decreased by 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 tper year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber <em>et al. </em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia, there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Whitenose Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019) and 100% when scaled to three generation lengths (75 years).&#160;</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of IUU fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places them in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species. Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Whitenose Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Whitenose Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (75 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Whitenose Whipray is found in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from Bangladesh to Java, Indonesia and to Viet Nam (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).","<p>The Whitenose Whipray is used for its meat and skin (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). The meat is consumed fresh or salted and dried. This species is also landed and sold in the markets in Singapore, which are landed from Indonesia and Malaysian waters&#160;(N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and restaurants (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance are limited (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020).</p><p>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.</p><p>In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020).</p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</span></span></p><p>Available data for glass, yellow and silver eels (see ‘Population’ section) indicate that this species has declined in abundance across its range by at least 50% over the last 24 years (<em>ca</em>. three generations). As such, <em>A. japonica</em> has been assessed as Endangered (EN) under A2bcd. In brackish water areas of Japan, where naturally-recruited wild eels are dominant, declining trends have been observed in yellow and silver eel CPUE data (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em><em>, </em>Kaifu and Yokouchi<em> </em>2019). Regression analysis showed that silver eel catches in Okayama prefecture, Japan decreased 99.0% in 13 years (2002–2015), and long-line and set-net CPUEs of naturally-recruited wild yellow eel in the same prefecture also decreased 79.6% and 79.5%, respectively, in 13 years (2003–2016) (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>). For glass eels, catch data are potentially biased due to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) exploitation (Kaifu 2019). Thus, landings data of glass eels cannot be accepted as a precise measure of population status (Kaifu 2019). However, due to the large scale of landings data, it can to some extent reflect true changes in fishing yields and is still helpful to understand stock status. Glass eel data gathered from nine prefectures in Japan indicated CPUE has declined by 47.2% over three generations. </p><p><a name=""_Hlk7697020"">Determining changes in abundance is particularly challenging due to a considerable lack of fisheries-independent monitoring data for eels in East Asia. For this assessment, fisheries standardised catch per unit effort (CPUE) was predominantly used and catch data from countries/regions across the distribution of <em>A. japonica </em>were also considered.<em> </em>The quality and quantity of data is disproportionate across the species’ range with the most extensive data sets coming from Japan. It is generally agreed that more fisheries-independent monitoring of eel populations is required throughout the range of the Japanese Eel. However, until such data become available, a precautionary assessment of trends in the fisheries time series data is necessary to highlight potential threats and apparent trends, as a guide for future research and conservation. Furthermore, as with some other anguillid species, the available data relating to <em>A. japonica</em> is predominantly from freshwater, where stocking can occur. In Japan, Japanese Eels are fished in both inland and coastal waters (Hakoyama <em>et al</em>. 2016), therefore coastal areas in Japan offer opportunities to investigate the population dynamics of naturally-recruited wild eels (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>).</a> There is currently one stock assessment study of <em>A. japonica</em> (Tanaka <em>et al</em>. 2014), although within this, the effects of stocking in inland fisheries were not considered. Data on eel biological characteristics (survival rate, growth rate and sex ratio), essential for assessment of population dynamics, differ significantly between wild and cultured-and-stocked eels. </p><p>Across East Asia, <em>A. japonica</em> is an important fishery resource with a long tradition of use and has high economic and cultural value. As such, one proposed driver of declines is unsustainable exploitation for consumption and stocking culture facilities. Another factor that has been proposed as causing declines in the Japanese Eel is short term changes in oceanic conditions (e.g., El Niño, typhoons, mid-scale eddies, bifurcation, global warming) which influence larval survival or transport (Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2012). These in turn are potentially exacerbated by multiple and more localised threats that include barriers to upstream and downstream migration (e.g. Tatsukawa 2003, Kume <em>et al</em>. 2019, Kume <em>et al</em>. 2020, Shuai <em>et al</em>. 2020), loss of habitat (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2014), pollution caused by industrial and agricultural runoff (Arai 2014), and modifications to coastal, riverine and other habitats (Yoshimura <em>et al</em>. 2005, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>a</em>). Our understanding of the individual and cumulative impacts of all these threats is poor and mitigating them in isolation is unlikely to have a significant effect on the species’ status. </p><p>There has been progress towards implementing conservation and management interventions within the species range. The capture of silver eel was prohibited or restricted in ten prefectures&#160;in Japan, with the intention of preserving spawning eels in these areas.&#160;Co-operation between Japan, China and Taiwan, Province of China in relation to improving the status of the Japanese Eel started in 2012, aimed at establishing strengthened fisheries management as well as introducing traceability schemes. In September 2014, a ‘Joint Statement’ was adopted by mainland China, Taiwan, Province of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, for the conservation and management of the Japanese Eel, through a restriction on the amount of wild-caught glass eels that can be used in aquaculture production (Anonymous&#160;2014).&#160;</p><p>          </p><p>Assessment of the species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> of November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as a leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p>The species is catadromous, spending its lifetime in freshwater, estuaries and coastal environments, including rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, but it migrates thousands of kilometres to spawn. While anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and movements. The proportion of yellow eels that remain in saline waters, rarely, if ever, entering fresh water, is particularly poorly understood which makes management challenging. </p><p>Little is known about the marine component of anguillid life histories in general, but <em>Anguilla japonica</em> stands alone in having a relatively well-studied spawning ecology (Kimura and Tsukamoto 2006, Tsukamoto 2009, Chow <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kurogi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Japanese Eel’s spawning area has been identified as the region along the western side of the seamount chain of the Mariana Ridge (Tsukamoto 1992, 2006, 2009, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2003). Recent studies, based on data from pop-up archival tags, indicate that <em>A. japonica</em> exhibits diel vertical migrations as it swims to the spawning site that occurs in response to light intensity and water temperature (Manabe <em>et al.</em> 2011, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018, Higuchi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The speed of migration was found to be between 18.4–40.6 km/d (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018). The average migration speed in this study was faster than in previous studies – between 2.2 and 15.1 km/d was estimated by Manabe <em>et al</em>. (2011) – possibly due to environmental factors affecting the route (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Eggs and spawning adults have been discovered in the west of Mariana Ridge (Chow <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kurogi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The depths where adults and newly hatched larvae were captured indicate that spawning occurs from 150–200 m (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). </p><p>Leptocephali develop in the pelagic ocean environment and over the course of five to six months they drift towards their estuarine recruitment areas in oceanic currents (Kuroki <em>et al.</em> 2009, Shinoda <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fukuda <em>et al.</em> (2018) collected metamorphosing leptocephali from the mesoscale eddy region to the East of Taiwan and found the onset of metamorphosis into glass eels occurs when leptocephali reach 67.8 ± 2.7 mm, at an age of 137 ± 15 days. This study also highlighted that <em>A. japonica</em> may recruit through the mesoscale eddies in addition to direct transfer from the North Equatorial Current to the Kuroshio. Models using virtual larvae have also suggested an importance of mesoscale eddies in <em>A. japonica</em> larval migration (Chang <em>et al</em>. 2017). Pigmentation stages of <em>A. japonica</em> glass eels are described by Fukuda <em>et al.</em> (2013). Age upon arrival to estuaries is estimated between 154 and 182 days while age at metamorphosis from larvae to glass eels is between 115–137 days (Cheng and Tzeng 1996). Therefore, time from metamorphosis to estuarine arrival is thought to be between 32 and 45 days (Cheng and Tzeng 1996). A full description of the timing of glass eel recruitment to different geographic regions is given in the ‘Geographic Range’ section. Glass eels utilise flood tidal streams selectively at night to migrate inshore in coastal areas (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2016). The subsequent timing of upstream migration of glass eels depends on the water temperature, tidal current and moon phase (Tzeng 1985). </p><p>After reaching coastal waters, a proportion of the population then moves upstream to feed and grow. However, some <em>A. japonica,</em>&#160;referred to as marine residents or ‘sea eels’, never enter freshwater, and remain in estuaries or nearby marine habitats (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 1998). Analysis of the strontium:calcium ratios within the otoliths of maturing eels reveals a signature of the transition between these environments and it has been estimated that substantial proportions (56–86%) of the eels in some areas might be estuarine/marine residents (Tsukamoto and Arai 2001, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2002, Arai <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2008, Kotake <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mochioka <em>et al</em>. 2012, Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2012). This suggests that there is flexibility in the continental migration of <em>A. japonica</em>, and an ability to adapt to various habitats and salinities. When newly recruiting juveniles grow to yellow eel stage in saline waters, they are likely to become estuarine/marine residents due to a developmental shift in salinity preference (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2019). </p><p>During their growth phase, <em>A. japonica</em> feed mostly on invertebrates such as benthic crustaceans and insect larvae, and also on small fishes (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Itakura <em>et al.</em> (2015b) found differences in feeding habits of eels in rivers with natural shore areas when compared to revetment areas. Overall, in natural shore areas there was a greater prey diversity consumed. Terrestrial oligochaetes were observed only in the diet of eels from areas with natural shores, whereas bivalves were consumed more in areas where there was revetment. The maximum size this species attains is approximately 100 cm TL and 1.5 kg in weight (Kotake <em>et al</em>. 2007). In a survey of yellow stage <em>A. japonica</em> in nine prefectures in Japan, growth rate (mm/year) was 96.7 ± 38.6 for females (n = 3643), and 120.5 ± 65.4 for males (n = 907) (Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2014). </p><p>Yellow stage <em>A. japonica</em> have been found to exhibit dormancy in freshwater during winter, with little activity occurring at temperatures below 13°C (Itakura <em>et al.</em> 2017). Eels tracked over the period of a year displayed small ranges and a homing ability that allowed them to return to their original habitat from as far as 1 km away (Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2017). Onset of spawning migration in silver eels has been linked to lunar periodicity, and silver eel activity has been found to be highest during the new moon period (Sudo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Experimental results indicate that silver <em>A. japonica</em> may use geomagnetic cues for orientation back to their natal water for spawning (Nishi <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>As with many eel species, the generation times for <em>A. japonica</em> are highly variable depending on sex, individual variation and locality/latitude. For example, Kotake <em>et al</em>. (2007) studied <em>A. japonica</em> from three different latitudes and found that the age of silver males ranged from 4 to 10 years and silver females from 3 to 17 years. Other studies on the average age of silver-phase Japanese Eels, provide estimates of 6.9 and&#160;7.8 years (Kotake <em>et al</em>. 2005), 8.3 and 9.9 years (Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2009), and 4.4 and 5.5 years (Xie <em>et al</em>. 2010) for male and female eels, respectively. <a name=""_Hlk16766248"">The mean age of female and male silver eels was estimated at 7.7 and 6.6 years, respectively, based on Kotake <em>et al</em>. (2005), Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. (2009) and Xie <em>et al</em>. (2010), considering sample size of each study. The total average for both male and female silver eels from these studies, considering sample size, was 7.4 years. This gives an estimated generation length of 8.4 years, inclusive of one year for migration – for the purpose of consistency with other assessments, this was rounded to eight years.</a></p><p>                </p><p>Note: <em>Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em></p><p></p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk531096975""><em>Anguilla </em></a><em>japonica</em>,<em> </em>as with all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby<em> et al.</em> 2015). It is therefore important to highlight, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of pressures, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to threats in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>Unsustainable fishing of <em>A. japonica</em> glass eels to stock farming facilities on a national/international scale may constitute a major threat to the population. Farms meet over 90% of global demand for eel products and all seed for farms come from the wild stock (Shiraishi and Crook 2015). Declines in <em>A. japonica </em>have driven culture facilities to source glass eels of other species from elsewhere in Asia (e.g. <em>A. bicolor</em> and <em>A. marmorata</em>), Europe (<em>A. anguilla</em>) and the Americas (<em>A. rostrata</em>) (Han <em>et al</em>. 2002, Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, the threat from unsustainable fishing persists, as <em>A. japonica</em> remains the preferred species in East Asia, and the species of choice for consumption in Japan (Shiraishi and Crook 2015). High demand for <em>A. japonica</em> glass eels has resulted in dramatic increases in price in recent years (Fisheries Agency of Japan 2019<em>a</em>). In addition, ongoing illegal fishing and trade, mainly in glass eels, makes it difficult to evaluate the true impact of exploitation on the species (Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>Restocking occurs in Japan (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2010), and recent research is beginning to highlight the scale of stocking in certain localities, through quantifying the proportion of stocked eels in inland waters (Ministry of Environment 2016, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>, Kaifu 2019). During the 1960s, dispersal of <em>A. anguilla</em> imported to Japan for farming occurred, either through escape from culture ponds, or by mixing with <em>A. japonica</em> released for stocking. A genetic study by Arai <em>et al</em>. (2017) found <em>A. anguilla</em> was dominant in the uppermost sample site of the Tone river system. Interspecific competition of this species with <em>A. japonica</em> may pose a threat, due to similarities in functional morphology and similar niche preference. This threat will diminish as the number of European Eels in Japanese waters has substantially decreased over time (Okamura <em>et al</em>. 2008) and the species is very unlikely to successfully escape and spawn outside of its natural range. The exotic <em>A. rostrata</em> has also been found in Taiwan, after being imported at the glass eel stage for farming, and subsequently escaping from aquaculture ponds (Han <em>et al</em>. 2002, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2009). This could present a risk of interspecific hybridisation, although successful spawning is unlikely due to species specific migration routes (Han <em>et al</em>. 2002, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>Environmental fluctuations, such as changes in ocean circulation, and El Niño, have been proposed to influence larval transport and survival, and as a consequence, the recruitment of glass eels to coastal and freshwater habitats (Kimura <em>et al</em>. 2001, Bonhommeau <em>et al</em>. 2008, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2012, Chang <em>et al</em>. 2016, Lin <em>et al</em>. 2017a, Chang <em>et al.</em> 2018, Hsiung <em>et al</em>. 2018, Hsiung and Kimura 2019). However, <span class=""apple-converted-space"">there remains considerable uncertainty, surrounding the role of changing oceanographic conditions on all anguillid eel population dynamics and further research is required in order to understand the influence of both natural climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic effects. <span class=""apple-converted-space""></span></p><p><em>Anguilla japonica</em>&#160;is the native host of the nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>) that parasitises the swim bladder and has been proposed to affect survivorship and migration behaviour of non-native species. Japanese Eels, however, appear to show more evidence of acquired immunity&#160;and significantly reduced pathological effects&#160;than the European Eel (Knopf 2006) possibly because of longer historical exposure to this parasite (Münderle <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p><p>As with other anguillid eels, the upstream and downstream migration of the Japanese Eel has been impacted due to the presence of barriers in waterways. In Japan, construction of dams has reduced eel catches in some areas (Tatsukawa 2003).&#160;On 135 sampling sites in five rivers in Japan, individual density of Japanese Eel was negatively correlated with cumulative height of dams and weirs located in the lower reach of each sampling site (Ministry of the Environment 2016). Other studies investigated young yellow eels in a small river and reported density is negatively correlated with the number of weirs (Kume <em>et al</em>. 2019, 2020). Shuai <em>et al</em>. (2020) reported that dams could have blocked eel’s migration routes and affected their spatial dispersal.</p><p>Other threats include the loss of river habitat due to agricultural, urban and industrial development. Chen <em>et al</em>. (2014) used Landsat imagery to determine the amount of Japanese Eel habitat loss caused by human activity in 16 rivers across East-Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China). The study revealed a reduction in effective habitat area of 76.8% from the 1970s to 2010s, with the highest reductions in China (81.5%) and Taiwan (49.3%). In Japan, part of the reduction in river habitat has included the extensive revetment of the shorelines of rivers and lakes for flood control purposes (Yoshimura <em>et al</em>. 2005, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>a</em>). In a study comparing areas of natural shoreline to those with revetment, there was found to be lower abundance, poorer body condition, emptier stomachs, and reduced prey diversity within stomach contents, in eels sampled in areas of revetment (Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>b</em>).&#160; </p><p>Development has also increased industrial effluent, and agricultural and urban runoff, all of which are known to negatively impact eel numbers through displacement, reduced reproductive success and direct mortality, particularly during the spawning migration (Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2006, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). One example is organochlorines, primarily used in pesticides, which have shown to be persistent in aquatic environments even after their ban (Arai 2014). These chemicals are lipid soluble, and therefore accumulation was greater in silver stage <em>A. japonica</em> and eels that had resided for longer in freshwater (Arai 2014). In Lake Shinji, high concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticide effluent from rice paddies has been indirectly linked to the decline in average fishing yields of eel between 1981–1992 and 1993–2004, after its introduction in 1993 (Yamamuro <em>et al</em>. 2019). This may have been caused by a reduction in aquatic invertebrates, a prey source for <em>A. japonica</em> (Yamamuro <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160; </p><p>Predation of <em>A. japonica</em> naturally occurs in both continental and oceanic life stages. Miyake <em>et al.</em> (2018) studied the influence of predation on glass eel recruitment in the Tone River Estuary, through genetic identification of stomach contents. Glass eels were found in the stomachs of the channel catfish (<em>Ictalurus punctatus</em>) – an invasive species in the river system – and blackfin sea bass (<em>Lateolabrax latus</em>)<em> </em>confirming these species are predators of <em>A. japonica</em>. The level of influence of these predators on <em>A. japonica</em> is unknown, although blackfin sea bass occurs commonly in areas where glass eels recruit, and channel catfish may be a new predator, in rivers where its distribution has expanded.</p><p>                  </p><p>Disease may constitute another threat for <em>A. japonica</em>. Japanese Eel endothelial cells-infecting virus (JEECV) causes viral endothelial cell necrosis (VECNE), which has an experimental mortality of ~60% (Okazaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). Since the 1980s, this has caused economic loss within eel farms (Okazaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). Infection of wild caught <em>A. japonica</em> at both yellow eel (Okazaki <em>et al</em>. 2015) and elver (Okazaki <em>et al</em>. 2016) development stages has now been reported.</p><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p></p><p>Most population genetic studies have previously indicated that&#160;<em>Anguilla japonica</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;consists of one genetically homogenous, panmictic population (Ishikawa <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2001, <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Han <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Minegishi <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012, Gong <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2014). Recent research (Igarashi <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2018), however, found genetic differences among eels captured in different rivers in Japan, providing some evidence to the contrary. However, Gong <em>et al</em>. (2019) did not find any genetic population differentiation between eels from China and Japan, suggesting the weight of evidence still supports panmixia at present. </span></span></span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Several studies using microsatellite analysis have suggested that Japanese Eel elvers show little genetic variation between years. A genetic study carried out by Tseng <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2003), for example, suggests that the effective population size (EPS) of the Japanese Eel is declining and the authors speculate that historically this has been due to large scale oceanographic changes. While EPS does not offer a true measure of the number of mature, reproductive individuals in the population, a reduction in this value suggests an overall loss of adaptive genetic variation. </span></p><p>Catch effort can be variable in fishing data, and under-reporting and, in some cases, an absence of reporting of landings, is a serious problem across the range of <em>A. japonica</em>. Thus, landings data of glass eels cannot be accepted as a precise measure of population status (Kaifu 2019). However, due to the large scale of landings data, it can to some extent reflect true changes in fishing yields and is still helpful to understand stock status. </p><p>To date, there is only one published stock assessment study of <em>A. japonica</em>. This study, by Tanaka <em>et al</em>. (2014), estimated stock size through ‘exploitable’ (yellow and silver) eel CPUE for Japanese inland waters, glass eel CPUE in Japan, and an age- and sex-structured model. Results from this study estimated that stock size of individuals aged ≥1 year had recovered since 1990 from less than 10,000 tonnes (t), to 18,700 t in 2010, equating to 24% of the carrying capacity. A study by Kaifu (2019) discussed some of the challenges facing a stock assessment of <em>A. japonica</em>. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) glass eel catches occur in Japan, making it difficult to assess the stock using this life stage, as the catch cannot be translated directly into recruitment (Kaifu 2019). For example, glass eel catch during the 2014 fishing season (1 November 2013 to 31 October 2014) totalled 17.4 t in Japan, but the total reported catch was only 8.0 t, 46.0% of the actual (Kaifu 2019). Other challenges arise when using catch statistics for yellow and silver eels. Particularly in inland waters where fisheries occur in Japan, stocking is known to take place, which biases eel abundance and their natural biological parameters. Using recently developed methods based on otolith stable isotope ratios (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>a</em>), research is beginning to highlight the scale of the presence of stocked eels in inland waters, and the necessity for their consideration within stock assessments (Ministry of Environment 2016, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu 2019).</p><p><strong>Glass Eels: </strong></p><p>The data sets used in the analysis were as follows: Ministry of Agriculture, Forest and Fisheries (MAFF) compiled glass eel data (Japan), CPUE (catch/fisherman) data sets collected from nine Japanese prefectures; Chiba, Aichi, Tokushima, Oita, Kagoshima, Shizuoka, Mie, Kochi, and Miyazaki. Glass eel catch in these prefectures accounted 70.5% of the entire reported glass eel catch in Japan in 2018 fishing season (November 2017 to October 2018).</p><p>According to MAFF statistics, inland and coastal area glass eel catch reported in Japan in 19<span class=""msoins0"">95 and 2019 – three generation lengths difference - was 20.0 t and 3.7 t, respectively, with large fluctuations between years. Indeed, at the time of writing, the catch in 2020 was higher than in 2019. However, fisheries catch does not necessarily reflect the abundance of the population because of potential fluctuation of fisheries effort. </span></p><p>Glass eel CPUE (glass eel catch per fisherman) in nine different Japanese prefectures <a name=""_Hlk8914205"">(data from Tanaka (2014) updated based on communications with the nine prefectures) in 1994 and 2018 was 0.4483 and 0.2365, respectively.</a> CPUE has decreased by 47.2% over 24 years (three generations). Based on GLM analysis, the glass eel CPUE in the nine prefectures has significantly decreased for both periods of 1977–2018 and 2003–2018 (Kaifu and Yokouchi 2019).</p><p>The estimate of exploitation rate of glass eel (or elver) in an estuary in northern Taiwan indicated that this life stage was heavily fished, which will influence the population size of yellow/silver eels in the river (Tzeng 1984, Lin <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2017b, Lin and Tzeng 2018). </p><p><strong>Yellow/Silver Eels: </strong></p><p>The most recent FAO statistics (in 2017) suggest that landings are as low as 119 t although there is no indication of effort from these data (FAO 2019). In 2013 the Japanese Eel was assessed as 'Endangered' on the Japanese Red List (published by the Ministry of Environment, based on the catch data of inland eels compiled by the MAFF). This report indicated&#160;a 72–92% decline in the species over three generations (12–45 years). Total annual yellow and silver eel catch across the 47 prefectures significantly decreased from 1,413 t to 71 t during 1987–2017, a&#160;reduction of 95.0% over three generations (Anon. 1958–2018). A recent study using otolith Strontium isotope ratios (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr) reported that the otolith ratios of spawning adult Japanese Eels captured at the spawning area were most similar to the ratios of Japanese water, rather than that of Korea, mainland China and Taiwan waters (Otake <em>et al</em>. 2019)<span class=""apple-converted-space"">. This indicates population dynamics of yellow and silver eels in Japan might be an appropriate indicator of the whole population dynamics<span class=""apple-converted-space""> of <em>A. japonica</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. Although the MAFF data suggest widespread declines across the 47 prefectures of Japan (Anon. 1958–2018), the data only consider eels in inland waters, i.e. rivers/lakes, and it is estimated that &#160;56–86% of Japanese Eels remain in estuarine/saline waters throughout their lives (<a name=""_Hlk17362227"">Tsukamoto and Arai 2001, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2002, Arai <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kotake <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mochioka <em>et al</em>. 2012, Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2012</a>). It has been suggested that a latitudinal cline exists, in the degree to which Japanese Eels utilise either freshwater or saline environments in Japan and Taiwan (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009). In southern regions, a higher proportion of eels enter freshwater habitats, whereas in northern regions more eels remain in saline habitats (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009). This behaviour appears to coincide with productivity, and therefore food abundance, which is greater in marine environments in the north, and similarly in freshwater environments in the south (Tsukamoto and Arai 2001, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009). </span></p><p><a name=""_Hlk8918551"">It is suggested that eel stocking in Japan has biased</a> assessments of the population dynamics of this species (Kaifu 2019). Otolith stable isotopes have been recently used to determine the proportion of stocked eels in some locations in Japan. In Okayama prefecture, 98.1% of sampled eels in three rivers where stocking had occurred were identified as stocked individuals (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>). In the Tone River watershed, wild eel proportions differed with site, and dominance of stocked eels was highest closest to release sites, suggesting reduced dispersal of these individuals (Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2018). A study by the Ministry of Environment of Japan found 62% of eels (n = 92) captured from 10 water systems in Japan to be stocked after application of a discrimination model (Ministry of Environment 2016, in: Kaifu 2019). Stocking affects population dynamics by introducing additional individuals into wild eel populations. Moreover, in an age-based cohort model, stocking-related ageing error strongly affected estimates of total biomass (Kullmann <em>et al</em>. 2018). <a name=""_Hlk7699981"">Data on eel biological characteristics, such as survival rate, growth rate and sex ratio, are essential for assessments of their population dynamics (e.g.</a> Tanaka 2014); however, these characteristics can differ significantly between naturally recruited wild and cultured-and-stocked eels (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>, Kaifu 2019). Therefore, yellow and silver eel population dynamics should be investigated where the possible bias of eel stocking is expected to be relatively low to minimise error.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk7699853"">Japanese Eels are fished in both inland and coastal waters in Japan</a>, while eel stocking has been conducted only in inland waters. <a name=""_Hlk7699872"">The standardised yellow and silver eel CPUE was significantly decreased in four of the six fisheries cooperative associations in coastal and estuarine areas of Japan (Kaifu and Yokouchi 2019). Significant relationships between CPUE and year were not found for the other two associations. </a>Catches between 2003 and 2016 in coastal waters of Okayama Prefecture, where naturally-recruited wild eels are dominant, peaked in November and December (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>). This is when Japanese Eels start their spawning migration, although monthly catch and peak values were found to decrease over time, and longline and setnet CPUE decreased between 2003 and 2016 by 79.6%, and 79.5% respectively (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>). In addition, a survey of 1,509 fisheries cooperative associations in Japanese coastal waters where stocking of eels has not taken place reported that 93.4% of the 227 fisheries cooperative associations that confirmed they catch eels stated that they believe the Japanese Eel stock to be declining or relatively declining (Kaifu and Yokouchi 2019). </p><p>Han and Tzeng (2006) report an 81–88% female bias in sex ratio of yellow and silver eels caught at one locality, the Kaoping River, in south-western Taiwan. Furthermore, in the lower reaches of this river, density was revealed to be 0.01 eels/m²&#160;in 2001 and 2002 and the estimated abundance of eels in Kaoping River ranged from 7,137 to 31,360 individuals in 2001, and from 3,324 to 22,040 individuals in 2002 (Han and Tzeng 2006). Studies have found males to dominate at higher densities and so the low density and female bias in this River supports this theory (Han and Tzeng 2006). </p><p>                            </p><p>When considering all the available data on its multiple life-history stages, <em>A. japonica</em> is estimated to have suffered at least a 50% population decline over a period of three generations (24 years; see ‘Habitat and Ecology’).&#160;</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>It is known that <em>Anguilla japonica</em> occurs as a native species in Japan, China, Taiwan, Province of China (hereafter referred to as Taiwan) and Republic of Korea (hereafter referred to as South Korea). The range of this species extends from the Pacific coast of Japan and south to Hainan Island covering large areas of mainland China, Taiwan and South Korea. There are some records of recruitment along the coasts of the Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea and in low abundance in Northern Luzon Island, Philippines, the Chao Phraya basin in Thailand and Cambodia. It is thought that these vagrant individuals might not contribute greatly to the population as they are outside the influence of currents that are essential to the successful completion of the life cycle.</p><p>Eggs and preleptocephali for this species have been collected in the North Equatorial Current (NEC) along the western side of the West Mariana Ridge (14–17<sup>o</sup>N, 142–143<sup>o</sup>E) to the west of the Mariana Islands and were captured during new moon periods (Tsukamoto 2006, 2009, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2014). Timings of egg and preleptocephali catch also overlapped with catch of breeding-condition adult eels from the same area, confirming this area, west of the Mariana Islands, as the spawning location for this species (Chow <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kurogi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The possible spawning depth of adult eels has been suggested to lie in a vertically narrow depth stratum of 150–200 m, just below the upper limit of the thermocline sitting at 150 m (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The NEC and Kuroshio Current are the predominant transport mechanisms for this species (Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2012) but the latitude of spawning events, varies between years depending upon oceanic conditions (Kimura and Tsukamoto 2006, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2014). Spawning is thought to occur between April and August (Shinoda <em>et al</em>. 2011). The early, vagrant recruitment of Japanese glass eels occurs around the north-eastern coast of Luzon Island in the Philippines in late October and then in greater abundance in Taiwan in early November, with the main fishing season there being between November and February (Han 2011). After two to four weeks, recruitment occurs in the Fujian Province of China and the Pacific coast of southern Japan, where the main fishing season is between December and February (Han 2011). In the Zhejiang and Guangdong Provinces of China, Jeju Island, and Pacific coast of central Japan, the main fishing season occurs between January and March (Han 2011). From February to April, recruitment is concentrated in the southern Jiangsu Province of China (around Yangtze River estuary), the southern coast of South Korea, and east coast of Japan (Han 2011). In the northern Jiangsu Province of China and the west coast of South Korea, the main fishing seasons are between March and May (Han 2011). The final recruits occur on the north-western coast of South Korea and the Yalu River estuary in northern China between April and June (Cheng and Tzeng 1996, Han 2011, Han <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, recruitment peaks have been observed in June in 2010 and 2011 in the Pacific coast of central Japan (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2012). The results indicate that variations in the recruitment season may occur. &#160;</p><p>    </p><p>The natural range of <em>A. japonica</em> within countries such as Japan is difficult to determine because of widespread restocking activities. Recently, coastal regions of Kyushu, Seto Inland Sea, and in Honshu, the Pacific side south of Aomori Prefecture, and the Sea of Japan side south of Kyoto Prefecture, were identified as the main areas of distribution for naturally recruited yellow-phase <em>A. japonica</em> in Japan (Yoneta <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, South Korea and China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>Together with <em>A. anguilla</em> (the European Eel), <em>A. japonica</em> has one of the longest histories of fishing, stocking and farming for consumption purposes of all the <em>Anguilla</em> species. Japanese Eels are utilized/traded live, fresh, smoked, canned and frozen and eaten steamed, broiled and baked and also to some extent in East Asian medicines.&#160;<em>A. japonica</em> was historically caught in waters throughout its range, with large eels caught destined directly consumption or juvenile eels destined for farming, from the early 1900s onwards (Shiraishi and Crook 2015). </p><p>Global FAO catch data for the Japanese Eel is available for the period of 1950–2017. From the 1950s to 1986, annual catches (not life stage specific) fluctuated between 2,000 and 3,600 tonnes (t) (in 1969), averaging 2,600 t per year. From 1987 onwards reported catches gradually declined by 50–100 t on average per year, and in 2017 they were only 119 t. Over 90% of these catches were reported by Japan, with Taiwan and South Korea only reporting small quantities, and mainland China none. See ‘Population’ section for more detailed and national catch statistics for <em>A. japonica</em>.</p><p>According to FAO data, total annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production (catch and aquaculture) has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 t), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity and producing glass eels is not yet commercially viable. The preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em> and high demand for this declining resource has resulted in dramatic increases in price for this species. According to the Joint Press Release (Anonymous 2017) and other sources<em> </em>annual <em>A. japonica</em> glass eel input into farms in mainland China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan between 2008 and 2017 has declined significantly, however with some fluctuations between years (due to large variations in <em>A. japonica</em> glass eel recruitment), e.g. input was 24.1 t in 2012–2013, &#160;but then 98.5 t in 2013–2014. Declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years and this is particularly apparent during poor <em>A. japonica </em>recruitment years such as in 2012–2013 (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). See Shiraishi and Crook (2015) and Gollock <em>et al. </em>(2018) for a detailed analysis of <em>Anguilla</em> spp. and <em>A. japonica </em>farming production.</p><p>        </p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms, and <em>A. japonica</em> is believed to make up a significant proportion<em> </em><em>of this</em>. A detailed analysis of recent international <em>Anguilla</em> trade, including <em>A. japonica</em> is provided in Gollock <em>et al. </em>(2018).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><p>Due to their broad geographic range and multiple life stages, conservation measures for <em>Anguilla japonica</em> can be challenging to implement. Research resources appear to have been focused on the aquaculture and ecology of oceanic life stages, although some recent studies have begun to address population dynamics (e.g. Tanaka 2014, Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2014, Fisheries Agency 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>, Kaifu 2019), habitat restoration (e.g. Chen <em>et al</em>. 2014, Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2014, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>, Ministry of the Environment 2016, Kume <em>et al</em>. 2019) and restocking (e.g. Lin <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>a</em>, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2018) in order to promote conservation and sustainable use of Japanese Eels. </p><p>In 2003, a study was published documenting the first successful captive production of glass eels in Japan from reared larvae and the life cycle was fully closed in 2010 (Masuda <em>et al. </em>2012). For mass production of eels in Japan to become biologically and economically viable, however, better feed, disease prevention and a simplification and shortening of the rearing process are still required (Masuda <em>et al. </em>2012). In 2014, the Alliance for Sustainable Eel Aquaculture (ASEA) was established by Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan, under the structure of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), to increase collaboration, and discuss effective laws relating to eel resource conservation and management (Tzeng 2016). </p><p>In Japan, catch of juvenile eels is only permitted with a license, which is issued in order to capture seed for aquaculture or research within a limited fishing period. Illegal and unreported catch still remains a significant problem, with this catch potentially representing at least double the legal reported catch (Kaifu 2019). The capture of silver eels is prohibited or restricted in ten prefectures and voluntarily suspended in eight other prefectures, with the aim of&#160;preserving spawning eels in these areas. Restocking rivers and lakes with young eels for stock enhancement has also been carried out for many years in Japan.<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> However, stocking can disrupt population dynamics, through differences in survival and growth rates, and sex ratios between cultured/stocked and naturally-recruited wild individuals (Kaifu 2019). It may be that moving eels from one location to stock another, results in an inability to migrate to the spawning area (Westin 2003). The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) concluded that huge knowledge gaps still exist as to the benefits of stocking, and further research and consistent monitoring is necessary to better assess and understand the effects (ICES 2016). </p><p>In China, the numbers of fishing licenses are restricted. In Taiwan, a regulation to control export of juvenile eel was introduced in 2007, banning export between November and March (Shiraishi and Crook 2015). The last available information for glass eels used for farming showed in 2014–15 the harvesting period was reduced to four months (1<sup>st</sup> November 2014–28<sup>th</sup> February 2015) (Shiraishi and Crook 2015).&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">With a view to protect eel habitat, Yilian County, historically the major glass eel harvest region, has prohibited fishing (Han 2018). In addition, catch of young and larger eels has already been prohibited in 33 rivers of other regions (Han 2018). Regulations have been amended with regard to the control of eel farming activities since November 2014 (Han 2018). The Fisheries Agency reviews and updates the amount of glass eels to be input by fish farmers annually, and each fish farmer is subject to the control and management of a license system and individual input limit (Han 2018). The upper limit for glass eel input for Japanese Eel is set at 10 metric tons (Han 2018). Japanese Eel are also stocked into rivers (Han 2018). <em>Anguilla japonica</em> has recently been listed on the Red List of Taiwan as Nationally Critically Endangered (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2017).</span></p><p>At the international level, co-operation among Japan, China and Taiwan began in 2012, who aimed to establish strengthened management of Japanese Eel fisheries as well as the introduction of traceability schemes. In September 2014, a ‘Joint Statement’ was adopted by China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, for the conservation and management of the Japanese Eel, through a restriction on the amount of eel seed that can be used in aquaculture production annually (Anonymous&#160;2014).&#160;Based on the Joint Statement (Anonymous&#160;2014), the annual input of Japanese Eel seed since the 2015 season (1 November 2014–31 October 2015) has been limited to 78.8 t, 80% of the input in the 2014 season. The same input quota has been still in place up to the 2020 season (Fisheries Agency of Japan 2019<em>b</em>). The actual quantities reportedly used for aquaculture were lower than the quota: 37.8 t and 40.8 t in the 2015 and 2016 seasons, respectively (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019).

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>This shortfin eel species has a widespread distribution, although is not the most abundant species in many of these localities. There are a variety of documented threats within the range of <em>A. bicolor </em>that may be affecting the population, although there is limited information on the scale of the impact. Possible threats include barriers to migration (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2011), and associated turbine mortality (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>a</em>), habitat loss, poor water management, mining (Ame <em>et al.</em> 2013), pollution (Muhammad <em>et al</em>. 2012, Abbas <em>et al</em>. 2017, Octaviano 2017), and unsustainable exploitation (Gollock <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160; </p><p>Due to declines in the abundance and availability of both&#160;<em>A. japonica</em> and <em>A. anguilla</em> - species which have traditionally been used for farming and consumption - <em>A. rostrata</em>, and <em>A. bicolor</em> are currently the next preferred species, with interest in, and demand for, <em>A. bicolor </em>in East Asia having increased over the last decade. Although there are little data available for estimating population changes in this species, based on the ready supply of glass eels, other life stages and products on online trading platforms and reported by Southeast Asian researchers, it is believed that the eels found in this region may be under considerably greater threat from increased exploitation. </p><p>      </p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor</em> is assessed as Near Threatened (NT) based on a suspected reduction in population size of close to 30% over the next 21 years (3 generations). Should it continue increasing, exploitation of the species may pose a significant threat to the population at a global scale. It is necessary to note, however, that there is no formal monitoring data for relative abundance of this species. It is therefore strongly advised that monitoring for <em>A. bicolor</em> be conducted across its range to better determine population status. As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal in conservation. <br/> <br/> Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> of November, 2018.</p><p></p>","<p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor</em> has been suggested to have two spawning locations in the Indian Ocean, one to the west of Sumatra (Jespersen 1942, Aoyama <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007, Kuroki <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007), and another to the east of Madagascar (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kuroki <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007, Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>A. bicolor </em>in the Pacific Ocean is thought to spawn somewhere in the North Equatorial Current region (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2018, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018). The growth rate of <em>A. bicolor</em> leptocephali collected in the eastern Indian Ocean, west of Sumatra, was slower than other tropical eels, such as <em>A. celebesensis</em> or <em>A. borneensis</em>, suggesting that this subpopulation have a longer leptocephalus stage during oceanic migration (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2007). Year-round spawning has been suggested to occur for <em>A. bicolor </em>in the Indian Ocean (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2016, Arai and Kadir 2017<em>a</em>) and almost throughout the year in the Pacific (Sugeha <em>et al.</em> 2001, Sugeha <em>et al.</em> 2008). Individuals recruiting to Indonesia are thought to be coming from two or three different spawning seasons and/or sources, possibly including North and South Pacific spawning locations (Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2001, Sugeha and Suharti 2008, Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2008<em>,</em> Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/> <br/> This species has been observed to have elongate nostrils of a yellow/orange colour, that have been hypothesised to act as lures for prey (Tweddle and Skelton 2016). <em>A. bicolor</em> spends most of its life in estuaries, brackish waters, freshwater lakes, streams, pools and small rivers, preferring marshy habitats but can also be found over rock bottoms and in deeper pools (Pethiyagoda 1991). Chino and Arai (2010) found two patterns of habitat residence in eels from Segara Anakan, central Java Island in Indonesia. No eels were found to display solely freshwater residence, whilst 25% solely existed in either brackish or sea waters. The other 75% displayed habitat shifting between freshwater and either brackish or sea waters. In Africa this species is noted as preferring lowland coastal reaches of river systems (Skelton 1993) and in the Arabian Peninsula to wadis, estuaries and the coastal habitat (EPAA 2002). Similarly, in the Cagayan River, Philippines, it is thought that <em>A. bicolor</em> is found more commonly to reside in tributaries closer to the mouth of the river (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2018). In Vietnam, <em>A. bicolor</em> were found to show no freshwater residency during growth phase after analysis of Sr:Ca ratios suggesting either sea water or estuarine residency or migrating between brackish to sea (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2013). In a lagoon in Indonesia, individuals tended to migrate between freshwater and sea water with no constant freshwater residence (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2017). Hamzah <em>et al</em>. (2015) found most of the sampled <em>A. bicolor </em>in Peninsular Malaysia to display <a name=""_Hlk17467906"">high gonadosomatic indices</a>, suggesting they were ready to begin the spawning migration. This possibly indicates that they might remain entirely in freshwater before migration to the ocean to breed. However, Arai and Kadir (2017<em>b</em>) found <em>A. bicolor </em>to be widely distributed in both upstream to downstream areas of rivers in Peninsular Malaysia. Most recently, Arai and Chino (2019) investigated migratory history of <em>A. bicolor </em>collected in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. <em>A. bicolor </em>in Indonesia and Viet Nam were found to be either marine or brackish resident, whereas in Malaysia, it was freshwater resident (Arai and Chino 2019). Overall <em>A. bicolor </em>appears to show opportunistic, flexible habitat use and migration strategy during the growth phase, possibly in response to local conditions. </p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor</em> can grow to a maximum size of 1.1 m (Gomon and Bray 2017). However, while this species can live for up to 20 years, the average age of silvering is younger than those of temperate eels, suggesting that growth is faster (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2011). A variety of studies have examined the reproductive ecology of <em>A. bicolor </em>in Peninsular Malaysia. Arai <em>et al</em>. (2011) found age of female silver eels ranged between four and six years, with a total length of 497 to 636 mm, and weight ranging from 205 to 497 g. Another study found age at maturation of females ranged between 5.5 and 8.5 years, with body length and weight ranging from 411 to 720 mm and 126 to 1125 g, respectively (Chai and Arai 2018). On Penang Island off Peninsular Malaysia, migrating female silver eels were found to have an average total length and body weight of 651 mm, and 593 g respectively (Kadir <em>et al</em>. 2017). Glass eels of <em>A. bicolor </em>recruiting to Réunion Island in the western Indian Ocean were found to be 54 ± 2.1 mm long (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/> From research conducted on the Pacific subpopulation of <em>A. bicolor</em> in the Dumoga River, North Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, the ages of glass eels at recruitment to the coast ranged from 124 to 202 days, with hatching being estimated as having occurred between November and March (Arai <em>et al</em>. 1999). The duration of metamorphosis was estimated as 20 to 40 days (Arai <em>et al</em>. 1999). In the Poigar River, North Sulawesi, <em>A. bicolor </em>was only present in samples in January, March, April, October and December (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2001). Mean age at metamorphosis and recruitment was estimated to be 141 ± 20.9, and 173 ± 20.9 days, respectively (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2001). Based on year-round recruitment of glass eels at the Poigar River mouth, and age at recruitment remaining constant throughout the year, year-round spawning may exist for <em>A. bicolor</em> (Arai 2000, Arai 2001). </p><p>Average total length of <em>A. bicolor </em>glass eels recruiting to Mindanao, Philippines was 48.8 mm (45–52.3 mm) (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016). Two specimens of metamorphosing leptocephali - 42.6 and 46.3 mm - were reported off the Indonesian Archipelago and their ages were estimated as 106 and 112 days, respectively (Kuroki <em>et al.</em> 2006). During a sampling survey from Sumatra in 2003, <em>A. bicolor </em>leptocephali were collected west of Sumatra in the Mentawai Trench (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2007). Otolith microstructure of these larvae revealed size and age ranges of 44.1–55.5 mm and 114–158 days respectively (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2007). The transport of <em>A. bicolor </em>larvae is likely to be heavily influenced by the South Equatorial Current (SEC), the South Equatorial Counter Current (SECC) and the South Java Current (SJC) (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p><p>Kadir <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated the fecundity range (millions of eggs) for <em>A. bicolor </em>to be 0.6 to 5 and relative fecundity (millions of eggs per kilogram of body weight) was 3.1. </p><p>          </p><p><em>Note: <span class=""Accentuation"">Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em></p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are potentially less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>To date, few studies or surveys have considered the threats facing this species. Across the range of <em>A. bicolor</em>, there are documented threats affecting all anguillid eels. In Northern Luzon, Philippines, there is concern over pollution resulting from agricultural run-off, sediment erosion and mining (Ame <em>et al.</em> 2013). Farming practices occur along the Cagayan River, and run-off may well be affecting eels in this aquatic system (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2018). In Sulawesi, mining for gold takes place, possibly affecting anguillid species in this area through mercury pollution (Muhammad <em>et al</em>. 2012, Abbas <em>et al</em>. 2017, Octaviano 2017). Anguillid eels have been suggested as reliable indicators of contaminant concentrations within surface waters (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>b</em>). In a study on <em>A. bicolor </em>from Malaysia, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc were found below the acceptable limits of heavy metal pollution in fish and shellfish, although lead was higher than the global standard (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>b</em>). Even at low levels, heavy metals are toxic (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>b</em>), and <a name=""_Hlk10034760"">can impact anguillids metabolism, in some cases leading to mortality</a> (Le <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>Major impoundments and weirs are barriers to upstream eel movement in all countries within <em>A. bicolor</em>’s range (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2011) and mortalities can occur during the downstream passage of silver eels through turbines and pumps, and impingement on intake screens. For example, an irrigation dam in the Karau River, Malaysia, may prevent upstream/downstream movement of yellow stage <em>A. bicolor </em>(Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>a</em>). In the Poso river watershed in Indonesia, dams for hydropower and unsustainable harvest of glass and larger eels are two reported threats (Watupongoh and Krismono 2015). <a name=""_Hlk10102978"">Non-native species now found in many systems in South Africa, such as the predatory bass (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) and catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), present a threat to eels and other recruiting fish (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</a></p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, understanding of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited. The Philippines are significantly affected by typhoon activity, which has been increasing, most likely as a result of climate change (Holden and Marshall 2018) and may have the potential to reduce habitat quality. Significant localised damage caused by typhoon activity has been observed in some tributaries of the Cagayan River system (M. Gollock pers. comm.). </p><p>Parasitic infection by the invasive swim bladder nematode <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> has also been observed in <em>A. mossambica, A. bicolor </em>and<em> A. marmorata</em> from Reunion (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). Two <em>A. marmorata </em>(n = 80), one <em>A. bicolor</em> (n = 23) and one <em>A. mossambica</em> (n = 15) were infected (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). While the infection prevalence was low in these samples, this parasite is known to spread extremely quickly (Kirk 2003).</p><p>            </p><p>A major concern for <em>A. bicolor</em>, is believed to be the growing exploitation of this species across much of its range, particularly for glass eels (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018).<em> </em>Over the last decade<em> A. bicolor</em>&#160;has been fulfilling some of the demand for eels for consumption in East Asia driven by declines in other species (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015, Nijman 2015, Shiraishi and Crook 2015). Increasing exploitation is expected to continue due to the reduced availability of <em>A. japonica</em> and <em>A. anguilla</em> in particular, and there are concerns over illegal trade from several countries in Southeast Asia where glass eel exports are not permitted (see Conservation). In a study investigating illegal trade in the Philippines, <em>A. bicolor </em>made up 87% (20 out of 23) of randomly selected elvers identified after confiscation - the remaining three were identified as <em>A. marmorata </em>(Asis <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p>There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla bicolor</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects as a result of the identified threats, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</p><p>In historic studies conducted in southern Sri Lanka, the population was stated to be relatively stable as reflected in the catch per unit effort (Wickström and Enderlein 1988, Wickström 2006).&#160;Population densities of this species are very low in the Arabian Peninsula (EPAA 2002).&#160;In the Philippines, multiple species of glass eels, including <em>A. bicolor</em>, recruit to the coast and abundances appear to fluctuate annually and regionally (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2015, Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016). </p><p>Sugeha <em>et al</em>. (2001) studied the inshore migration of glass eels to the Poigar River estuary (North Sulawesi, Indonesia) over a three-year period from 1997–1999. <em>A.</em><em> bicolor</em> was found to recruit almost year-round, although in the lowest abundance compared to <em>A. celebesensis</em>, and <em>A. marmorata </em>(Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2001). <em>A. bicolor </em>made up only 2.7, 1.7, and 0.3% of the annual catch, respectively (Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2001). In contrast, <em>A. bicolor</em> was recorded to be the dominant species recruiting to the estuary of Palu River (West Sulawesi, Indonesia) from 2006 to 2007, compared to <em>A. marmorata </em>and <em>A. celebesensis</em> (Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2008). Aoyama <em>et al</em>. (2015) sampled glass eels in the Cagayan River, Philippines, from 2008 to 2009, and again in 2011 to 2012. In 2008–2009, <em>A. bicolor</em> made up only 3.9% (of 8,643 glass eels), which increased to 29.5% (of 23,535 glass eels) in 2011–2012 (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2015). Another study in the Cagayan River system conducted monitoring over a twelve-month period from May 2015 to May 2016 and found <em>A. bicolor</em> to make up only 10% of recruitment in a mixed system with <em>A. marmorata</em> (44%), and <em>A. luzonensis</em> (46%) (Zoological Society of London, unpub. data.) In the Pangi River, Maitum Sarangani Province, Philippines, <em>A. marmorata</em> was dominant, making up ~97% (4,118 of 4,262 eels) of catch, whereas <em>A. bicolor</em> was less common, only making up ~3% (139 of 4,262 eels) (Valdez and Castillo 2016). In Southern Mindanao, Philippines, glass eels were collected over a year period between April 2014 and May 2015, <em>A. bicolor</em> was the second most abundant species, making up 19.5% of catch (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>In Palabuhan Ratu, Indonesia, eel catch and effort data (CPUE) has been recorded since November 2013 (SEAFDEC 2018). This data is not species specific, however it has been suggested that the dominant species caught in the Cimandiri River is <em>A. bicolor </em>(SEAFDEC 2018). Although there is no overall trend across this time series, there are three periods where CPUE peaked; October 2014 to September 2015, October 2015 to September 2016, and January to April 2017 (SEAFDEC 2018). In a study of glass eels recruiting to Palu River in Sulawesi, <em>A. marmorata</em> was dominant, constituting just over half of catch (51%), <em>A. bicolor</em> made up 36% (Serdiati <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p><p>        </p><p><a name=""_Hlk14865245"">In Réunion, <em>A. bicolor</em>, as well as other recruiting anguillid eels (<em>A. bengalensis</em>, <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>), are classified as ‘Critically Endangered’ under the regional Red List (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009). Listed threats include fisheries (target species and bycatch), habitat loss, construction of barriers to migration, and parasites (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;</a></p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor</em> has diverged between the Indian and Pacific Oceans giving rise to two subpopulations (Ege 1939). The subpopulation found in the Indian Ocean (sometimes referred to as <em>A. bicolor bicolor</em>) is genetically homogeneous in this ocean, but significantly different from that in the Pacific Ocean (sometimes referred to as <em>A. bicolor pacifica</em>) (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2012). There is also continued debate about whether the Indian Ocean subpopulation might also be considered as two separate management units (K. Tsukamoto pers. comm. 2014). Watanabe <em>et al</em>. (2014) suggested each spawning population “should be considered a distinct ecological unit for conservation and sustainable management”.<br/> <br/> The Pacific subpopulation is native to the coasts of mainland China (hereafter China), Taiwan, Province of China (hereafter Taiwan), Viet Nam (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Hue, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Nha Trang (Nguyen 2018)) (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2011), Philippines (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the islands of Borneo, Sulawesi Island, New Guinea, and the Marianas (Tesch 2003 in Nguyen 2018). In Taiwan, it has been suggested to be an occasional species with low abundance (Leander <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hong <em>et al</em>. (2017) recently identified one specimen in the Republic of Korea (hereafter South Korea) waters. A study by Sugeha and Suharti (2008) conducted around the Indonesian Archipelago, found <em>A. bicolor</em> to be distributed along the archipelago from the west to the east.&#160;<em>A. bicolor</em> recruited in Sulawesi, Halmahera, and West Papua Islands of eastern Indonesian archipelago (Sugeha and Suharti 2008).<br/> <br/> The Indian Ocean subpopulation is distributed from the east coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula (Oman and Yemen, including Socotra, in coastal drainages of the Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Aden (EPAA 2002)), it is widespread in the tropical Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Madagascar and Mascarenes), east to India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar. It is found across to northwestern Australia but known only from streams in the Kimberley regions of northwestern Western Australia and Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2002). In Indonesia, <em>A. bicolor</em> has been found to recruit to Sumatra and Java Islands of the western Indonesian archipelago (Sugeha and Suharti 2008, Sugeha and Genisa, 2015, Muchlisin <em>et al</em>. 2017, Suryati <em>et al</em>. 2018). A number of recent studies also support the occurrence of <em>A. bicolor </em>from the Indian Ocean subpopulation in the Malaysian Peninsula (Arai <em>et al.</em> 2012<em>a</em>, 2015; Hamzah <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arai and Wong 2016, Arai and Kadir 2017<em>b</em>). In Africa, it is widespread but relatively uncommon along the east and southeast African coast from South Africa to Tanzania and Madagascar, including the Lower Shire River System of the Lower Zambezi in Malawi (Tweddle and Willoughby 1979) and Tana River in Kenya (Copley 1958). In a study identifying eels from Madagascar and surrounding islands, <em>A. bicolor</em> was the only anguillid species collected in the Seychelles archipelago (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/> <br/> The exact spawning locations of <em>Anguilla bicolor</em> are unknown. Studies have long thought the spawning location of <em>A. bicolor </em>in the Indian Ocean lies to the west of Sumatra above the Mentawai Trench (Jespersen 1942, Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Aoyama <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007, Kuroki <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007). A second western spawning location has been hypothesised to exist to the east of Madagascar (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kuroki <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007, Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although, the utilisation of a single spawning area is supported by a population structure showing this species to be genetically homogenous throughout the Indian Ocean (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2012, Fahmi 2013). It is therefore likely that eels in the southwest Indian Ocean may be coming from the same spawning area as those recruiting to Sumatra (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008). <em>A. bicolor </em>in the Pacific Ocean<em> </em>is thought to spawn somewhere in the North Equatorial Current region, near the Mariana Ridge, possibly overlapping or near to that of <em>A. japonica</em> (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2018, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, South Korea and China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). <a name=""_Hlk17384264""><em>Anguilla bicolor </em>was increasingly used to stock farms in East Asia from 2010 onwards (after <em>A. anguilla </em>was listed in CITES Appendix II in 2009 and the EU banned all trade in <em>A. anguilla </em>from and to the EU), and in particular when the price of <em>A. japonica </em>glass eels increased dramatically due to shortages in 2011–2013.</a></p><p>According to East Asian Customs data, between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~220 t of live eel fry for farming (glass eels and larger juveniles) from eight countries in south-east/south Asia (&gt;70% from the Philippines), reaching a peak of around 64 t in 2013, and 14 t from Africa (99% from Madagascar, see below). China and South Korea farming input data includes some specific records of “<em>A. bicolor </em><em>+</em><em>” </em>(believed to include mainly <em>A. bicolor, </em>but also some other tropical species): in mainland China “<em>A. bicolor +</em><em>” </em>input gradually increased from 0.3 t in 2008–2009, reaching a peak of 13.5 t in 2013–2014; South Korea also began to use <em>A. bicolor </em>in 2010–2011, input reaching a peak of 6.7 t in 2012–2013. Both trade and farming input data suggest that the demand for <em>A. bicolor </em>and other tropical eels in East Asia has declined since 2014 as successful farming techniques for <em>A. bicolor </em>and other species have not yet been fully developed (Fan and Qin 2016, Back and Park 2017). However, there appears to have been an increase in <em>A. bicolor </em>farming in Indonesia and the Philippines in recent years (SEAFDEC 2018). It should also be noted that exports of glass eels from most south-east Asian countries are not currently permitted (see Conservation).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160; </p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor </em>is found in subsistence and commercial fisheries and in international trade, however as its range overlaps with many other anguillids, species specific data is very limited. At best it is reported as an approximate percentage of catch/trade and only available for part of its range. Within south-east Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines are currently the principal <em>Anguilla</em> catching, farming and trading nations (SEAFDEC 2018). Annual catches of “River eels nei” (other eel species not included elsewhere in FAO fishery statistics) in Indonesia and the Philippines fluctuated between 1355 and 6125 t between 2008 and 2017, averaging over 3000 t per year. According to national surveys coordinated by SEAFDEC, in 2017 total Indonesian glass eel catch (a mix of <em>A. bicolor </em>and <em>A. marmorata</em>) was ~20 t, and annual elver and yellow eel catches in 2015 and 2016 (no data available for 2017) was ~700 t (SEAFDEC 2018). The mouth of the Cimandiri River in Sukabumi Regency is considered to be one of the largest glass eel fishing grounds in Indonesia, with more than 1,500 part-time fishermen active in the peak season (Honda <em>et al. </em>2016). Fahmi and Hirnawati (2010) concluded that 86% of the glass eel caught in the Cimandiri River was <em>A. bicolor</em>.&#160; There are 12 eel farms currently operating in Java, and 90% of total production (354 t in 2015 and 511 t in 2016) is reportedly <em>A. bicolor </em>(SEAFDEC 2018). </p><p>In the Philippines, the main target species for fisheries is <em>A. bicolor, </em>however<em> </em>the main species caught in Luzon and Mindanao is <em>A. marmorata </em>(85–90% of all glass eels, 95% of yellow eels). 2017 glass eel catches were reported as 2.2 t in Luzon and 10.3 t Mindanao. There are 28 eel farms currently operating in the Philippines and in 2016 they produced 114 tonnes - 20% <em>A. marmorata </em>(exported to China, South Korea and Taiwan) and 80% <em>A. bicolor</em> (exported to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan). Apparently, farmers are specifically looking for species mixes with a high percentage of <em>A. bicolor</em>, glass eels are sorted and most of the <em>A. marmorata </em>is released back into the wild. In other south-east Asian nations, anguillid eel catch and use is small in comparison, and in many cases only as bycatch species, e.g. yellow eel bycatch in Myanmar was reported as 12 t in 2017 (90% <em>A. bicolor</em>, 10% <em>A. marmorata </em>or <em>A. bengalensis</em>). Due to the high diversity of tropical fish in south-east Asia and the perception that anguillid eels look like snakes and/or have mythical status (Mekong Fisheries Network 1999) domestic consumption is minimal, apart from in Viet Nam, which uses 50% of its anguillid production (95% <em>A. marmorata</em> and 5 % <em>A. bicolor</em> farmed from domestic glass eel catch, ~0.6–0.75 t a year) for domestic consumption (SEAFDEC 2018). In some parts of its range, such as Sri Lanka, <em>A. bicolor</em> is also reportedly used in the aquarium trade (Pethiyagoda 1991).</p><p>International trade in <em>Anguilla</em> commodities is reported from much of <em>A. bicolor’s </em>range, however, the species composition of shipments is unknown and could contain many different <em>Anguilla </em>species including <em>A. marmorata, A. bengalensis </em>and<em> A. mossambica. </em>According to UN Comtrade, exports of eel commodities (live, fresh, frozen and prepared eel) from south-east and south Asian countries increased from ~8,420 t in 2008 to 32,640 t in 2016, with live and frozen eels being the main commodities for export. However, live eel exports from south-east Asian countries in particular are known to include non-<em>Anguilla </em>eel species such as <em>Monopterus albus </em>(Swamp Eels) and <em>Pisodonophis </em>spp. (Gollock <em>et al.</em> 2018, SEAFDEC 2018). For example, verified exports from the Philippines in 2016 were only 48 t (all apparently identified as <em>Anguilla bicolor pacifica</em>), compared to the 8,423 t reported to UN Comtrade. Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius also exported <em>Anguilla </em>commodities between 2008 and 2017, with most exports being live and frozen eels from Madagascar (273 t) and South Africa (129 t). According to UN Comtrade, exports of live eels (all life stages) from Madagascar increased gradually from 4.6 t in 2004 to 8.8 t in 2009 and then in 2010 there was a dramatic increase in exports to over 45 t. From 2011 to 2015 annual exports fluctuated between 16t and 26 t, and in 2016 and 2017 they declined again to ~11 t. Companies trading in the southern and east Africa region declare that their glass and adult live eels are <em>A. mossambica</em> and that they are able to differentiate between species and control harvesting as glass eel recruitment is asynchronous, however exports to East Asia of live eels caught in Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa have been reported to include other species <a name=""_Hlk10101152"">(S.

In May 2012, as a precautionary measure by the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) legislation was enacted to prohibit the export of juvenile anguillid eels of a size less than 15 cm from the Philippines, (Crook 2014). In the Cagayan River, located in the north of Luzon island in the Philippines, an eel management plan has been developed (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2019). This has been proposed as a model for replication in other islands/regions, and even nationally (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2019). </p><p>Indonesia has legislation relating to export of glass eels that dates back to 1973; in October 2012 a new regulation came into force (Nijman 2015). The “Regulation on the Export of Glass Eels (<em>Anguilla</em> spp.) from the Republic of Indonesia (PP 19/2012)” stipulates that the individual mass of eels exported from Indonesia must equal or be larger than 150 g, and so despite its title, encompasses glass eels, elvers, and some yellow eels (Nijman 2015). In Vietnam Anguilla eel export is banned except for farmed eels (Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2018, a nine-year conservation and management plan for Anguillid eels in Réunion was produced (Valade <em>et al</em>. 2018). The plan covers the three species of eels found in this territory (<em>A. mossambica, A. bicolor, A. marmorata</em>) and aims to combat the impacts of poaching, fisheries, river habitat quality, and connectivity (Hanzen <em>et al</em>. in press).</p><p><a name=""_Hlk9241210"">The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states (AMSs) have, since 2015, established management initiatives for anguillid eels, which includes developing policy and research (SEAFDEC 2018).

This was held to address issues on data collection for eels in Southeast Asia, exchange </a>existing fisheries information, and discuss recommendations to improve the sustainability of anguillid eel fisheries across this range (SEAFDEC 2016). A number of recommendations were suggested, which included harmonising data collection methods, and strengthening regulations on eel trade (SEAFDEC 2016).

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p><em>Anguilla mossambica</em>&#160;is found in fresh and saline water habitats of East Africa, Madagascar and other West Indian Ocean island chains. Documented threats to this species include barriers to migration (Mafuca and Bills 2012), parasites&#160;(Sasal <em>et al</em>. 2008, Weyl&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, McHugh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017), and the growing exploitation of this species in Madagascar and South Africa, for export to Asia and Europe (Robinet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Gollock&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a decline in range of ~50% over three generations (30 years) has been estimated in some rivers in the province (C. Hanzen unpub. data). Elsewhere in South Africa, there is anecdotal evidence of declines in the Eerste River catchment in False Bay due to poor water quality, and the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay where recent records have only been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). In Réunion Island, this species occurs frequently in some rivers, whereas in Mayotte, <em>A. mossambica</em> are considered scarce (Valade <em>et al</em>. 2018, DEAL and OCEA 2019). Dam construction has also thought to have led to declines in Tanzania (Tamatamah 2012). In the Cahora Bassa Lake, Mozambique, eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) were found to be absent where historical studies had reported them as extant prior to dam construction (Mafuca and Bills 2012).</p>  <p>If observed range declines in some areas are reflected in other regions across the distribution of this species, there would be significant cause for concern. This, coupled with growing interest and demand for this species for farming and consumption, has led to&#160;<em>A. mossambica</em> being assessed as Near Threatened (NT). The listing for this species is based on inference from limited data across a small range and it is therefore strongly advised that monitoring for this species be conducted to better determine population status. As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal in conserving the population.</p>  <p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup>&#160;of November, 2018.</p><p></p>","<p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p>In South Africa this species inhabits a broad ecological niche, being found in rivers from the headwater to lower reaches (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015; Kadye and Booth 2019). Similar to other anguillids, <em>Anguilla mossambica</em> is catadromous, whereby a proportion of the growth phase (yellow eel) reside in freshwater and the other remaining in sea, coastal, or brackish habitats (Tsukamoto 1998, Lin <em>et al</em>. 2015). Elvers in the Eastern Cape, South Africa arrive in considerably higher numbers in the summer (November/December) than during the winter (June/July) or spring months (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Although yellow eels are usually fairly sedentary, otolith microchemistry suggests that some individuals in South Africa are inter-habitat migrants that move between freshwater and saline habitats (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012). In a later study using otolith Sr:Ca ratios, Lin <em>et al</em>. (2015) found 16.7% (n = 5) of individuals in the Maningory River, Madagascar, to exhibit freshwater residency, and 13.3% to be habitat-shifters (n = 4).</p><p>Females can attain lengths of up to 120 cm and are generally longer and heavier than males (Froese and Pauly 2011). This species is thought to remain in the yellow stage for 8–18 years before metamorphosing into the silver stage, prior to beginning the spawning migration (McEwan and Hecht 1984, Bruton <em>et al</em>. 1987 in Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015).</p><p>It has been suggested that spawning of this species occurs continuously between June and November in an area north-east of Madagascar and west of the Mascerene Ridge in the Indian Ocean (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008). The age of leptocephali increases as they are found further south of the proposed spawning area and it is suggested that individuals are transported by the South Equatorial Current (SEC) (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009b). The present continental range suggests a migration of 1,000 to 2,000 km from the proposed spawning area (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Of the three species that inhabit the Malagasy area (<em>A. mossambica</em>,&#160;<em>A. marmorata</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>A. bicolor</em>),&#160;<em>A. mossambica</em>&#160;have the slowest otolith growth rate due to its southernmost distribution (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>        </p><p>Note: <span class=""Accentuation"">Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</p><p></p>","<p><em>Anguilla mossambica</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; <span lang=""EN-US"">barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are potentially less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments.</p><p>Barriers to migration appear to be problematic in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with dams such as the Cahora Bassa and Kariba dams&#160;preventing migration (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Mafuca and Bills 2012). A study investigating fish diversity in the Cahora Bassa Lake, found eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) to be absent (Mafuca and Bills 2012). Historic studies had previously reported these species in this area prior to the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam (Mafuca and Bills 2012). However, in both the Sundays River (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Baakens River (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2015) in South Africa, <em>A. mossambica</em> was found upstream of the obstructions, and in both studies was the only species able to transverse the weirs. </p><p><a name=""_Hlk17467190"">In South Africa, poor water quality is anecdotally suggested to have caused eel species to become rare in some localities, such as the False Bay catchments, and few specimens remaining in this area have been observed to have severe skin lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Non-native species now found in many systems in South Africa, such as the predatory bass (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) and catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), may also have contributed to the decline (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</a></p><p>Fisheries for eels based in Madagascar, Mozambique, and South Africa appear to be increasing, and over the last 15 years, glass eels have been increasingly exported directly from Madagascar to East Asia (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). There are also concerns over illegal fishing and trade in the region (see Use and Trade). Weyl <em>et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that the trade of live <em>A. mossambica</em> may result in parasitic introductions into other regions, as a result of its rich parasitic fauna. In the Eastern Cape of South Africa this species is particularly vulnerable to a parasitic gill worm (<em>Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae</em>) (Parker <em>et al</em>. 2011, McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). This parasite has been shown to cause damage to gills resulting in impaired respiration (McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). Under aquaculture conditions, where fish are kept in high numbers, infection has led to mortalities (McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). <a name=""_Hlk17468384"">Parasitic infection by the invasive swim bladder nematode <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> has also been observed in <em>A. mossambica, A. bicolor </em>and<em> A. marmorata</em> from Reunion (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). Two <em>A. marmorata </em>(n = 80), one <em>A. bicolor</em> (n = 23) and one <em>A. mossambica</em> (n = 15) were infected (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). While the infection prevalence was low in these samples, this parasite is known to spread extremely quickly (Kirk 2003).</a></p><p>          </p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, our knowledge of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla mossambica</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects as a result of the identified threats, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</p><p>A study investigating niche patterns in native and non-native fish within The Great Fish River (South Africa) described <em>A. mossambica</em> as having broad environmental niches and being widespread (Kadye and Booth 2019), which is similar to what has been found in the Sundays River, Eastern Cape (Wassermann <em>et al</em>. 2012). In a study of 4099 glass eels sampled between April 2005 and February 2006 from rivers in Reunion, Mauritius, Mayotte, and Madagascar, 3790 <em>A. mossambica, </em>246 <em>A. marmorata</em>, and 63 <em>A. bicolor</em> were identifiable (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009a), indicating the latter was a small proportion of the recruitment to these islands at the time.</p><p>Other recent monitoring data has been collected from South Africa between 2015 and 2019, predominantly in KwaZulu-Natal (C. Hanzen unpub. data.). A comparison of historical (Scott <em>et al</em>. 2006, GBIF 2018) and current data from the samples collected across this province was carried out. Using this method, the decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) was 51% over three generation lengths, and 59% over the full time series (1959-2019). These records indicate a decline in distribution – and very likely abundance – of this species in some rivers of KwaZulu-Natal. This pattern, if reflected in other areas across the range of this species, would be significant cause for concern.</p><p>In some areas in South Africa, such as the Eerste River catchment in False Bay, eels were historically considered a problem species, and recruiting elvers caused blockages in irrigation pumps (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Since the 1970s, eels are no longer common in False Bay catchments; this has been suggested to be due to poor water quality (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). <a name=""_Hlk10104968"">In Tanzania, the decline in native eels (<em>A. bengalensis</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>) is thought to have begun in the 1980s, as a result of dam construction (Tamatamah 2012). Fishing surveys carried out over the past decade only found a few individual eels in comparison to pre-impoundment fish studies (Tamatamah 2012).</a> <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em> once occurred in the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay, although recent records have only been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S.

Along the east coast of Africa, <em>Anguilla mossambica</em> is found in rivers from Kenya south to Table Bay (South Africa), also found on Madagascar and other western Indian Ocean islands (Mascarene: Réunion and Mauritius Islands, Comoros:&#160;Mayotte Island and the Seychelles: Mahé and Praslin Islands). <em>Anguilla mossambica</em>,&#160;is also the most common anguillid species in the Eastern Cape, South Africa and in eastern Madagascar (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>  </p><p>Spawning is thought to occur in an area north-east of Madagascar and west of the Mascerene Ridge in the Indian Ocean (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan<a name=""_Hlk17467804"">, The Republic of Korea (hereafter South Korea) </a>and mainland China (hereafter China). A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global production of <em>Anguilla </em>has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). Being a plain-coloured eel, there has been an increase in interest in <em>A. mossambica </em>to stock farms in East Asia and elsewhere from 2010 onwards (after <em>A. anguilla </em>was listed in CITES Appendix II in 2009 and the EU banned all trade in <em>A. anguilla </em>from and to the EU), and in particular when the price of <em>A. japonica </em>glass eels increased dramatically due to shortages in 2011–2013.</p><p>According to East Asian Customs data, the first known records of imports of live glass eels into Asia from Africa are from 2005, and between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~14 t of live eel fry for farming (glass eels and larger juveniles) from Africa (99% from Madagascar). Live eel fry imports from Madagascar (believed to be mainly composed of <em>A. mossambica</em>) reached a peak of 5.6 t in 2013, after which they dropped to less than 600 kg in 2014 and 2015, with no imports recorded in 2016–2017. South Korea reported farming input 0.5 t of <em>A. mossambica </em>in 2012–2013 (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018); South Korea tried farming <em>A. mossambica </em>and <em>A. bicolor </em>when the price of <em>A. japonica </em>glass eels increased dramatically due to their shortage during 2011–2013, most of which was reportedly unsuccessful (Fan and Qin 2016, Back and Park 2017).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160;</p><p><em>Anguilla mossambica </em>is found in subsistence and commercial fisheries and in international trade, however as its range overlaps with many other anguillids, species specific data is very limited. No country from the species’ range has reported eel catch or farming data to FAO, however in recent years there has been a reported increase in interest in commercial harvesting of eels (all life stages) from South Africa, Mozambique and Madagascar, with a focus on <em>A. mossambica</em> for export to Europe and Asia. Illegal fishing and trade of glass eels has been reported from the region, and this has been linked to several applications for setting up eel farms in South Africa mainly using <em>A. mossambica</em> imported from Madagascar, all of which have been rejected by national authorities over concerns of disease, introduced parasites and population status (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). An increase in investment into fisheries and farming of eels in Madagascar and Mauritius, in particular of <em>A. mossambica</em>, has been reported over the last decade (FIS 2010, Farm Africa 2015) and Malagasy eel farmers are advertising their products on B2B marketplaces/trade platforms such as Alibaba.

Exports of live eels (all life stages) from Madagascar increased gradually from 4.6 t in 2004 to 8.8 t in 2009 and then in 2010 there was a dramatic increase in exports to over 45 t. From 2011 to 2015 annual exports fluctuated between 16t and 26 t, and in 2016 and 2017 they declined again to ~11 t. Companies trading in the southern and east Africa region declare that their glass and adult live eels are <em>A. mossambica</em> and that they are able to differentiate between species and control harvesting as glass eel recruitment is asynchronous. However, exports to East Asia of live eels caught in Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa have been reported to include other species (S.

It does well in large dams, where it breeds on rocky shorelines. It occurs in sympatry with the larger Orange-Vaal Largemouth Yellowfish but is more widespread, since it occurs at higher altitudes and in smaller tributary streams than the latter species (De Villiers and Ellender 2007). Migrates to suitable gravel beds and breeds in spring to midsummer after major summer rains. Omnivorous with benthic invertebrates, bivalve molluscs, vegetation, algae and detritus as major food sources (Skelton 2001). Like other African yellowfishes, it is slow growing, late maturing and long lived (O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2013). Recent telemetry work in the Vaal River has revealed home ranges of up to 5.5 km, but most fish tagged remained within an 800 m home range for extended periods (O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Potential hybridization between this species and other yellowfishes such as <em>Labeobarbus kimberleyensis&#160;</em>must be investigated further, since it can be caused by river regulation, interbasin water transfers and indiscriminant stocking of yellowfishes for angling purposes (de Villiers and Ellender 2007, Swartz 2007). Pollution, from poorly maintained Waste Water Treatment Plants at towns next to rivers, is an increasing problem in the Orange-Vaal River System, culminating in eutrophic instream dams and rivers (de Villiers and Ellender 2007). Major fish kills have occurred in recent years in the Vaal River due to sewage spillage (de Villiers and Ellender 2007), but there are many rivers and dams that provide good to excellent habitat and water quality, where this species is abundant and secure from pollution.

Habitat is characterized by a large amount of submerged and riparian vegetation which is used as cover to avoid predators (Jiménez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). It has also been collected from a section of the Sunes River characterized by shallow rapids with slow velocity and abundant riparian vegetation (Tobes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Diet is comprised of zooplankton and aquatic invertebrates (Jiménez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Maximum reported body size is 4.5 cm and 3.5 cm in females and males, respectively (Eigenmann 1922). Fertilization occurs internally and males are sexually dimorphic based on the presence of a gonopodium (Tortonese 1949, Jiménez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).","<p>Western Ecuador is heavily impacted by anthropogenic factors including habitat transformation for the development of agricultural fields and towns, the building of dams and creation of artificial reservoirs, habitat deterioration due to pollution, mining, and severe river bank modification (Aguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, 2021).</p>  <p>The Guayas River basin is subject to a number of anthropogenic stressors on local and regional scales (Loh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, 2018). In a basin-wide ecological water quality analysis, poor water quality was consistently detected around arable land and adjacent to residential areas (Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The Guayas River basin supports much of the Ecuador’s industrial scale agricultural production, has contributed to high concentrations of pesticide pollutants throughout the watershed (Deknock&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019, Cambien&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), and continues to drive deforestation as agricultural land-use expands (Borbor-Cordova&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Aguirre <em>et al.</em> 2021). Intensive grazing is a standard practice for cattle farming in the lower reaches of the drainage (Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The basin supports a human population of approximately 5.5 million inhabitants (Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Population growth and associated increases in urban expansion and industrial processes have degraded habitat quality around urban population centres (Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Rivera Vera 2017). Similar threats are present throughout much of the Santa Rosa River drainage (Aguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The agricultural industry in the Guayas River basin is based on monoculture systems, and contributes to the production of about 20% of bananas and 83% of rice for Ecuador (INEC 2016). Mining activity near the Guayas or Santa Rosa River basins presents a threat to aquatic species, including areas such as Ponce Enriquez where the mercury toxicity threshold was three times higher than the threshold recommended for the protection of aquatic life (Appleton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).</p>  <p>The primary threats to freshwater habitat in western Peru include runoff and pollution associated with urban centers, deforestation and pollution associated with unsustainable agricultural activities, and hydrological modification to support irrigation as urban and agricultural development continue (Ortega and Hidalgo 2008). Gold mining is the primary economic activity in the upper basin of the Puyango-Tumbes River basin (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Schudel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Amalgamation processing occurs primarily in the municipality of Portovelo, Ecuador, where byproducts and wastewater is discharged directly into the Puyango watershed (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Agricultural production and cattle ranching dominate the landscape in the middle and lower region of the basin, and include the production of bananas, rice, corn, fruit, chickens, goats, cattle, hogs, and sheep (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Coastal margins and the Tumbes River delta have been developed extensively for shrimp farming (Mialhe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p>  <p>Despite uncertainty regarding the direct impact of existing threats on <em>P. festae</em>, continuing decline in habitat quality is inferred.</p><p></p>",The total population size and population trend of this species are unknown.

177282313,161431,Urogymnus granulatus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2020,2015-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This is an amended version of the 2015 assessment to accommodate the change in genus from <em>Himantura </em>to <em>Urogymnus</em>.<br/><br/>The Mangrove Whipray (<em>Urogymnus </em><em>granulatus</em>) is a large-bodied (to 141 cm disc width), uncommon stingray, with a widespread distribution in the eastern Indian and western Pacific oceans, from Sri Lanka and eastern India, through to Indonesia. It also occurs along the northern coast of Australia and throughout some of the Pacific Islands. The species appears to prefer shallow inshore waters, including mangroves, estuaries, sand flats and broken rocky-sandy substrate, although adults may move offshore to at least 85 m depth.&#160;The species' preference for inshore habitats and the fact that it is apparently uncommon compared to other&#160;<em>Himantura&#160;</em>species, makes it particularly vulnerable to widespread and intensive artisanal and industrial fisheries operating throughout large areas of its range, as well as habitat destruction and pollution. Significant destruction and degradation of mangrove areas and targeting of juveniles in shallow waters are thought to have significantly affected this species. <br/><br/>It is caught irregularly by tangle net, bottom trawl (including large numbers of trawlers targeting rhynchobatids in the Arafura Sea) and longline fisheries and retained for human consumption. Levels of exploitation are very high throughout its range in Southeast Asia and in many parts of the Indian Ocean, hence it is under a severe level of threat within most of this range. Although no species-specific data are available, overall catches of stingrays are reported to be declining in areas of Southeast Asia for which information is available, with fishermen having to travel further and further to sustain catch levels. Species that inhabit a similar habitat to this species (such as the Sicklefin Lemon Shark (<em>Negaprion acutidens</em>)) are now rarely observed in Indonesia due to high levels of exploitation, and significant declines are also inferred to have occurred in the Mangrove Whipray in Indonesia and other areas.&#160;Given the continuation of high levels of exploitation throughout its range in Southeast Asia where the species is caught&#160;in multiple types of fisheries, along with evidence for declines in catches of rays,&#160;the level of&#160;decline (&gt;30% over the last three generations) and exploitation can be inferred from overall declines in fish catches in the region, as well as from habitat loss (in particular mangroves). <br/><br/>n Australia,&#160;the Mangrove Whipray is considered at minimal threat throughout its wide range as there is no information to suggest that this species has declined in this area.&#160;Fisheries in northern Australia are generally well managed and the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) have significantly reduced the bycatch of large stingrays. There are also significant marine protected areas in this species' range. This large species may have limiting life history characteristics that would make it biologically susceptible to depletion in fisheries and therefore, efforts should be made to assess and monitor mortality in fisheries and population trends throughout its range. The Mangrove Whipray is assessed as Vulnerable globally based on inferred levels of decline and exploitation across a large part of its range, but is considered to be Least Concern in Australia.","The Mangrove Whipray appears to prefer shallow inshore waters, including mangroves, estuaries, sand flats, and broken rocky-sandy substrate, although adults may move offshore and it has been recorded to a depth of at least 85 m (White <em>et al</em>. 2006; B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto and W. White, pers. obs. 2007). This species also appears to be solitary rather than forming aggregations, like some other stingrays (B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto, pers. obs. 2007). Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species reaches a maximum reported size of 141 cm disc width (DW),&#160; &gt;275 cm total length (TL) (White and Dharmadi 2007, W. White, pers. obs. 2007) and size at birth is reported at 14-28 cm DW (Manjaji 2004, White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Manjaji (2004) reports that males mature at 55-65 cm DW, but the biology and life-history characteristics of this species are generally poorly known. A generation length of 20 years can be estimated based on the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011), but noting that the Blackspotted Whipray grows to a much smaller maximum size (80 cm disc width) than the Mangrove Whipray (141 cm DW).<br/><br/>Davy <em>et al</em>. (2015) examined the movement patterns of juveniles (29.5-44.0 cm DW) at Orpheus Island, Australia between March and December 2012, with the majority of individuals showing high site fidelity, and were found to seek refuge within mangrove roots; presumed to be to reduce predation risk. The preference for nearshore habitats may increase its susceptibility to habitat loss (mangroves) and fisheries interactions (Davy et al. 2015).","The Mangrove Whipray is a rare species that is caught infrequently by tangle net, bottom trawl, and, to a lesser extent, longline fisheries in Indonesia (White <em>et al.</em> 2006; W. White, pers. obs. 2007) and in other parts of its range (Moore 2012). In these areas, most bycatch by commercial fisheries (especially trawlers) are landed and sold as food fish. The Mangrove Whipray and other stingrays are an important retained bycatch of the commercial gillnet fishery in Indonesia that targets rhynchobatid rays in the Arafura Sea (Last and Compagno 1999; W. White, pers. obs. 2007). Catches in inshore waters have declined and these vessels are having to travel farther to sustain catches; the rhynchobatid fisheries are very intensive in this region, thus the level of exploitation is extremely high. There is also evidence that fisherman in these regions increasingly illegally fish in Australian waters (Chen 1996; W. White, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>This species' preference for shallow inshore waters makes it particularly sensitive to extensive and intensive artisanal and industrial fisheries operating throughout large areas of its range, as well as habitat destruction and pollution (B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto and W. White, pers. obs, Vidthayanon 1997, Davy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Juveniles and sub-adults are targeted in mangrove areas and destruction of mangrove forests are having a significant effect on this species (W. White, pers. obs. 2007). Mangrove forests throughout Southeast Asia and large areas of the Eastern Indian Ocean have been deforested and degraded (FAO 2007). In this region, ~1.9 million hectares of mangroves have been logged during the last 25 years (FAO 2007). More than 90% of this loss has been caused by destruction of mangrove area in Indonesia, Pakistan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and India (areas where this species occurs) through conversion of land for shrimp farms, excessive logging, conversion of land for agriculture or salt pans and degradation through oil spills and pollution (FAO 2007). Even in well-managed mangrove areas that are protected from destruction, for example, the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in Ranong, Thailand (designated in 1997), this species may still face threats from local fisheries on which the people living in the reserve primarily depend (FAO 2007).<br/><br/>The Sicklefin Lemon Shark (<em>Negaprion acutidens</em>) occurs at similar depths to this species' preferred bathymetric range; the Sicklefin Lemon Shark&#160;is rarely observed in recent times in Indonesia due to the very high level of exploitation of inshore waters and its slow growth rate (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The Mangrove Whipray is apparently uncommon compared to other large&#160;<em>Himantura</em>&#160;species in this region, making it particularly susceptible. Given that this&#160;is a large stingray, probably with 'slow' life-history characteristics also, by comparison it is inferred that this species has also declined significantly in these areas.&#160;Artisanal inshore fishing pressure is also very intensive off eastern India (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). Fisheries throughout India operate on an open access basis and inshore marine species are thought to be fully or overexploited, with extensive use of illegal mesh sizes reported, and increasing bottom trawl effort (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). Demersal species, such as this, suffer more fishing mortality than pelagic species on the eastern coast of India (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). India's inshore fisheries are generally characterised by declining catch rates, declining recruitment and biomass, and a shift from regular landing patterns (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). Although no species-specific data are available on catches, it is inferred that this species has also suffered declines as a result of high levels of inshore exploitation in these areas also.<br/><br/>In Australia, catch data for this species are relatively limited, though large specimens were previously reported as bycatch in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery. However, with the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in the fishery, the ray bycatch has declined by 36.6% and there is likely to have been significant reductions in the catch and associated mortality of the Mangrove Whipray&#160;(Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>No data or information is available on catches in the Pacific Islands, but this species may be taken as bycatch in inshore subsistence and artisanal fisheries there also.","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>2009).&#160;Batoids are heavily exploited (White and Dharmadi 2007) and datasets from as early as 1963–1972 show the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979).<span lang=""EN-AU""> Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White, unpubl. data). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Mangrove Whipray&#160;in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are another key threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al.</em> 2010).</span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Mangrove Whipray is likely widespread in the Indo-West Pacific, around the Red Sea, Maldives, New Guinea, Micronesia, Gulf of Thailand, the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and off the Andaman, Santa Cruz, and Solomon Islands (Last and Stevens 2009). In Australia, it is reported inshore from Western Australia (Ningaloo Reef) to Queensland (Whitsunday Passage) (Last and Stevens 2009). There have been records from southern Queensland, but these are likely erroneous (Last and Stevens 2009). Records from the western Indian Ocean are documented by Moore (2012) and include a specimen from a fish market in Bir Ali, Gulf of Aden, Yemen in July 2009, as well as a further specimen captured on video being landed in the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) near Aqaba, Jordan in April 2010.</p><p><br/><br/></p>","The flesh is utilised fresh or salted and dried for human consumption (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Moore 2012), and the skin is used for leather (high value) (White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).",Marine,"The conservation measures in place for the Mangrove Whipray include both protected areas and gear modifications for fisheries.

The presence of marine protected areas within Australian coastal waters, such as Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP)&#160;and Shark Bay Marine Reserve, has reduced the potential for this species to be captured.

Since that time the condition of Lake Titicaca has worsened and population declines in this species are not only suspected to have taken place, but are ongoing and expected to continue into the future due to over-exploitation, habitat degradation resulting from water extraction and sedimentation, and domestic, industrial and agricultural water pollution, predation by introduced species,&#160;and the potential effects of chytrid fungus. In some areas of the lake, mainly in the Lago Menor of the Bolivian side, more than 90% of the population has disappeared. Using the time frame of the previous assessment starting in 1994, we estimate that over three generation lengths (42 years; 1994–2036) the population will undergo a decline of at least 50%. The generation length has been revised since the 2004 assessment from five years to 14 years based on an improved understanding of the species’ biology; however, due to the nature and severity of the threats that this species faces and observed ongoing population declines, it is believed that this is a defensible and reasonable estimate.<br/><br/><strong>Reason for the change in status:</strong><br/>In 2004, this species was assessed as Critically Endangered based on an estimate of an 80% population decline in the previous ten years (1994–2004). The generation length has been revised since the 2004 assessment from five years to 14 years based on an improved understanding of the species’ biology.<br/><br/>It is evident that the population is declining at an accelerated rate, thereby triggering a threatened category under criterion A. However, a lack of systematic surveys across the lake makes it difficult to accurately assess population sizes and rate of decline. Many different population estimates exist, but different methods were used and surveys were performed at different times of the year. With the initial population size estimates being very high (50–75 million individuals), a decline of 30–50% in such an abundant species over three generation lengths (42 years) would probably go unnoticed and therefore would probably represent an underestimate. On the other hand,&#160;80% decline is likely too high an estimate, as it would be difficult to justify the large numbers of individuals still extant in the lake. Considering the disparate population information and all of the threats to the species, it is thought that the population is very likely to experience a decline of at least 50% (but probably less than 80%) over three generations. Due to the uncertainty in the data, this reassessment takes a precautionary approach in the Endangered A4acde listing; it is believed that this is a defensible and reasonable estimate.</p>","It is an entirely aquatic species. Adults appear to prefer muddy or sandy areas with rocks and vegetation, while juveniles exhibit a strong preference for rocky habitats (Genova 2011). Its diet is diverse, but primarily consists of gastropods and crustaceans (Pérez 1998). Reproduction occurs in shallow waters close to Lake Titicaca's shoreline,&#160;in submerged aquatic vegetation (<em>Elodea sp.</em>), at depths between 2–15 m (Genova 2011, Flores 2013). In a year-long analysis by Pérez (1998), it has been determined that the species is able to reproduce all year, although they have been seen in amplexus only in winter months (May–November).&#160;There is variation throughout the year in the number of eggs per clutch: 115 eggs were recorded during the month of May, 777–866 eggs during October and 941 eggs during February (Pérez 1998).&#160;More recent data recorded between 200 and 500 eggs in the wild (A. Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016). In captivity, clutch size varies from 23–450 eggs in Peru (Pérez Bejar 2002, 2005; L. Bermudez pers. comm.) to 173–475 eggs in Bolivia (A. Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016).&#160;Eggs are placed in groups of 20–50 eggs on aquatic plants in different areas. Metamorphosis takes about four months (Pérez Bejar 2005).&#160;The generation length is estimated to be 14 years (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019).","Major threats include unregulated over-harvesting of adults (Lehr 2000, Angulo 2008a, Herzog 2009, Rodrigues 2013, Zevallos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016,&#160;SERFOR 2018a,b), water extraction and sedimentation, and domestic, industrial and agricultural water pollution (Pérez 2009, Monroy <em>et al</em>. 2014, Beltrán Farfán <em>et al.</em> 2015, MMAyA 2015). The pollution problem is exacerbated in the area of five municipalities in the basin in Bolivia: El Alto, Viachan, Laja, Pucarani and Puerto Perez, whose populations discharge their effluents and waste in Lago Menor across the&#160;Cohana&#160;Bay. The provinces of Carabaya, Melgar, Azángaro, Putina and Huancané on the Peruvian side do not have efficient treatment of wastewater, which enters directly into rivers. In addition, livestock is prominent throughout the region, including the buffer zone of the Titicaca National Reserve.&#160;The sediments of Lago Menor have levels of contamination beyond the limits for chromium, copper, iron, lead, zinc and arsenic (MMAyA 2015). Additionally, in the headwaters of the Río Ramis, Río Coata and Río Illpa in the Department of Puno, Peru, mining is occurring in the Cordillera Carabaya.&#160;In general, there has been a severe loss of suitable aquatic habitat, especially in areas where reproduction occurs. There have been massive die-offs in parts of its range in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016 (A. Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016; SERFOR 2016).&#160;In April 2015, a significant die-off event occurred in an area greater than 500 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at Lago Menor on the Bolivian side, primarily caused by the combination of an algae bloom and the release of hydrogen sulfide from the bottom of the lake which completely cut off oxygen to the frogs&#160;(Pérez 2015, A. Muñoz pers. comm. February 2016). In October 2016, an estimated 10,000 individuals were found dead on the Peruvian side of the lake, concentrated along a&#160;50 km stretch of the Coata River,&#160;with increased sewage runoff as the most likely culprit (SERFOR 2016).<br/><br/>Burrowes and De la Riva (2017) document the presence of&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;(<em>Bd</em>) in the species as early as 1863 (the oldest record of <em>Bd</em> hitherto in the world). Individuals&#160;from wild subpopulations of both countries, as well as captive specimens from markets in Cusco and Lima, have been found to be infected with the chytrid fungus,&#160;<em>B. dendrobatidis </em>(Berenguel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Berenguel <em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Zevallos <em>et al. </em>2016, Lay 2017, SERFOR 2019) and ranavirus (A. Muñoz pers. comm. 2015). It is possible that the chytrid fungus is being spread through illegal trade (Catenazzi <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Zevallos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Because this frog performs all gas exchange through its skin, <em>Bd</em> is particularly detrimental to its health (Berenguel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The presence of <em>Saprolegnia</em> fungi and co-infection with ranavirus is also a potential threat (Martin-Torrijos <em>et al</em>. 2016, Warne <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>In Peru, there are many legitimate trout concessions in Lake Titicaca geared primarily for external consumption (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. January 2011), in addition to informal aquaculture activities. There is evidence of predation of amphibian larvae by introduced species in Lake Titicaca, including Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and Pejerrey (<em>Odontesthes bonariensis</em>), in addition to competition between these species for space and food (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2010, E. Richard pers. obs. 2010, Martin-Torrijos <em>et al</em>. 2016). The high numbers of aquaculture sites give reason to suspect that high concentrations of trout may also bring in some of their associated risks. Additional threats include contamination of the lake from motorboat fuel, temperature increase from climate change and bycatch from fisheries (SERNANP 2015).&#160;The negative effects of climate change include increasing evaporation and temperature (which could make <em>Bd </em>more virulent; Muñoz<em> et al.</em> 2018), decreasing discharge of streams and glaciers into lakes, as well as, potential loss of breeding habitat (Bolivian Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).<p></p>","It was previously common, but has experienced massive population declines and is now threatened. In 1994, it was estimated that there were about 75 million individuals in Lake Titicaca (Morawetz 1994 in Pacheco 1997). In February 2001 (wet season), visual counting along 53 transects at eight locations of the Peruvian side of the lake revealed an estimate of 26.5 million individuals in the Peruvian side of the lake and 51 million individuals for the entire lake (BTA-Peru 2002b). A similar survey performed at 16 locations during July–August 2001 (dry season) estimated the population size to be nine million individuals in the Peruvian side of the lake and 17 million individuals for the entire lake (BTA-Peru 2002b).&#160;In Bolivia, the relative abundance of this species in Lago Menor, based on the average number of frogs found at different depths (1–10 m) by divers, has been estimated at 80 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Pérez Bejar 2002).&#160;<br/><br/>While many earlier population estimates assumed that the frogs were evenly distributed throughout the lake, more recent estimates are unable to extrapolate densities around the lake with any level of confidence. Given that the&#160;lake is so large and has different types of habitats, it is difficult to obtain a reliable census.&#160;Based on interviews in 2009, 68% of respondents indicated that it is more difficult to find large frogs now than it was previously, an indication that the proportion of individuals that successfully reach adulthood is low, and survival success also appears to be lower (Cortez <em>et al</em>. 2009). Information provided by local fishermen suggests that wild populations have declined (Pérez Bejar 2002, 2005).&#160;In 2011, distance sampling surveys at six localities in the north-west portion of Copacabana Peninsula estimated 575,000 adult individuals/km<sup>2</sup> and 1,630,000 juveniles/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Genova 2011).&#160;During 2009–2016, population monitoring suggests there have been local population declines in both Lago Mayor (Isla de la Luna) and Lago Menor (Guaqui) (A. Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016). During surveys on the Bolivian side of the lake, about 3% of the population was found dead (A . Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016). There have been mass mortality events in the Lago Menor area in 2009, 2011 and 2015. One month after the April 2015 mortality event, surveys of Lago Menor revealed 106 dead individuals in less than five minutes (A. Munoz pers. comm. 2015). October 2015 surveys between Puerto Pérez and the Island of Suriqui revealed no living individuals, despite frogs being present in the area prior to the event.&#160;In an area of about 300 km<sup>2</sup> in Lago Menor, where previously the species was relatively common, 100% of frogs were dead; however, in a small area of Lago Menor, adult frogs and breeding activity, can still be observed (Muñoz and Johnson 2017).&#160;There are other areas where adult frogs are absent and it appears that only juveniles or young adults are present (Muñoz and Johnson 2017). Another mass mortality event occurred in October 2016, this time on the Peruvian side of the lake, where an estimated 10,000 individuals were found dead (SERFOR 2016).&#160;The population structure is typically made up of 60% subadults and small adult frogs, 30% metamorphs and juveniles, and 5% big adults, however, this depends on the area (A. Munoz pers. comm.&#160;February 2016).<br/><br/>It is thought that the population will have declined by more than 50% over three generation lengths (42 years; 1994–2036)&#160;due to the synergistic effects of habitat loss and degradation, over-harvesting, climate change, and&#160;chytridiomycosis (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Lake Titicaca on the border of Peru and Bolivia. It has also been found in the neighbouring Lago&#160;Saracocha,&#160;Lago&#160;Umayo, Lago Chajchora, Laguna Arapa, Río Ilave, and&#160;Laguna de Alonso (E. Ramos pers. comm. 2018). It occurs at an elevation of 3,810 m asl, and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 18,563 km<sup>2</sup>, which represents a single threat-defined location.","This species is captured for food and for use in medicinal products. The medicinal use includes use as an aphrodisiac and to treat various ailments, such as memory loss, impotence and asthma, in Peru and Bolivia. It is traded whole and fresh, desiccated (Lehr 2000, Angulo 2008a, Herzog 2009,&#160;Zevallos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), as leather, as a juice or as flour (Lehr 2005, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2011). According to SERFOR of Puno, the new form of trafficking is the sale of dry frogs, which are more difficult to detect in their inspections. The consumption of the frog occurs in various forms; in Lima the frogs are prepared and consumed in the frog ""shake"" (Lehr 2000), while in Cusco frogs are consumed mainly in soup form (Angulo 2008a). The hips and legs of the frog are offered to tourists, mostly foreigners, as an ""exotic"", local dish in restaurants throughout parts of San Pedro de Tiquina, Huatajata, Copacabana, and La Paz, Bolivia (C. Cortez pers. comm, A. Muñoz pers. comm. February 2016, R. Elias pers. comm. 2018). A 2002 report focused on increasing the local demand of Titicaca Water Frog meat in restaurants and tourism areas, as well as on developing new marketing strategies to promote the high-protein product, including canning of frog legs in tomato sauce and a proposed slogan: ""Si visita Puno y el lago Titicaca, consuma la Rana Gigante del Lago"" (BTA-Peru 2002c). In 2006, an analysis of 28 communities surrounding Lake Titicaca determined a total of 27,548 frogs are consumed each year (Alvarez 2006). According to Rodríguez (2013), an average of 3,354 frogs are extracted each month (40,248 frogs/year) for human consumption, as meat and traditional medicine, in Bolivia. It has been estimated that over 15,000 individuals/year are used in the preparation of frogs legs (Pérez 2009). In 2013, the Bolivian newspaper, <em>Opinión</em>, reported that frog juice is being marketed in the city of El Alto. There is a potential public health risk from exposure to&#160;<em>Salmonella</em> through the consumption or handling of this species; approximately 7% (n=30) of specimens tested positive for&#160;<em>Salmonella </em>(Villena and Enciso 2008).&#160;Stevey Edery (2015) from Cayetano Heredia University isolated three species of&#160;<em>Vibrio&#160;</em>(<em>V. cholerae, V. alginolyticus and V. fluvialis</em>) in the&#160;confiscated&#160;skins of this species in&#160;Lima, Peru.<br/><br/>In recent years, a higher demand for this frog in major cities is placing even greater pressure on the population. Trade has been reported from El Alto, Bolivia (C. Cortez pers. comm), as well as from market stands in Cusco and Lima, Peru (Angulo 2008a, Zevallos <em>et al.</em> 2016). In April 2005, a cargo of about 4,400 individuals destined for human consumption was confiscated from illegal traders at a large market in Lima (INRENA 2005, Lundberg 2006). Interviews with merchants in Bolivia revealed that approximately 3,500 individuals of this species are collected each month to sell in markets (Palacios 2013). While most commercial sale is for domestic consumption in Peru and Bolivia, there is evidence of international trade within Latin America (Reading&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Several cases of illegal hunting for export, mainly to markets in the US, Canada, Europe, Brazil and Japan, have been reported (Rodríguez&#160;2013). In 2008, there were reports of this species in the pet trade in Europe and in March 2016, six individuals were seized, four of which were going to Europe for the pet trade (A. Muñoz pers. comm. February 2016). According to Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (SERFOR), between the years 2012–2015, more than 9,500 individuals have been seized in the regions of Puno, Arequipa and Lima (SERFOR unpubl. data). Considering the fact that this species is widely consumed in markets across the Andes and in Lima and that synergistic effects with other threats and declines are a real concern, it is possible that trade could have a significant impact on the global population of this species. In 2018, more than 500&#160;Titicaca Water Frogs were confiscated in two separate seizures in Puno; the frogs were being sold in markets in the city of Juliaca (SERFOR 2018a,b). In June 2019, more than 2,500&#160;Titicaca Water Frogs were confiscated by Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (SERFOR), the National Police of Peru and Customs at the Pucusana checkpoint&#160;during a routine inspection of a bus heading to Lima. These frogs were illegally extracted from Puno and it is presumed that they would be distributed in Lima markets to be used in the preparation of frog extracts. Specimens tested positive for the chytrid fungus (SERFOR 2019).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions In-Place<br/></em></strong><em style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/>In situ</em><strong>&#160;actions<br/></strong>It is present in the Titicaca National Reserve (TNR), but it is insufficient for effective conservation. In the TNR, there are several environmental problems: a) poor solid waste disposal near Uros Chulluini, Carata, Kapy-Uros; b) dumping of sewage into the mouth of Río Coata; c) presence of cattle without authorization; and d) informal fishing in a stretch of the Río Huile (SERNANP 2012).<br/><br/>In 2007, Denver Zoo launched a project in coordination with the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) to conserve the Titicaca Water Frog, which involves screening frogs for chytrid fungus and other diseases, genetic testing, assisting in surveys of the lake and markets, and an education campaign to change local attitudes and behaviours impacting the survival of this frog (Reading&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2011). In 2010, the first workshop was organized to develop the ""National Plan of Conservation Frog Titicaca in Peru"". Since 2012, Denver Zoo and the National Reserve of Titicaca signed a letter of understanding regarding the mutual interest of both institutions to develop research projects, monitoring and environmental education. In 2015, Denver Zoo and the Regional Government of Puno in Peru signed a memorandum of understanding to work together to monitor the Peruvian population of the species. Since 2016, Denver Zoo, along with Reserva Nacional del Titicaca, Gobierno Regional de Puno and the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, is collaborating with the Technical Forest and Wildlife Management of Puno and the Municipality of Lima in a campaign to promote awareness about the illegal use of this species in medicinal extracts (Elias&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2017).<br/><br/>In 2015, a monitoring programme was established in different sites of Lake Titicaca that are monitored regularly (A. Muñoz pers. comm. 2019). In February 2016, a pilot project for the&#160;<em>ex situ</em>&#160;conservation of the species transferred 70 individuals from Lago Menor (Guaqui) and Lago Mayor (Isla de la Luna) to the facilities, and included research on the species' natural history, population status and effects of&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>.<br/><br/><em><strong>Ex situ</strong></em><strong>&#160;actions<br/></strong>While attempts at captive breeding were initially unsuccessful (Pérez Bajar 2005), efforts led by Denver Zoo, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH; Peru) and the Huachipa Zoological Park (HZP; Peru), have successfully produced captive-born individuals to be used primarily for awareness raising purposes. In addition, the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide D’Orbigny (Bolivia) have produced captive-born individuals, which are being held for conservation and reintroduction purposes (A. Muñoz pers. comm. February 2016). Captive breeding began in 2008 at the Laboratory of Wildlife UPCH from seized individuals; with the help of HZP in Lima, the first pair managed to successfully reproduce in 2010. In November 2015, Denver Zoo received 20 Lake Titicaca frogs from the HZP with the aim to study their behaviour and increase their numbers.<br/><br/><strong>Policy-based actions<br/></strong>In 2012, the government of Puno issued an ordinance declaring this species a tourist attraction in the Lake Titicaca region. Since 2016, priority has been given to actions aimed at promoting the conservation of the Titicaca Water Frog by the Peru-Bolivia Binational Ministerial Cabinets. Under this binational effort, the “Binational Action Plan for the Conservation of the Titicaca Water Frog (<em>Telmatobius culeus</em>) and the Titicaca Grebe (<em>Rollandia microptera</em>)” was jointly approved in 2018 [see Gabinete Binacional de Ministros Perú-Bolivia 2018, CITES 2019b]. The Plan provides for the development of priority actions to improve the conservation status of this species, including reducing illegal trafficking and controlling threats to the population, and promoting sustainable activities for local communities. In April 2019, the Peruvian government launched an initiative to construct 10 new wastewater treatment plants, which will replace a 40 year-old existing treatment plant. In a bilateral meeting in June 2019, the construction of another twelve wastewater treatment plants was confirmed on the Bolivian side of the lake, in addition to the two monitoring stations already installed (Chisleanschi 2019).<br/><br/>The species is listed as Critically Endangered (CR) in Peru and has legal protection provided by the Categorization in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna (Decreto Supremo Nº004-2014-MINAGRI), which bans all hunting, capture, possession, transport or export of the species for commercial purposes. Peru is in the process of approving the ""National Strategy Against Illegal Wildlife Trafficking in Peru"", which includes activities related to the trade of the Lake Titicaca Frog. It is also listed as Critically Endangered in Bolivia’s Red Book of Threatened Vertebrates (Aguayo 2009), included in Bolivia’s action plan for threatened amphibians (MMAyA 2012) and the Amphibian Need Assessment organized by Amphibian Ark. Additionally, it is protected under Bolivian Law 1333 which prohibits the use of wildlife, and the Action Plan for the Conservation of Threatened Amphibians of Bolivia (2013–2017). The species was included in CITES Appendix I at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (CoP17) held in September 2016.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><em>Conservation Needed</em></span><br/>Measures are needed to maintain and protect key breeding sites (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).&#160;Wastewater treatment plants are needed on both sides of the lake to mitigate negative impacts of sewage runoff on this frog.&#160;The enforcement of legislation is needed to address over-harvesting problems in this species. Both national and international mechanisms and the&#160;enactment of legislation that strictly prohibits the movement, possession and use of this species, or any of its products, parts or derivatives is imperative. It is crucial to undertake baseline and complementary studies to determine the impact of harvests on the population (Angulo 2008a) and constant monitoring of the species and its habitat is necessary. Establishment of protected areas and the enlargement of already established protected areas is essential for the conservation of this species (Genova 2011).<br/><br/><strong><em>Research Needed</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong>More information is needed about this species' life history, population status, commercialization, and threats. Further studies should monitor trends in harvest levels. Given that <em>Bd</em> has been detected in this species, it should be monitored closely and studies assessing this species' tolerance and/or resistance to <em>Bd</em>&#160;are also warranted (Cossel <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is necessary to continue epidemiological studies regarding the potential public health risk this frog poses to its handlers and consumers, which might be used to discourage the utilization of the species. At the 18th&#160;meeting&#160;of the&#160;Conference of the Parties&#160;to&#160;CITES&#160;(CoP18) held in August 2019, a series of concrete actions were documented, urging Peru and Bolivia to collaborate in completing population studies of the species in Lake Titicaca&#160;and&#160;identifying and monitoring all international illegal trade of specimens&#160;(CITES 2019).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Counts over recent years indicate some fluctuations in numbers and recruitment but no overall decline and thus assumes stability, albeit there is a high level of uncertainty. The population is therefore thought to be undergoing a slower, suspected decline precautionarily. Potential new threats due to invasive species and fishing activities may however cause further, more significant reductions. If the population continues to show that it is remaining stable or increasing however, the species may warrant further change in status in the future.<p></p>","Lake Junín is fairly shallow and bordered by extensive reed marshes at 4,088 m. The grebe forages in open water, near the margins of the reed marshes in the (wet) breeding season (November-March), and in the centre of the lake in the dry austral winter. Spatial distributions have shown that the species concentrates mainly in the centre and further north of the lake, usually occurring in groups of over 50 individuals (Chamorro <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is likely that the species therefore only occupies around 50% of the lake due to preference and habitat quality (A. Chamorro <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It feeds mainly on small <em>Orestias</em> fish (which become scarce when the reedbeds dry out <strong></strong>[<strong></strong>O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997]), and invertebrate larvae and adults. Nests are built in flooded reedbeds; clutch size is two eggs<strong> </strong>(O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). It is probably long-lived, and invests little in recruitment per season<strong> </strong>(O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997), and breeding may fail completely in certain years (J. Fjeldså <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Adults will usually use the deepest parts of the lake for courtship, whilst areas with high densities of vegetation (such as Southern Bulrush [<em>Schoenoplectus californicus</em>] and Baltic Rush [<em>Juncus balticus</em>]) for nesting and rearing (Chamorro and Aucca 2019).&#160;<p></p>","Declines followed a deterioration in water quality owing to mining activities, and extreme water-level fluctuations (Valqui 1994). Water-level regulation for a hydroelectric plant supplying nearby mines causes nesting and foraging areas to dry out, and breeding to fail. Mining activities also pollute the lake, with the north-western part rendered lifeless by iron-oxide sedimentation<strong> </strong>(O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997, ECOAN 2009)<strong></strong>. Sewage from nearby towns also considerably increased when the Upamayo dam was built, as well as increasing the susceptibility to droughts and floods downstream (Chamorro and Aucca 2019). The lake is also polluted by sewage from nearby towns, which causes eutrophication and oxygen depletion and may lead to a reduction in the amount of fish available for the grebe to feed on (Dinesen <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). Burning of nearby bulrush grass may cause destruction of nests and breeding habitat (Chamorro and Aucca 2019). Relatively unstable climatic conditions, linked to El Niño Southern Oscillation events, may have contributed to large population fluctuations, with a recovery in years with high water levels (e.g. 1997-1998)<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>(T. Valqui <em>in litt.</em> 1999), and previous poor breeding successes. Although the population has shown major fluctuations, its ability to recover were it to experience a series of poor years is in doubt. Many individuals died during extreme cold conditions in 1982; similar conditions in June 2007 gave cause for concern (G. Engblom <em>in litt</em>. 2007). Non-native species such as Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) may also compete for nesting sites and food with juveniles further threatening the species's population (Chamorro and Aucca 2019, A. Chamorro <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Nets used by fisherman in order to catch invasive trout have also lead to the death of some individuals creating a new threat towards the species (A. Chamorro <em>in litt</em>. 2019, G. Engblom <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Hunting has been prohibited and is thought to no longer be a major problem (Chamorro and Aucca 2019).<p></p>","Different survey methods and identification challenges (such as similarities between Junin and Silvery Grebes; G. Engblom <em>in litt</em>. 2020) have made population estimates difficult. However, surveys between 2007 and 2016 indicate a population of between 217 and 468 individuals (ECOAN 2009, Engblom 2016a, b, Chamorro and Aucca 2017, Chamorro and Aucca 2018, Chamorro <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dinesen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160; The latest censuses estimates the population at 373 individuals (Chamorro&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2018), with 294 and 359 individuals in 2018 and 2019 respectively (A. Chamorro&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019).&#160;Combined censuses from 2010 to 2018 indicated that the population thus generally fluctuated between 300-400 individuals (Chamorro and Aucca 2019). However, due to high levels of uncertainty, assuming that the population may well go below 300 individuals in certain years, tentatively using a population size of 217-468 individuals, the population is thought to number 145-312 mature individuals, placed in the band of 140-320 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Podiceps taczanowskii</em> is a flightless waterbird confined to Lake Junín in the highlands of Junín, west-central <strong>Peru</strong>. It is thought to use only less than 50% of the lake on account of preference and habitat quality (A. Chamorro <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It was extremely abundant in 1938 (Morrison 1939), and the population was probably well over 1,000 birds in 1961 (O’Donnel and Fjeldsa 1997), but had undergone a severe decline since then (Dinesen <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). In the early and mid-1980s there were c. 250 birds, but only 100 were counted in 1992, falling to around 50 in 1993 (Valqui 1994). New extrapolations in early 1995, using a different methodology, estimated 205 individuals<strong> </strong>(O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). In August 1998, over 250 <em>Podiceps</em> sp. were found in 4 km<sup>2</sup> of the lake (suggesting a total of 350-400 birds) and all those identified (over 20) were <em>P. taczanowskii</em><strong> </strong>(T. Valqui <em>in litt.</em> 1999). It has now however been considered that following a major decline, the population had remained stable from the 1970s, through to the 1990s at c. 250-300 individuals (Chamorro and Aucca 2019).&#160;Counts in 2001, 2002 and 2007 using standardised survey methods estimated the population at 304, 249 and 217 individuals respectively (ECOAN 2009). Censuses in August 2014 and 2015 counted 315 and 238 birds, respectively (A. Chamorro and R. Tito <em>per </em>Engblom 2016a, A. Chamorro <em>per </em>Engblom 2016b). In 2016, the population size was estimated at 335-468 individuals (Chamorro and Aucca 2017, Dinesen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Following a period of drier climate, the latest censuses estimates the population at 373 individuals (Chamorro <em>et al</em>. 2018), with 294 and 359 individuals in 2018 and 2019 respectively (A. Chamorro <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Combined censuses from 2010 to 2018 shows that the population has generally fluctuated between 300-400 individuals (Chamorro and Aucca 2019).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong>Lake Junín has been declared a national reserve. It was also a designated Ramsar Site in 1996 and an Important Bird Area in 2008. Hunting and fishing are regulated but little was previously done to interfere with the management of the water level, which is controlled by hydro-energy companies that provide energy to the country; it is estimated that 20% of Peruvian energy is supply by dams on Lake Junín&#160;(O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997, A. Chamorro <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Hunting is now however considered to be prohibited, albeit may bilaterally be affected by hunting of other species within the area (Chamorro and Aucca 2019). An attempt was made to translocate grebes to a lake north of Junín; capture and transfer were feasible, but the chosen lake (and others) was unsuitable because gill-nets are used to fish rainbow trout<strong> </strong>(O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). Servicio Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (SERNANP, formerly INRENA: National Service of Natural Protected Areas) commissioned a species recovery plan in 2000 (Chamorro and Aucca 2019). In 2002, the Peruvian government passed an emergency law to protect the lake which makes provisions for its cleaning and places greater restrictions on the extraction of water (Valqui 1994). Areas of water are now 'cleaned' with less contaminated water (Chamorro and Aucca 2019). In 2009 the species was adopted as a symbol of wetland conservation in the high Andes by groups including BirdLife International, American Bird Conservancy, ECOAN and INRENA, who have called for an independent environmental audit and continuous environmental monitoring of the lake (BirdLife International 2009). In 2014, the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund implemented further conservation actions on Lake Junín&#160;(Chamorro and Aucca 2018). ECOAN has been undertaking conservation actions including a range of education and training activities with local communities and students, and research and monitoring of the species's population size and threats (ECOAN 2016, Chamorro and Aucca 2018, Chamorro and Aucca 2019). SERNAP, together with the Pedro Silvestre Atoc Family Group and the District Municipality of Carhuamayo have also endeavored to implement garbage collection in the northern sector of the lake (recovering 4 hectares of contaminated area) and providing fencing and natural trash bins to prevent further garbage disposal (Chamorro and Aucca 2018).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong>Monitor the population and reproductive success (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997,&#160;T.

Ensure continual of yearly surveys to overcome uncertainty in population trends (G. Engblom <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Protect clean watercourses flowing into Lake Junin and improve legislation and enforcement to prevent pollution (Dinesen <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). Identify and reduce sources of pollution in dialogue with local stakeholders (Dinesen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Reduce fluctuations in water-levels as a result of discharges from the hydropower dam<strong>&#160;</strong>(O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997, Dinesen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019) with the agreement and participation of the local mining company (Anon. 2007). Identify a lake for potential translocation of individuals<strong> </strong>(O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997) and consider establishing a viable captive-breeding population as captive-bred populations may not always succeed due to difficulty of rearing the species in captivity (J. Fjeldså&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Develop ecotourism in the area including building a lookout platform for the lake to aid population monitoring<strong> </strong>(Hirschfeld 2008). Implement regional tools to treat pollutants, and enforce laws for those who are responsible for their release (Chamorro and Aucca 2019).

It no longer qualifies as Vulnerable as there is no continuing decline. Recent increases in the population have been driven by a reduction in adult mortality through a combination of winter habitat protection and creation, and potentially also a temporary increase in the extent of suitable breeding habitat due to glacial melting. <br/><br/>The species remains Near Threatened as it is plausible that further changes in breeding habitat driven by climate change will reverse the positive recent impact and result in loss of wetlands. In addition there is concern that the impact of existing threats will grow, specifically from feral dogs and human disturbance at breeding sites, and power line collisions and accidental poisoning events during migration and the non-breeding season.<p></p> <p></p>","It breeds in alpine bog meadows and riverine marshes, favouring lacustrine marshes from 2,600-4,900 m. It prefers to nest at large water bodies, at a water depth of around 30 cm: this probably minimises exposure to nest predators. It winters in river valleys and along reservoir shorelines in the vicinity of barley and spring wheat fields. Whilst it prefers breeding in lakes, shallow marshes and meadows are the most important habitat for feeding; its diet consists of roots, tubers, insects, snails, shrimps, fish, frogs, small birds and rodents (Wu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009; Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010a, 2014).<br/><p></p>","Threats to the species are primarily connected with the availability of sufficient undisturbed habitat with suitable water levels. There is evidence that Black-necked Cranes are becoming concentrated at fewer sites in wintering locations, with some previously used areas being converted to greenhouse agriculture or for industrial development (Jia <em>et al. </em>2019). The general increase in the human population in the vicinity of the wetlands the species uses results in higher water demands that can reduce the suitability of key sites, while some have been directly drained for development (Lhendup and Webb 2009). Consequently, development projects that affect the control of water levels must account for the potential impact on the species, which is highly sensitive to water levels due to the threat from mammalian predators. At Dashanbao National Nature Reserve, China, plans to designate the area as a National Park include the relocation of people away from the core zone, however the increasing population of Black-necked Crane demonstrate a clear affinity for human sites due to the provision of waste grain from farming activities (Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The relocation plan would lead to the abandonment of&#160;farmland, upon which the cranes depend (Kong&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011. Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Wu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This represents a potential significant reduction in the number of cranes that this key site can support over winter in the future, which may drive increased adult mortality in this section of the population. Currently, a payment for ecosystem services pilot appears to be contributing towards a steady increase in crane numbers here (Peng <em>et al. </em>2020). A switch to planting a greater proportion of winter wheat reduces the availability of grain on cultivated land, and Peng <em>et al. </em>(2020) also demonstrate that the species generally avoids ploughed fields.&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change appears to be having a positive effect on the species's habitat over recent years (Li 2019), but there is concern that future change will reverse any positive impacts due to drying of breeding sites within the high altitude breeding range of the species (J. Harris&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007, M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In some areas water levels may be rising as a result of glacial melt and increased rainfall, but a lot of shallow wetlands used by the cranes are thought to be disappearing due to permafrost degradation (Farrington 2009). For example, in Ladakh, India, Lake Tsomoriri showed a rise in water between 2000-2006 and then the water level started decreasing, whereas Tsokar Basin is shrinking (P. Chandan&#160;<em>pers comm. per&#160;</em>M. A. Bishop and F. Li.&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). These peripheral areas of the population may be the first to demontrate negative impacts and these populations should be carefully monitored.<br/><br/>A small number of birds have been killed after striking power-lines (Li 2002; Li&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012), and wind turbines could prove an additional threat (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;The threat from power-lines is suspected to be growing following the rapid expansion of local power grids in China: 9 out of 15 juvenile Black-necked Crane fitted with satellite tags were killed in Linzhou, Tibet between 2018-2020 (Y. Guo&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). The use of poisoned bait to control rodent pests in breeding areas poses the risk of unintentional posioning (Li 2019). Intensive grazing has caused degradation of grasslands in breeding grounds, with an increase in grazing in wetlands of particular concern (Li 2019). In Bhutan and India, feral dogs have been increasingly observed to take eggs and chicks, and even adults (I. Acharja <em>in litt. </em>2020, S. Dhumal <em>in litt. </em>2020, J. Eaton <em>in litt. </em>2020,&#160;&#160;L. Visuddha <em>in litt. </em>2020)<br/>There are additional threats from poorly-regulated tourism to wintering areas, which could cause significant disturbance to large numbers of birds and reduce habitat area and quality through the creation of additional infrastructure such as roads (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Fish-farming, peat and firewood collection, river channelisation, industrial pollution and sedimentation, and the construction of roads and fences have resulted in increased disturbance and habitat degradation in Qinghai, Sichuan, Ruoergai and Yunnan, China (Wu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, Qiang Liu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). Further disturbance at the species's stopover sites arises from the use of the areas as camping grounds by local herders (Qian&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).&#160;The collection of eggs and poaching have been problems in parts of China and India, although the extent of this is currently not thought to be significant.","The global population is estimated at c.10,000-10,200 individuals in total (Li <em>et al </em>2014), roughly equivalent to&#160;c.6,600-6,800 mature individuals. Recent counts suggest that numbers may be larger than this (Jia <em>et al. </em>2019) and if these counts genuinely reflect a larger total rather than redistribution then&#160;this figure may need to be further revised upwards.",Stable,"<em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Grus nigricollis</span> breeds on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span>, with a small population in adjacent Ladakh, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India (</span>Li 2019). The breeding area stretches through mostly continuous plateaus (Li 2019). Ruoergai marshes is thought to hold the largest breeding population, estimated at 2,500 mature individuals (Li 2009). 476 individuals (plus 38 chicks) were recorded in a breeding population survey in the Changtang region of Tibet in 2008 (Li 2019). Repeated surveys at Shenzha in the southern part of the Celin Cuo Black-necked Crane National Nature Reserve found 16 nests in 1991 and 30 nests in 2000. Where breeding sites have been revisited, the recent numbers of breeding pairs have been greater than past reports (Li 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Three isolated wintering populations<span lang=""EN-US""> have been identified at lower altitudes on the Qinghai-Tibet and Yunnan-Guizhou plateaus, China, and<strong> Bhutan</strong>.&#160;<br/>(1) The Eastern population, approximately 4,300 cranes, winters in northeastern Yunnan and northwestern Guizhou Provinces (Li <em>et al. </em>2014, Yang &amp; Zhang 2014). The majority winter in three national nature reserves on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in this flyway (Dashanbao, Cao Hai and Huize), where 2,469 Black-necked Cranes were counted in 2004 (Li and Yang 2005). Satellite tracking data of eight birds and two colour-banded cranes show birds from Dashanbao and Cao Hai migrate to Ruoergai for breeding (Qian <em>et al. </em>2009, Wu <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993). Small numbers were once recorded in Vietnam (Bishop &amp; Tsamchu&#160;2007), but this species has not been seen there for over than 30 years.&#160;<br/>(2) The Central population winters in northwestern Yunnan, 232-300 individuals (Li <em>et al. </em>2014, Yang and&#160;Zhang 2014,&#160;Q. Liu&#160;<em>pers. comm. per&#160;</em>M. A. Bishop and F. Li.<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Napahai Provincial NR has a stable population of 270 Black-necked Cranes, an increase from less than 100 in the 1980s and before 1997 (Zhao and&#160;Yu 2005, Wang <em>et al. </em>2009). Napahai is the winter home for &gt;90% of Black-necked Cranes in the central flyway.&#160;&#160;<br/>(3) The Western population, approximately 8,700 individuals (Jia <em>et al. </em>2019), winters in south-central Tibet and Bhutan with a very few regularly wintering in Arunachal Pradesh, India (Chandan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014)<span lang=""EN-US""><em>.<strong>&#160;</strong></em>Along the Lower and Middle Reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) River Basin in Tibet, a maximum of 8,291 individuals were present in January 2018 (Jia <em>et al. </em>2019), with the majority using the Middle Yarlung Tsangpo Black-necked Crane NNR. This is an increase on previous counts,&#160;5,559 in 2014 (Zhang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014), or 6,500 (Yang<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016;&#160;<em>fide&#160;</em>Jia&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;and 6,940 in 2007 (Bishop and Tsamchu 2007). <span lang=""EN-US"">Around 550&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Black-necked Cranes winter in Bhutan (Phuntsho and&#160;Tschering 2014,&#160;Royal Society of Protection of Nature [RSPN]&#160;2015)<span lang=""EN-US"">, in four wintering sites in Bhutan at Phobjikha, Bumdeling, Khotokha, and Bumthang.

It is legally protected in China, India and Bhutan; with&#160;WWF-India&#160;and the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature have&#160;been taking a leading role in coordinating conservation work for Black-necked Cranes&#160;in India and Bhutan,&#160;respectively (M. A. Bishop and F. Li <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;A Black-necked Crane Conservation Network was formed in China in 2006, and long-term cooperation exists between partners (such as Kunming Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Tibet Plateau Institute of Biology, the National Bird Banding Center of China and the International Crane Foundation)&#160;to help conserve this species (M. A. Bishop and F. Li <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;Major breeding and wintering areas are protected in China,&#160;covering a total of 89,073 km<sup>2 </sup>(M. A. Bishop and F. Li <em>in litt. </em>2016). There have been conservation and development programmes in local communities at the important sites of Cao Hai and Dashanbao. The Indian breeding population occurs in the Changthang Cold Desert Wildlife Sanctuary. Shooting of cranes and other wildlife in the region has been substantially reduced due to control of firearms, better enforcement of wildlife protection laws and greater awareness (J. Harris <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2007). There is an annual census of the wintering population in Bhutan, where there is also November festivals held to raise public awareness of the importance of crane conservation (Anon. 2010a, b), and annual winter counts at Dashanbao, Cao Hai and Napahai. Education programmes also exist at two key sites in China; Cao Hai and Ruoergai (M. A. Bishop and F. Li <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Winter ecology and migration studies have been conducted extensively in recent years. Winter cropping is banned in Bumdeling, Bhutan, to maintain a food supply for the cranes (Lhendup and Webb 2009).<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Co-ordinate work on this species throughout its range, including range wide counts, sharing of information on threats and conservation responses and increasing capacity for resource managers such as nature reserve staff (M. A. Bishop and F. Li <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Stop drainage of marshes and the use of pesticides and rodenticides. Maintain water-levels of wetlands at Cao Hai (China) and prohibit encroachment. Leave some harvested fields unploughed in the wintering grounds between November-March. At Ruoergai (China) control meadow livestock during key feeding periods (May to August) and establish protected buffer zones around breeding lakes and swamps (Wu<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al</span>. 2009). Restrict livestock at Napahai (China) and maintain a network of farmed areas as wetlands (Qiang Liu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Continue to investigate the species's migration and monitor birds along migration routes (Lhendup and Webb 2009). Include newly identified stopover sites, most of which are not already protected, in the nature reserve system, especially those threatened by disturbance from local herders (Qian <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Designate breeding areas in Ladakh (India) as waterbird sanctuaries.&#160;Ban settlement expansion in important areas of crane habitat in Bhutan. Careful planning on tourist/eco-tourist development in both wintering and breeding areas. Regulate tourist access to the species. Educate farmers and implement subsidies in important areas to promote management that suits the cranes, and reduce disturbance (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Additionally, implement education programmes for the general public, especially students, teachers and policy makers; and promote this species as a flagship for the preservation of high-altitude wetland ecosystems (M. A. Bishop and F. Li <em>in litt. </em>2016). Create a new action plan for the species (Lhendup and Webb 2009). Monitor the species and its habitat focusing on the impact from climatic and glacial changes on breeding habitats. Establish baseline information on chemical contaminants, including heavy metals and pesticides, to assess impact of these factors on cranes (M. A. Bishop and F. Li <em>in litt. </em>2016), and as the species may be become more isolated in the future, potentially conduct genetic studies, especially within and between wintering groups that are on separate wintering grounds (M. A. Bishop <em>in litt. </em>2016).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Whilst the situation is more concerning in Southeast Asia despite its marginal occurrence here, localised declines also continue to occur across India, of which currently holds the majority of the population. Comprehensive monitoring is however required to limit uncertainty in population trends.","It inhabits rivers and freshwater lakes, also occurring rarely on estuaries, and breeds on sandy and rocky islands, especially along river banks (Mundkur 1991, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species is known to be breed in high concentrations in large reservoirs and rivers, as well as natural and artificial wetlands in India (G. Sundar <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Some sandbanks may also be used for nesting due to temporary exposure after irrigation and water management from nearby reservoirs (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160; It has been recorded up to 600 m in Nepal. It feeds predominantly on fish, small crustaceans, insects, and frogs (Mundkur 1991). Breeding occurs mainly in February-May, although the season may extent from November to May (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Mundkur 1991).","Nesting areas are vulnerable to flooding, predation and disturbance (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160;In a 2017-2019 study in Odisha, India, flooding, predation and cyclones were the main threats (Debrata 2019, Kar <em>et al</em>. in prep). Local fishermen also report that children collect eggs and chicks from sandbanks, which may pose a substantial threat to ground-nesting birds. Strangling of chicks in discarded fish nets is being recorded at different areas and may pose a growing risk (Narwade and Fartade 2013, Reshamwala 2017). Sand and gold mining is an emerging threat for breeding colonies of Indian Skimmer, with which the River Tern nests and is thought to have a long-term effect on nesting-island formation (Das 2015, Shaikh <em>et al</em>. 2018, Debata <em>et al.</em> 2019, C.&#160;Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Poor water level management along rivers are additionally affecting the stability of colonies (T. Mundkur <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In several places in India, human disturbance, encroachment of wetlands by cities, disturbance by photographers and birdwatchers, egg and chick trampling by domestic water buffalo and Chital deer is common (Amoghavarsha 2013, S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Future plans for water transportation routes on the&#160;Ayeyawady, and dredging on the Chindwin River for commercial and passenger transport&#160;may further create localised threats (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Predation of eggs and chicks by a variety of terrestrial animals including domestic dogs, Lesser Bandicoot Rat (<em>Bandicota bengalensis</em>), Monitor Lizard (<em>Varanus salvator</em>; Mundkur 1991), and avian predators including House Crow (<em>Corvus splendens</em>; Siddiqui <em>et al</em>. 2007), Black-headed Ibis (<em>Threskiornis melanocephalus;&#160;</em>Parimala 2013, Reshamwala 2017), Pallas’s Fishing Eagle (<em>Haliaeetus leucophus</em>; Lowther 1949) and Bonelli's Eagle (<em>Aquila fasciata</em>; Belur 2014) may be taking their toll. Invasive plants such as <em>Mimosa pigra </em>may also reduce nest success and chick survival (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>The negative population trend in Laos is probably due mainly to excessive human disturbance on sandbars (Thewlis <em>et al</em>. 1998). In Nepal, it is&#160;threatened by food shortage, illegal and over-fishing in protected areas, destruction of breeding habitats on rivers, disturbance and hunting (K. Bhusal <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cambodia, a study of breeding colonies in 2010-2015 found that egg collection, predation by rodents, crows and domestic dogs and trampling by domestic water buffalo were responsible for low breeding success (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2017, J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2018).&#160;The study found very little evidence of direct hunting of the species, although a snare was once found at a nest (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160; The multitude of dam construction projects completed, underway or planned in South-East Asia (e.g. along the Mekong river [F. Goes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011]<em></em>) may also threaten the species through changes to flow regime and flooding of nest-sites. Dams along the Sesan river in Vietnam have precipitated the decline and led to near-extirpation of the species downstream in Cambodia (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Its habitat may be threatened by the construction of dams  in the Dayingjiang region of south-western Yunnan (Yang Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>.  2011, Dasgupta 2019). In Nepal it is severely threatened by food shortages owing to illegal fishing inside protected areas and overfishing outside protected areas, it is also threatened by destruction of breeding habitat, disturbance and hunting (Inskipp <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Myanmar, planned developments may potentially threaten the species in the future (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Breeding sites along the Indus River (passing between the plains of Punjab and Sindh provinces) are threatened with encroachment and conflict, as well as agricultural expansion leading to increases in human settlements and live stock (M. Ali <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","A previous Asian Waterbird Census' observed 5,733 birds during 1987-1992, 5,558 during 1993-1997, 9,963 during 1998-2002, and 7,578 during 2003-2007 across some Indian and Pakistan sites (Li <em>et al</em>. 2009). Further surveys for the 2008-2015 period then observed across all of Asia and Australasia found an overall 29,577 birds across Myanmar (39 birds), Thailand (2), Bangladesh (74), India (17,776), Nepal (31), Pakistan (11,485)&#160;and Cambodia (170) (Mundkur <em>et al</em>. 2017). Under-counting is however thought to have been a major factor. Populations in the Southeast Asian part of its range are however very small and at higher risk of extinction (F. Goes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In the whole Mekong basin for example, the population is currently estimated at less than 100 birds (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Using the best available information therefore, the population is thought to number at least 29,500 individuals, with the potential to reach a maximum of 100,000 individuals, assuming some surveys may be under-counted. Using a rounded population size of 30,000-100,000 individuals therefore, the population is placed in the band of 20,000-70,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species occurs along river systems across a wide range in southern and south-east Asia, being found in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pakistan</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bangladesh</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Myanmar</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Thailand</span>,&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cambodia</span>,&#160;and southern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span> (Yunnan), as well as <strong>Nepal, Bhutan, Laos, </strong>and <strong>Vietnam </strong>during the non-breeding season ([T.

Whilst the population in India, Bangladesh (albeit has become rare here), Pakistan, Myanmar and Cambodia are largely resident with some seasonal movement, the species will have additional local movement in India, often migrating to Nepal (considered rare) and Bhutan during the non-breeding season, with breeders from southwest China migrating to northern Laos (T. Mundkur <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>It has also reportedly declined in abundance in Thailand, where it is now considered very rare (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>.1996). The species has declined along the Mekong River, in Laos since the early 20th century (Thewlis <em>et al</em>. 1998), and was very close to being extirpated from the country (W. Duckworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). It has also been undergoing a strong decline along the Mekong River system in Cambodia since 2003, with extirpation or sharp declines noted in the number of pairs throughout its breeding range since 2007 (Goes 2014, F. Goes&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2016). Specific conservation actions, alongside nest protection and exclosure have however slowed down decline rates and stabilised the core Mekong population (Classern 2018, F. Goes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>It however no longer breeds on the Tonle Sap, the Mekong below Kratie, or Sesan River (Goes 2014, Claassen 2018). In Cambodia the species has declined by &gt;80% in the past 20 years and in 2018, the population was estimated to be 54-62 individuals whilst less than 50 birds are thought to exist currently (Claassen 2018, S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Moreover, only 2-3 pairs are thought to occur at Sekong River in Siem Pang (J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Two nests were observed in May 2019 at Khang Lok Krau, albeit only one was observed 3 days later due to rat predation&#160; (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2019). During the 2017-2019 period overall, further records showed only one pair that nested on a particular river stretch in Myanmar (with nesting deemed unsuccessful due to flooding in 2019), a decrease from 65-69 birds observed during the 2003-2004 period (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In China, the species occurs along two river systems, including the Dayingjiang River in Southwestern Yunnan and the Yarlung Zangbo River in Southeastern Tibet (W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is described as uncommon along the Dayingjiang river in south-western Yunnan (Yang Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, Dasgupta 2019). The number of species present on the Dayingjiang River had declined from 30 birds to less than 5-13 between 2010-2019, with only 5 individuals recorded in early 2020; 11 individuals are however currently thought to reside on this river temporarily after one pair successfully raised two clutches, harbouring 3 juveniles each (X. Zheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020, W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020), suggesting temporary recovery of the population here. 3 individuals have additionally been sighted on a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River in 2018. It may also occur in small numbers on the Ruili River, between the border of China and Myanmar (H. Fen-Qi <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Pakistan, the species is common throughout most small and large wetlands, subjected to only selective declines in particular sites (Z. Shaikh <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>The species has greatly declined to a few pairs that may breed at few sites on the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers in Myanmar (Zöckler 2020, A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020), with only one breeding site in Bangladesh (Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Recent sightings at Padma River in the Rajshahi Division are confirmed however, with 10-20 pairs observed continuously&#160;over the last decade on the Bangladeshi coast (S. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;</span>Only one pair was observed near Bhamo on the Ayeyarwady River between Myitkyina and Bagan during 2017-2019 (Zöckler&#160;2020). This is after 81 birds observed in the early 2000s. More than 40 birds were although recorded at Chindwin River in recent surveys (2018-2019; C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Nepal, the species is now a rare and very local visitor, with a maximum population of 20 individuals estimated in 2016, having rapidly declined since the 1990s (Inskipp&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is only regularly recorded from two protected areas here; Bardia National Park and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (K. Bhusal <em>in litt</em>. 2020, R. Chaudhary <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In contrast to declines noted in South-East Asia, the species is now more regular in southern India than was once thought, having probably benefited from the development of reservoirs (Praveen J.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012). At Pong Dam hydro-electric power station for example, 384 nests were observed in 2006 (with 126 nests observed on Ranseer Island), 400 nests in 2015, with an average sighting record of 800-1,000 birds every winter (S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;22 nests were recorded in 2016 at a sandbar near Mundali Dam, downstream of the Mahanadhi (Odisha state; S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Likewise, the species is described as having increased in Andhra Pradesh over the past 10 years (S. Riyazuddin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Encroachment of wetlands by cities and developments have however led to drastic declines in altered wetlands since the late 1990's (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). At Chilika Lake (Odisha state), despite previously harbouring c. 1,500 birds and particularly 300-400 birds on the Nalabana Island (located within the lake), the species has seen marginal declines here for example; 540 nests were found in 2002, with declines beginning in 2003, leading to only 200 nests in 2008, and subsequently below 50 nests in 2010, and complete abandonment of the island by 2011 (S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020). 20-30 nests have since been observed on a nearby, unprotected island (Panchgudhi; S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Declines (likely attributed to fishing camps) have also been observed in sandy islands and tracts in&#160;Brahmaputra, Subansiri, Lohit and Dibang (A.&#160;Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Alternatively, 11,000 nests were recently found at Almatti Backwaters in Bagalkot, Karnataka over 12 exposed sandy islands (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Despite some localised declines therefore, the species is overall considered to be widespread in large numbers across many artificial and natural wetlands in India (G. Sundar <em>in litt</em>. 2020).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Conservation Actions Underway</span><br/>The species is protected under Schedule-IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (State of India's Birds 2020). The species is considered At Risk in Laos, Critical in Thailand, Critical in Cambodia (Goes 2014) and Critically Endangered in Nepal (Inskipp <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species occurs in a number of protected areas. In Cambodia, nest protection programmes have been implemented by the World Wildlife Fund on the Mekong River and by the Royal University of Phnom Penh on the Sekong and Sesan rivers (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2016). These programmes involve education, employing local people as nest guards and the use of predator exclosures&#160;(A. Claassen&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Local conservation efforts is thought to enable temporary recover of the species on Dayingjiang Rive (W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Cambodia, a Species Action Plan has been prepared for 2018-2028 (Claassen 2018), however this currently lacks funding to be implemented properly (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Myanmar,&#160;a nest protection programme is being implemented on the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers by the Wildlife Conservation Society (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Community Conservation Areas (CCA's) are also proposed to maintain the last remaining sites along the Ayeyarwady River (Zöckler&#160;2019). In China (Yunnan), nest protection is being led by the Kandoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020, X. Zheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Direct payments have additionally proven successful in implementing nest protection, however require continued use of monitoring, community relations and exclosures (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Implementation plans are additionally in place in order to declare Almatti, India as a Conservation Reserve (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Conservation Actions Proposed</span><br/>Carry out regular surveys to monitor the population and seasonal movements throughout its range.

Conduct education activities to help alleviate human pressures on river and lake habitats. Lobby against high-risk dam projects, especially in South-East Asia. Maintaining sufficient water levels around breeding sites or restoring the flow regimes to prevent loss of nesting islands during the breeding season (as rivers in India are under tremendous pressure of water demand; hence all future water-supply projects are subjected to cumulative impact assessments, including their impact on River Tern and other riverine ground nesting waterbirds; T.

In small parts of the range, conservation action managed to halt poaching pressure and local populations show signs of recovery.","It inhabits semi-arid woodland and semi-deciduous forest, arid scrub and savannas, mangroves, clearings in deciduous forest, Pacific swamp-forest, evergreen gallery forest and sometimes secondary growth in agricultural landscapes (Juniper and Parr 1998, Taylor 2013, R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Work involving radio-tagged individuals has shown that the species may also make use of farming and ranching areas (Salinas-Melgoza <em>et al. </em>2013), and land management type can influence home range size and roosting behaviour (Salinas-Melgoza <em>et al. </em>2013). This may be a result of differences in resource availability (Salinas-Melgoza <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Yellow-naped Amazons have been reported to use traditional sites for roosting for decades (Wright 1996), though data from radio-tagged individuals indicate that traditional roosts may change location (A. Salinas-Melgoza and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016). Roost size can be up to several hundred individuals (Matzuak and Brightsmith 2007), though in some areas roost size has reduced significantly (M. Lezama <em>per </em>C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species may perform regional movements of up to 16 km (A. Salinas-Melgoza and T. Wright <em>in litt.</em> 2016); and&#160;genetic evaluations indicate there are high rates of gene flow through Costa Rica with ongoing dispersal, probably female-biased (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;The species's diet has been seldom studied,&#160;but so far it has been found to feed on 48 food plant species (Matuzak <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008,&#160;A. Salinas-Melgoza and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016).","The species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation, driven primarily by the expansion of agriculture, and capture for local and international trade (Juniper and Parr 1998; Anon. 2008). Deforestation has been a prevalent threat in all range states (Grijalva 2008). For example, mangrove forests in the Gulf of Fonseca region are being cleared for the development of aquaculture and extraction of firewood and timber (Grijalva 2008). In Honduras, the species has been recorded as being c.93% less common in modified habitats, such as cultivation, compared to broadleaved forest (Wiedenfeld 1993). The conversion of areas to sugar cane or rice production is also threatening its habitat, particularly in Nicaragua (C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Mexico, less than 30% of the original cover of primary habitat remains within the species's range (J. C. Cantú <em>in litt</em>. 2021).<br/>The species is considered one of the most sought-after psittacines in the Central American pet trade<em></em>, owing to its vocal capabilities (Wiedenfeld 1993; R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011; J. Gilardi <em>in litt</em>. 2011; C. Muccio <em>in litt</em>. 2021). During the 1990s, close to 100% of known nests in southern Guatemala were subject to poaching; since 2004, 74 individuals have been seized from illegal trade (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2011; C. Muccio <em>in litt</em>. 2021). In El Salvador, the species also suffers heavy nest-poaching (R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). At least 100 individuals are legally kept as pets in the country, while 57 individuals were confiscated from illegal trade between 2014 and 2019 (N. Herrera <em>in litt</em>. 2021). It has been reported that each year c.5,000 young <em>A. auropalliata</em> are smuggled out of the La Mosquitia region, Honduras (<em>per</em> O. Andino <em>in litt</em>. 2011), although this has not been verified. Such numbers would not be unrealistic given that on average, 8,388 birds were recorded in export from Honduras each year in the period 1987-1989 (Wiedenfeld 1993). Not only adults and chicks, but also eggs are sought after by traffickers (L. Joyner<em> in litt</em>. 2021). An increase in seizure levels in Mexico suggests that trapping pressure is currently increasing (J. C. Cantú <em>in litt</em>. 2021). The numbers recorded in export from Nicaragua appeared to be decreasing in the past (Lezama <em>et al</em>. 2004); however, nest poaching is still high (J. A. Díaz Luque <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011; M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2011), and thought to affect over 50% of nests in Rivas department (M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Recent market surveys however show that trade has been increasing again since 2016 in Managua, Rivas and further cities, despite being prohibited by law (M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Costa Rica roughly a third of nests were raided, accounting for c.85% of the all nest failures observed (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2001; Grijalva 2008), although in another study conducted near Liberia, up to 100% of the nests located by researchers had been poached (A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In southern Guatemala, almost only those nests which are inaccessible by poachers successfully fledge young (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2021). The nest failure rate was generally found to be very high in  Costa Rica (89%), with the majority of nest failures found to result  from poaching for the pet trade (64%) (Dahlin <em>et al</em>. 2018). Poaching of nestlings can also affect future breeding in the species, as damage of nest trees when extracting nestlings can make the tree no longer usable as a nest site (C. Dahlin<em>&#160;per </em>A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is thought that twice as many are taken from the wild than are recorded in export, based on a mortality rate of 54% during capture and transit (Pérez and Zúñiga 1998 in Grijalva 2008), although a survival rate of one in three or four has also been reported (<em>per</em> O. Andino <em>in litt</em>. 2011).<br/>Anthropogenic threats are thought to exacerbate the effects of poor rates of recruitment to the breeding population (Grijalva 2008). In parts of the range, the species suffers from cavity occupation by Africanised Bees (R.  Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Climate change may also have an impact on the species as there have been hotter and longer dry seasons in the region, though the impact of this on the species is essentially currently unknown (C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016).","Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population to number fewer than 50,000 mature individuals; however, recent evidence suggests that the population is considerably smaller than this. The species is known to be in rapid, ongoing decline. Current population estimates include 400-520 individuals in Guatemala (Muccio 2019; M. Dupin <em>in litt</em>. 2020; L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2021), up to 200 individuals in El Salvador (N. Herrera <em>in litt</em>. 2021) and a few hundred individuals in Honduras and Nicaragua, respectively (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2021). Census data for Costa Rica suggest a population of at least 1,195 individuals in 2021 (C. Sánchez <em>in litt</em>. 2021).<br/>Comprehensive surveys carried out in 2016 and 2018-2019 following a  standard protocol estimate a population of 2,361 individuals across the  range (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2019; Dupin <em>et al</em>. 2020). This roughly equates to 1,575 mature individuals. To account for uncertainty, the population is here placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.&#160;It is assumed that the species forms three subpopulations, equivalent to the three recognised subspecies <em>auropalliata</em>, ranging from Mexico to Costa Rica, <em>caribaea</em>, on the islands north of Honduras, and <em>parvipes</em>, in northeastern Honduras and northern Nicaragua (see del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Decreasing,"<em>Amazona auropalliata</em> is found in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mexico</span> and Central America, occurring along the Pacific slope of the isthmus in southern Mexico (Oaxaca and Chiapas), <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Guatemala</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">El Salvador</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nicaragua</span> and north-western <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Costa Rica</span>, the Bay Islands of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Honduras </span>(see also Gilardi 2014), and the Caribbean slope in eastern Honduras and north-eastern Nicaragua (Juniper and Parr 1998; Taylor 2013).

Muccio <em>in litt</em>. 2019; N. Herrera <em>in litt</em>. 2021; C. Sánchez <em>in litt</em>. 2021).",The species is considered one of the most sought-after psittacines in the Central American pet trade; it is trapped at extremely high levels throughout its range (Wiedenfeld 1993; R.

It roosts communally every night, preferably on mangrove islands (Berg and Angel 2006). Breeding has been noted in January-March (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Most of Ecuador's forests and mangroves have been cleared since the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, with aquaculture pond development for shrimp farming being the main driver of mangrove loss (B. Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The clearance and unsustainable use of mangroves may have slowed because of protection measures, but loud bird-scaring devices used at existing shrimp farms are likely to cause disturbance to the species (B. Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Overall, habitat loss and degradation driven by agricultural expansion, cutting of firewood and development are regarded as on-going threats to this species. Trapping pressure is another on-going threat; it is thought that a large proportion of the communities within the range keep the species as pets (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020). The population near Bahia de Caraquez has been severely reduced to the trapping (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","The roost near Bahia de Caraquez contains roughly 60-116 individuals, equating to 40-80 mature individuals (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020).

While the majority of birds trapped and sold in Java are Sangkar White-eye <em>Z. melanurus </em>(Lim <em>et al. </em>2019), the habitat and range restricted Javan White-eye has been targeted apparently because there is a demand for novelty, and all species seem to have sufficient value to be caught.&#160;42 Javan White-eyes were observed over a three day inventory of the main markets on Java in 2014 (Chng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), with 26 individuals recorded in five markets in June 2015 (Chng and Eaton 2016).

The species is therefore listed as Near Threatened.","It inhabits xerophytic vegetation, frequenting dry desert shrublands dominated by cacti and low thorn-bushes or trees (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020).

J. Sharpe&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, 2021; Rojas-Suárez and Rodríguez 2015). In Venezuela, this species is the 4<sup>th</sup> most traded parrot (Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2020). Individuals are widely exploited for trade, serving a strong internal pet market; many chicks taken in Bonaire are believed to end up in Curaçao (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2007; Martin 2009). Additionally, in some areas it is hunted for allegedly damaging crops (Rodríguez and Rojas-Suárez 1995; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; Briceño-Linares <em>et al</em>. 2011; Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Negative attitudes due to its perception as a crop pest in agricultural  and urban areas of Bonaire may encourage persecution and undermine  support for conservation efforts (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2012).<br/>Habitat loss and degradation are a further threat. An impoverishment of food resources and lack of mature trees for nest sites  are feared to limit the effective population size. Tourist and associated developments are destroying habitat, especially on Margarita, where the principal breeding, roosting and feeding-sites are threatened by unregulated mining for construction materials (Collar 1997; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. Dry forests and spiny scrub cover have become extensively reduced on Margarita and are now considered to be among the most endangered ecosystems on this island (Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020). On Bonaire, natural vegetation has been heavily degraded historically  for timber and charcoal production, and more recently through intensive  grazing by goats and donkeys, drastically reducing natural food species  diversity and availability (A. O. Debrot <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2007)<strong></strong>. In the eastern part of the mainland range, habitat is being lost through timber extraction and urban and industrial development (V. S. D'Angelo <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Habitat modification for aquaculture and shrimp farming is an emerging threat in the western part of the mainland range (E. Blanco <em>per </em>Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160; <br/>Introduced mammalian predators appear to limit its reproductive potential on Bonaire (R. Martin and S. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2007; Martin 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Also on La Blanquilla, introduced predators including domestic cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are feared to drive a population decline (Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><p></p>","The overall population size is unclear and difficult to assess. The subpopulation on Margarita Island was estimated at 1,600 individuals in 2019 (J. M. Briceño-Linares <em>per </em>Provita <em>in litt</em>. 2020), which equates to roughly 1,000 mature individuals. The subpopulation on Bonaire numbered around 700 individuals in 2017 (DCNA 2018), equating to 450 mature individuals. The most recent estimate from La Blanquilla is from 1996-1998, when the island held around 100 individuals (Sanz and Rodríguez-Ferraro 2006), equating to roughly 60 mature individuals. The subpopulation in north-western Venezuela was estimated at over 5,000 individuals in 2012 (V. Sanz <em>in litt.</em> 2016), equating to roughly 3,300 mature individuals. In view of the ongoing threats, it is suspected that this subpopulation has declined since then (Ferrer-Paris <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are no estimates for the subpopulation in north-eastern Venezuela, but based on observational records (eBird 2021), it is may be smaller than the north-western subpopulation (Ferrer-Paris <em>et al</em>. 2014). Based on the available values for the subpopulation sizes, assuming that the subpopulation in north-western Venezuela is now below 3,300 mature individuals, and accounting for a subpopulation of unknown size in north-eastern Venezuela, it is preliminarily inferred that the total population numbers between 2,500 and 9,999 mature individuals.&#160; <br/>The species is assumed to form five subpopulations; on Bonaire, La  Blanquilla, Margarita, in north-western Venezuela and north-eastern  Venezuela. It is thought that the largest subpopulation is found in north-western Venezuela (C. Sharpe <em>in litt</em>. 2021), which numbered up to 3,300 mature individuals in 2012 but has likely declined since then.

In 2010, the NGO Echo Bonaire was established to address threats through research and monitoring. Habitat restoration in ongoing; in 2006 and 2007, reforestation of the Washington-Slagbaai park began by successful reintroduction of rare native drought-resistant berry and fruit bearing tree species. In 2007, a fence to exclude goats from a large section of the park was restored (A. O. Debrot <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Supplemental feeding has also been carried out during extreme droughts (A. O. Debrot <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2007). In 2011  and 2012, 24 captive-reared birds were released on Bonaire (R.

The repair of natural nesting cavities has proved more successful (Sanz <em>et al</em>. 2003); Provita carry out guarding of nest sites to protect nestlings from poachers and allow them to fledge.

200639312,8540,Felis chaus,Least Concern,,2021,2014-06-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Jungle Cat remains probably the most common cat species in South Asia (India, Nepal, Bangladesh), where the majority of the global population occurs and despite likely extensive declines in mainland Southeast Asia, where the species is now extremely scarce and largely restricted to remote lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Gray <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014), it is unlikely that globally averaged declines are sufficient to merit Near Threatened status. Population declines and range contraction are also of concern elsewhere in the species’ range particularly in Egypt (Glas 2013), southwest Asia (Abu-Baker<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2003), the Caucasus (IUCN 2007), central Asia (Habibi 2004) and parts of Turkey (Ogurlu <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, very little new information has been obtained from these regions since the previous assessment. Nevertheless,<strong> </strong>ongoing collation of records, particularly from South Asia, is needed and evidence of declines, particularly outside protected areas may merit reassessment.<br/><br/>In India, there is evidence of continued, and likely accelerating, habitat loss and ongoing poaching for both skins and, potentially, as a result of conflict with farmers (Choudhury 2010, Chowdhury <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2015, S. Mukherjee in litt. 2014, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014, D. Jathana in litt. 2014). The Jungle Cat's preference for open scrub and grassland in South Asia makes the species more susceptible to habitat loss than cat species which also utilise denser evergreen forests.<br/><br/>The majority of the suitable Indian habitat is classified as ‘wasteland’ which legally eases conversion into any other form of use particularly industrialisation and urbanization – the latter has been identified as a particular threat in India given the pace of urbanisation of agricultural and unprotected forest areas (S. Mukherjee in litt. 2014, D. Jathana in litt. 2014). Hybridisation with domestic cats is also a potential, although unproven, threat. There remains uncertainty as to how the species will respond to habitat loss, and potential interactions with hunting and persecution. Therefore, further research is recommended, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, in order to gather additional data for a more thorough future assessment of the species' likely trends in response to habitat loss. Generally, more information on the species' ecology, distribution and status is needed across its range.","The Jungle Cat, despite its name, is not strongly associated with the classic rainforest ""jungle"" habitat, but rather with wetlands - habitats with water and dense vegetative cover, especially reed swamps, marsh, and littoral and riparian environments - scrubland, and deciduous dipterocarp forest (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Water and dense ground cover can be found in a variety of habitats, ranging from desert (where it is found near oases or along riverbeds) to grassland, shrubby woodland and dry deciduous forest, as well as cleared areas in moist forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Areas with extensive deciduous dipterocarp forest and at least scattered surface water are the species predominant known habitat in Indochina. However, areas such as the Nakai Plateau which support other forms of savanna-like vegetation may support the species. It is probably absent from all closed canopy forests, including rainforest. The species may make use of agricultural areas with a low intensity of human use and which retain patches of scrub (Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2005).&#160;In Iran, the Jungle Cat was found in a variety of habitats such as from plains, agriculture lands and mountains but was mostly found in shrub lands and woodlands (Sanei&#160;<em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;</em>2016). In&#160;the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation), the favourite habitat of it was reed thickets, thorn bush thickets and thick lowland forests near water bodies (Yarovenko 2014).&#160;An analysis of habitat preferences, from camera-trap photographs, in eastern Cambodia demonstrated a strong preference for deciduous dipterocarp forests with no encounters (c.f. Leopard cat) in other forest types (Gray&#160;<em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Jungle cats have adapted well to irrigated cultivation, having been observed in many different types of agricultural and forest plantations throughout their range, such as sugar cane plantations in India.  In Israel, they can be found around pisciculture ponds and irrigation ditches.  Vereschagin (1959) noted that the Jungle Cat's use of the semi-arid plains of Azerbaijan increased with the development of a local irrigation system and decreased with its abandonment.  However, mowing the seasonally flooded riverine tugai vegetation (trees and shrubs with dense stands of tall reeds and grasses) of this region for livestock fodder, as well as ploughing it under for agriculture, is known to be associated with the decline of Jungle Cat populations in the European-central Asian parts of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Apparently, Jungle Cats are also able to tolerate urban environments to some degree as they have been found on the campus of Pulchowk Engingeering College in the middle of Lalitpur, Nepal (Basnet <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In India, in a study in the Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, the Jungle Cat was mostly active in the night hours (Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> </em>2011), whereas in Cambodia, Jungle Cats were found to be more active during the day (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> </em>2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Jungle Cats feed mainly on prey that weighs less than one kilogram.  Small mammals, principally rodents,  are the prey most frequently found in faeces and stomach contents (Adhya 2014, Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). A study in India's Sariska reserve estimated that Jungle Cats catch and eat three to five rodent per day (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004).  Birds rank second in importance, but in southern Russia waterfowl are the mainstay of Jungle Cat diet in the winter.  With overwintering populations of waterfowl congregating in large numbers on unfrozen rivers and marshes, the Jungle Cat hunts among reed beds and along edges of wetlands, searching for injured or weakened birds.  Other prey species are taken more opportunistically, including hares, nutria, lizards, snakes, frogs, insects, and fish (Majumder <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Ogurlu <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Sunquist and Sunquist 2002,&#160;Patel 2011). In India, they have been seen to scavenge kills of large predators such as the Asiatic lion.  In a study in southern Uzbekistan, the fruits of the Russian olive made up 17% of their diet in winter.  While Jungle Cats specialize on small prey, they are large and powerful enough to kill young swine, subadult gazelles, and chital fawns (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Density estimates from natural tugai habitat in Central Asia range from 4-15 individuals per 10 km², but where this vegetation type has declined due to development density it does not exceed 2 cats per 10 km² (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","The biggest threat to Jungle Cat is habitat loss&#160;particularly industrialisation and urbanisation of low intensity agricultural areas and scrubland in the Indian subcontinent. Habitat destruction for agricultural purposes and infrastructure development are also issues in Turkey and Iran (Ogurlu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2010, Sanei<em> <em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016). In Turkey, wetlands are mainly threatened by dam constructions and irrigation projects (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014). Additionally, environmental pollution and illegal hunting are threatening the Jungle Cat in Turkey too (Ogurlu <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Also in Iran, illegal killing of Jungle Cats by shooting or trapping is a threat (Sanei <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2016). Jungle Cats can do well in cultivated landscapes (especially those that lead to increased numbers of rodents) and artificial wetlands. However, reclamation and destruction of natural wetlands, ongoing throughout its range but particularly in the arid areas, still pose a threat to the species, as density in natural wetlands is generally higher (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Nevertheless, the species' response to urbanisation and degradation of low intensity agricultural landscapes is unclear and merits further research.<br/><br/>Unselective trapping, snaring and poisoning around agricultural and settled areas have caused population declines in many areas throughout its range (Abu-Baker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). Moreover, some farmers consider the Jungle Cat a pest which takes poultry (Abu-Baker <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160; Some illegal trade is taking place in Asia such as in India, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nepal as well as in Egypt (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Habibi 2004, Shepherd and Nijam 2008, Choudhury 2010, Glas 2013, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2015, Altaf <em>et al</em>. 2017, Min <em>et al</em>. 2018, McEvoy <em>et al</em>. 2019). The scarcity of Jungle Cat in mainland Southeast Asia is likely the result of high levels of hunting in open and accessible deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).","In Europe, the Jungle Cat is of marginal occurrence, with small populations in Cis-Caspian region and the Caucasus along the Caspian Sea. The European population has been rapidly declining since the 1960s. There were no records of this species in Astrakhan State Reserve (Russian Federation) since the 1980s. In Northern Ossetia (Russian Federation) only about 150 animals were recorded (Kuryatnikov and Varziev 1983).&#160;In the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation), the number of Jungle Cats was estimated at 105 animals in 2009, at 216 in 2010, at 177 in 2011, at 110 in 2012 and at 307 animals in 2013, showing population fluctuations (Yarovenko 2014).&#160;Marked population fluctuations are characteristic of this species in this region, probably because of absence of adaptations to cold winters. Despite these fluctuations the long-term trend in Europe is of decline in both population and in area of occupancy. Data from Russia suggest that there are about 500 animals left in the wild (Prisazhnyuk and Belousova 2007). A very small population persists in Georgia (I. Macharashvili pers. comm. to K. Tsysulina 2007). This species is considered threatened in a number of range states in Europe and the Caucasus, and is included in the Red Books of the Russian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia (IUCN 2007). In Israel’s National Red List the Jungle cat is listed as Vulnerable (Dolev and Perevolotsky 2004).<br/><br/>In southwest Asia the species is considered rare and threatened (Abu-Baker&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Habibi 2004). However, the Jungle Cat is considered common in some parts of its range, primarily in India (Mukherjee 1998, Patel 2011), but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2005). In the respective National Red Lists, the Jungle Cat is listed as Near Threatened in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and as Least Concern in Nepal where its population is estimated to exceed 10,000 individuals (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2011, IUCN Bangladesh 2015, Ratnayaka 2018). In China’s National Red List it is listed as Endangered (Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2016). Generally in Southeast Asia, it appears quite rare in comparison to sympatric small cats (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2005). This rarity appears to be a relatively recent phenomenon associated with unselective trapping and snaring, especially in Lao PDR and Thailand as well, where it was described as common by Lekagul and McNeely (1977) but has since suffered drastic declines and is rarely encountered (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2005, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). There are a number of recent camera-trap records from the Eastern Plains Landscape protected area complex in eastern Cambodia (Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014) and this area likely remains the stronghold of the species outside South Asia.",Decreasing,"The Jungle Cat has a broad but patchy distribution.  In Africa, it is found only in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley south to Aswan, and in El Faiyum, Farafara, Dakhla and Kharga oases (Glas 2013). In Southwest Asia its occurrence is highly localized around riparian vegetation and permanent water sources.&#160;It occurs through Israel, Lebanon, northwestern Jordan, western Syria, into southern Turkey, and in Iraq. In Iran, it is reported from large parts of the country except in the centre and some regions in the west and along the Persian Gulf. In the north, it is found from the provinces of Khorasan, Golestan and Mazandaran westwards along the Caspian Sea coastline and Hyrcanian forests to the West Azerbaijan Province (Abu-Baker <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2003, Sanei <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>In Turkey, the Jungle Cat has a fragmented distribution and seems to be quite widely distributed in the south of the country but to be restricted especially to wetland areas (Gerngross 2014). Jungle Cat presence was recently recorded around the Büyük Menderes Delta, Aydin Province, in the Akyatan Wildlife Conservation and Development Area, Akyatan Lagoon, Adana Province, and close to Manavgat, Antalya Province (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014).&#160;However, its status in Turkey is not known (Avgan 2009).<br/><br/>The Jungle Cat is found in the Caucasus mountains (up to 1,000 m) including Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia. It occurs west and south of the Caspian Sea as well as south and east of the Aral Sea and associated river valleys. In Central Asia, it is found in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan (T. Rosen and R. Kulenbekov, pers. comm. 2020). In 2017, the Jungle Cat was recorded in the Chuy region in northern Kyrgyzstan. How or if this presence record is connected to the distribution range of the species in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan is still unknown.<br/><br/>The Jungle Cat’s distribution extends into South Asia from Pakistan through&#160;almost all of India as well as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal ranging up to 4,000 m in the Himalayan foothills (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2011). The Jungle Cat occurs through Southeast Asia including Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos PDR and Viet Nam, to southern China, but is absent from Malayan peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Its range in Indochina is poorly known.  Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2005) reviewed the few historical distribution records from Indochina and added several recent ones from Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam.","Some illegal trade (and killing) continues in India (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010) and elsewhere in South Asia (Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2015, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014) as well as in Egypt (Glas 2013) and Afghanistan (Habibi 2004). India formerly exported large numbers of Jungle Cat skins before the species came under legal protection (over 300,000 were declared as being held by traders there when export was banned in 1979; Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010). In India and Pakistan Jungle Cats are sometimes used for medicinal and/or ornamental purposes (Vijayakumar 2015, Altaf <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Myanmar, Jungle Cats were found on sale at markets, albeit rarely in comparison with other felid species detected, and reported to be regularly hunted in a nationwide hunter survey in 2018 (Shepherd and Nijam 2008, Min <em>et al</em>. 2018, McEvoy <em>et al</em>. 2019). The skin of a single Jungle Cat was also among seized wildlife parts between 2003 and 2013 in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal (Dangol 2015).",Terrestrial,"The Jungle Cat is listed on CITES Appendix II.  It is protected from hunting in some range states (India), but in many it receives no legal protection outside protected areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species now receives legal protection from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan after being placed on the country’s 2009 Protected Species List. Furthermore, given the amount of habitat loss occurring in riparian and wetland areas in Afghanistan, this species should be considered a research priority.<br/><br/>The ecology and status of the Jungle Cat is poorly known (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Southwest and Southeast Asia, where it is considered rare and declining, more research needs to be undertaken to gain knowledge of current distribution, both in and outside of protected areas (Abu-Baker <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).  Some farmers consider the Jungle Cat a pest which takes poultry (Abu-Baker <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003), and conservation measures should include better protection for domestic fowl and halting of indiscriminate poisoning and trapping.  The Jungle Cat would also benefit from improved protection of natural wetlands and reedbeds, particularly in the more arid parts of its range, and improved legislation prohibiting fur trade.<br/><br/>The Jungle Cat was recorded in 13 protected areas in Iran (Sanei<em> <em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2016). There are recent Jungle Cat records from protected areas in India as from Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Andhar Pradesh, Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve, Biligri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve, Mundumalai Tiger Reserve and from Mana National Park (Behera and Borah 2010, Borah&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2012, Choudhury 2010, Kalle&#160;<em><em>et al.</em>&#160;</em>2013, Kumara&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2014).&#160;In 2013, its presence was recorded in Chitwan National Park, Nepal (Lamichhane <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2014). There are also a number of recent records from protected areas from eastern Cambodia such as from the Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Channa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Gray <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014) as well as from Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand (Borries and Koenig 2014) and from the Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar (Linnell <em><em>et al.</em></em> no date).&#160;However, all protected areas in Cambodia are insufficiently managed and threatened by habitat loss, degradation, and hunting.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
202126091,22697805,Eudyptula minor,Least Concern,,2020,2020-09-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The global population size has been quantified and estimated as under 500,000 breeding adults. The population trend is stable overall with localised decreases in population size, usually driven by human disturbance and climatic variability. Increasing ocean temperature and strong winds are linked to negative effects on adult foraging and chick survival. The stable trend should be taken cautiously as 60% of the sites have an “unknown” population trends due to data deficiency. In Australia, there is a decrease in the population size in New South Wales and South Australia while Tasmania is data deficient. Populations are stable in WA and increasing in Victoria. In New Zealand, the situation of the species remains unclear due to inconsistent monitoring efforts over large parts of the country. Little penguins along the South Island’s West Coast, Banks Peninsula seem to be decreasing over the past decades while penguin numbers around Oamaru are stable if not increasing. Although the species has a large estimated extent of occurrence, about 69% of sites have fewer than 100 breeding individuals. For the remaining sites, 28% have between 100 and 5000 individuals and only 3% of sites have a population size above 5,000 individuals. Sites with small populations are more vulnerable with reported local extinctions. Several sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease in population size, while many former breeding colonies no longer exist. The population range and size do not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable criteria (extent of occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and &lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p>","<p>The little penguin (<em>Eudyptula minor</em>), the smallest of all penguins (~30-40 cm), is endemic to southern Australia and New Zealand, breeding during the austral autumn to summer months. These dark indigo-blue coloured penguins are the only genuinely nocturnal penguin species on land; adults always arrive after dusk and leave before dawn (Klomp &amp; Wooller 1991, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2007, Rodríguez <em>et al. </em>2016). The global population is estimated as 469,760 individuals. The little penguin population trend is stable overall with localised decrease in some sites. This species is a generalist feeder with significant variability in diet between colonies and even between years at the same colony (Klomp and Wooller 1988, Gales &amp; Pemberton 1990, Cullen <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fraser and Lalas 2004, Chiaradia<em> et al.</em> 2010, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2016). They feed mainly on clupeids such as anchovy <em>Engraulis</em> sp and sardines <em>Sardinops sagax </em>when feeding chicks but they may also feed on krill <em>Nyctiphanes australis </em>and several species of cephalopods at all stages of breeding (Gales &amp; Pemberton 1990, Cullen <em>et al.</em> 1992, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2016) and jellyfish (Cavallo <em>et al.</em> 2018). This variability in the diet is also found in their trophic interactions where penguins can reduce the prey trophic range in response to years of low breeding success (Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2010) and segregate foraging areas within the same colony (Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2018). The species dives to a maximum 72 metres, with a preferred depth zone between 20 to 30 metres (Chiaradia <em>et al. </em>2007, Ropert-Coudert <em>et al. </em>2009)</p><p>Penguins typically lay two eggs per clutch (Stahel <em>et al. </em>1987), and up to three clutches over a breeding season (Johannesen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The penguins exhibit six main breeding stages: courtship, pre-laying exodus, pre-laying, incubation, guard and post-guard (Chiaradia &amp; Kerry 1999); followed by moulting and inter-breeding stages (Salton <em>et al.</em> 2015). When feeding chicks, some parents make more foraging trips than their mates. This situation represents the norm (72% of cases), rather than the previously expected equal parenting (Saraux<em> et al.</em> 2011). Individuals can also alternate between two consecutive long foraging trips and several shorter ones throughout the chick-rearing period (Saraux<em> et al. </em>2011). Short trips allow for regular food provisioning of chicks (high feeding frequency and larger meals), whereas longer trips are triggered by a parent’s low body mass and therefore the need to replenish its energy reserves. Little penguins form groups when crossing the beach to nesting sites and individuals seem to choose their travelling partners (Daniel<em> et al. </em>2007). When foraging,&#160; some individuals can take advantage of human-made features, like ship channels to aid in their foraging (Preston <em>et al.</em> 2008). Breeding age, ranging from 2 to 18+ years, seems to play a crucial role as well, as middle-aged (8-12 years) penguins are better breeders (Nisbet &amp; Dann 2009), employ more effective foraging strategies (Zimmer <em>et al. </em>2011) and feed in different locations (Pelletier<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p><p></p>","<p>Many populations of little penguins are severely threatened by human disturbance such as introduced predators, domestic dogs, roadkill, coastal development, watercraft injuries, oil spills and gillnet fishing in both Australia and New Zealand (Cannel <em>et al.</em> 2016; Chiaradia 2013, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017, Dann 2013). Reduction in prey abundance is another major vulnerability to little penguin populations (Cannel <em>et al. </em>2016; Chiaradia 2013) as well as natural predators such as fur seals and corvids (Ekanayake at al. 2015a,b). Changes in the abundance of major prey can result in a dramatic change in their diet composition and trophic interactions, resulting in increased mortality and decreased breeding success (Dann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>A newer and additional challenge for this species is in the fast-changing marine and terrestrial environment, particularly in the rapidly warming sea of south-eastern Australia (Ramirez <em>et al.</em> 2017, Voice <em>et al.</em> 2006; Wu<em> et al. </em>2012), wherein southwestern Australia the warming sea has been associated with poorer breeding (Cannell <em>et al. </em>2012). Penguins have also been shown to catch less prey under warmer conditions (Carroll <em>et al. </em>2016). Oceanographic change may lead to a mismatch between plankton and the small pelagic fish that are also penguin prey (Hinder<em> et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Increasing terrestrial temperatures in the spring and summer months can cause fatal hyperthermia in both chicks and adults (Cannell <em>et al.</em> 2011, Cannell <em>et al. </em>2012, Cannell <em>et al.</em> 2016). This issue is particularly relevant in those colonies where nesting occurs within the vegetation rather than in burrows as a result of a soft, sandy substrate. <br/><br/>Remarkably, some of these pressures can be locally offset by a wide range of conservation efforts, such as the case of increasing population size at Phillip Island (Sutherland &amp; Dann 2012, 2014), St Kilda (Preston <em>et al.</em> 2010; Preston 2011), Manly (Carlile<em> et al. </em>2015), Oamaru (Agnew <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160; Sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease, where many known breeding colonies no longer exist (Dann 1994; Stevenson &amp; Woehler 2007, Wilson &amp; Mattern 2019). Local extinction of many small colonies continues in Australia and New Zealand.</p>","<p>The global population size has been quantified for most sites, with the current population estimate of 469,760 breeding adults. This population size is smaller than the previously estimate, where the total population was only considered as under 1,000,000 individuals, but was based on non-quantified data. With quantified data, there is an increase of 18% in population size when historic and recent data are compared. However, this increase should be interpreted with caution as it is very likely to be related to improved population survey effort rather than an actual increase in population. For sites with current population estimates, 60% of the sites have an “unknown” trend due to data deficiency. Nevertheless, for the sites where data were available, 51% of sites were stable, 29% deteriorating and 20% improving. Fifteen sites are suspected extinct.</p>",Stable,"<p>Endemic to Australia and New Zealand.

Various local media outlets report updates on penguin colonies and research, and puppet-shows and door-to-door canvassing is also carried out. The species occurs in many national and state parks, such as Penguin, Breaksea and Cheyne Islands and also in Shoalwater Island Marine Park, for which there is a Marine Park Management Plan.

It is a wide-ranging species inhabiting continental and insular shelves over mud and sand, seagrass, coral reefs, estuaries, shallow bays and channels from inshore to 90 m deep. The Bonnethead Shark&#160;is likely a species complex, with three distinct elements:&#160;the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (United States of America (USA), Bahamas, and Mexico), the Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic&#160;(Belize south to Brazil, including Panama and Trinidad and Tobago), and the&#160;<a style="""">Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific.&#160;</a>The species has among the highest population growth rates calculated for sharks, making it much less sensitive to fishing mortality than most other species of sharks. It is caught as target and bycatch in coastal gillnet and longline fisheries and as bycatch in shrimp fisheries. Despite its high productivity, drastic inferred declines have been reported throughout its range. The Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (USA, Bahamas, and Mexico) is stable due to management and in that region is assessed as Near Threatened. The Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic portion of the population has been reduced substantially in size. This shark was commonly encountered in the 1980s off the Caribbean Colombia, but is now very rare. In Brazil, this species was assessed regionally as Extinct off the state of Rio de Janeiro, collapsed in São Paulo, and Vulnerable in Espírito Santo State due to overfishing. There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state, and fishers describe this species as being depleted and the species in that region is assessed as Critically Endangered. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, this species was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico. Artisanal fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks, including Bonnethead Shark, in the 1990s. Records of this species became increasingly rare since the 1980s, and the species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca. This shark has not been encountered in Central America since the 1980s. Its recent absence from large parts of its range in Central and South America and rarity of recent records across this part of its range infer that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (36 years) and it is assessed in that region as Critically Endangered. Overall, the combination of low fishing mortality in throughout the USA, declines in Atlantic Central America, combined with widespread disappearance in Southwest Atlantic and Pacific this species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing and habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development and shrimp aquaculture, and hence it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>The Bonnethead Shark inhabits continental and insular shelves over mud and sand, seagrass, coral reefs, estuaries, shallow bays and channels from shore to 90 m depth (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL).&#160;The life history of this species has received considerable attention. Empirical data for populations of this species in the eastern Gulf of Mexico reveal a latitudinal increase in maximum size, size-at-maturity, and offspring size (Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al. </em>2003). In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, males mature between 68–85 cm TL (2 years of age) and females generally mature between 80–95 cm TL (or 2–3 years of age) depending on geographic area. Reproduction is placental viviparous and annual, with a litter size of 4–16 pups and size-at-birth of 35–40 cm TL. The gestation period of this species is one of the shortest known in sharks, lasting ~4.5–5 months (Parsons 1993, Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al. </em>2003). Demographic studies of this species by Cortés (2002) indicate that Bonnethead Shark have very high rate of population growth (mean = 1.304 per yr; 95% confidence interval = 1.150–1.165 per yr) making them one of the most productive species. In the Gulf of Mexico, maximum observed ages are 5–6 years or more for males and 7–8 years or more for females (Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2003). Recent work off the southeastern coast of the United States has produced validated maximum age estimates of 16.0 years for males and 17.9 years for females (Frazier <em>et al. </em>2014). Generation length is estimated to be 12 years.</p><a></a>","<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><p>First, in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic,&#160;Bonnethead Shark is captured in primarily in gillnets, demersal trawls and recreationally on hook and line. Recreational catches averaged 12,898 individuals from 2012 to 2016 and commercial landings averaged 15,305 lbs dressed weight from 2011 to 2016.

In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). This species is the fourth most commonly-caught shark in artisanal longlines and gillnets (O. Lasso unpubl. data 2019). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em><span class=""text"">2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2015). Gillnets and artisanal longlines are prevalent along much of Brazil's coast, and this species is captured by them (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2014). In Uruguay, the industrial demersal trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many target stocks were overexploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2011).</span></span></p><p>Third, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, gillnets that often target sharks have been operating since at least mid-century in the Gulf of California, and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and other marine life (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Artisanal fisheries targeting sharks including this species have been operating around Mazatlan since at least the 1960s (Kato 1965). Later research has revealed that this species is no longer present in the Gulf of California and that very few records have come from the southern portion of Mexico (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). Further south in this portion of the species' range, heavy artisanal fishing pressure exists with little management in place, and there are unmanaged commercial longline and trawl fisheries off parts of western Central and South America.<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""> This  species may also suffer from&#160;habitat loss due to coastal development  and the conversion of mangrove forest to shrimp aquaculture is  detrimental to this species.<br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></span>","In the United States, highly significant genetic differences were observed among Bonnethead Shark from the Atlantic coast of Florida, Gulf coast of Florida, and southwestern Gulf of Mexico (Escatel-Luna <em>et al. </em>2015). Population trend data are available from broad-scale trends in relative abundance for the northwest Atlantic Ocean (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2017), a fishery-independent demersal trawl survey (Pollack 2018), and stock assessments for the US south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (NMFS 2013). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al.</em> 2018, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;<span><span><br/><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span>First, in the Northwest Atlantic, Bonnethead Shark is a very abundant, small hammerhead found in shallow estuaries and bays. It is caught as target and bycatch in gillnet fisheries, and as bycatch in shrimp fisheries. In the United States, Bonnethead Shark had undergone declines prior to management measures, and since the 1990s scientific surveys have demonstrated large increases in abundance. A stock assessment for the Gulf of Mexico and US south Atlantic found the stock was not overfished but some sensitivity analysis suggests it was overfished. The weighted overall population trend for the Northwest Atlantic estimated a 40% increase over 3 generation lengths (36 years). However, outside the United States (where quota management used), Mexico (where a closed season is implemented), and the Bahamas (where there is no shark harvest), where management may not exist, the species is captured in artisanal fisheries and as bycatch in shrimp trawl and lobster fisheries (e.g. juvenile sharks in Costa Rica). There is a directed fishery in Quintana Roo, Mexico where the species is the third most important catch. It is present in landings in Cuba, Belize (mostly adults), Trinidad, and Panama (third most abundant species in gillnet fisheries). Expert judgement elicitation found that given the uncertainty in levels of harvest and its sustainability, Bonnethead Shark should be assessed as Near Threatened in this region.&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Second, the&#160;the Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&#160;portion of the population has been reduced substantially&#160;in size. Off Caribbean Colombia, this shark was commonly encountered in the 1980s, but is now very rare (P.A. Mejía Falla and A.F. Navia/Squalus Foundation unpubl. data 2018). In Venezuela, this species remains among the most commonly caught shark but is subjected to heavy and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it has suspected to have declined there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across The Guianas. In Brazil, Bonnethead Shark was assessed regionally as Extinct off the state of Rio de Janeiro (Bizzeril and Costa 2001), collapsed in São Paulo (Bressan <em>et al. </em>2009), and Vulnerable in Espírito Santo State due to overfishing&#160;(Passamani and Mendes 2007). There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state. Although several individuals were recorded there in a 2012–2013 study, the only other record since the 1980s is one from 1995 (Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014). Overall in Atlantic South America, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to heavy and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, and there have been very few recent records in Brazil. It is therefore inferred that the Atlantic South American portion of this species' population has undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Third, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, this species was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico (Hernandez-Carvallo 1967). Artisanal fisheries there began targeting large predatory sharks prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965), and in the 1970s and 1980s the use of gillnets increased rapidly. After depleting the large predatory sharks, these fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks, including this species, in the 1990s (Sala <em>et al.</em> 2004). Records of this species became increasingly rare since the 1980s, and the species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). This shark has not been encountered in Central America since the 1980s. There are more recent records in Colombia and Ecuador, but they are rare (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). There were records in the industrial trawl fishery in Colombia in the 1990s, but surveys of this fishery in 2007 did not record any <em>Sphyrna</em> species. This species is rare in gillnet and beach seine catches in Ecuador (A. Cevallos unpubl. data 2019). Overall in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, due to heavy and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, its recent absence from large parts of Mexico and Central America, and rarity of recent records across this part of its range, it is inferred that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><p>Overall,

lang=""EN-GB"">The Bonnethead Shark occurs in the both the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans.&#160;This is likely a complex of three geographically discrete three species: (1) the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (USA, Bahamas, and Mexico), (2) the Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic&#160;(Belize south to Brazil, including Panama and Trinidad and Tobago), and (3) the&#160;Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. In the Atlantic it ranges from Rhode Island, USA, to at least Bahía in Brazil and possibly Uruguay and in&#160;the Pacific it from southern California to Peru (Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013, D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019, D. Chapman unpubl. data 2020).</p><p></p>","Bonnethead Shark are utilised for their meat and fins. Meat is consumed or sold locally and the fins are traded internationally (Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2020). Based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong in 2014–2015, Bonnethead Shark makes up 0.06% of the fin trade (Fields <em>et al. </em>2018).",Marine,"<p>In the USA in 2006, National Marine Fisheries Service finalized the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Federal Management Plan. This Federal Management Plan includes a range of management measures including quotas and seasonal closures. Bonnetheads are managed under this plan. There are also coastal gillnet bans in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas which will also provide protection for the species.&#160;</p><p>In Mexico, there is a closed season for the shark fishery in May and June in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Quintana Roo, and May 15 to June 15, and August 1–29 in the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Yucatán. The Official Standard NOM-029-PESC-2007 establishes management measures that finning prohibited and the protection of some species (whale shark, white shark, basking shark, sawfishes, and species of Mobula). It also establishes that fishing is prohibited at the surrounding area of 5 km of coral reef areas, at adjacent areas in front of mouth rivers and coastal lagoons (delimited by a semicircle of 2.5 km in the mouth), and at nursery areas (prohibited the use of gill-nets in June) in front of Playa Bagdad, Tamaulipas. There is a marine protected area of 30 km from the mouth of the Rio Bravo to Conchinal; Terminos lagoon, Campeche; Usumacinta-Grijalva Rivers, Tabasco; Yalahau lagoon, Quintana Roo; and Espiritu Santo and Ascension Bays, Quintana Roo. There is also a Management Plan of the Natural Protected Area “Marine Biosphere Reserve of the Mexican Caribbean” that prohibits any elasmobranch fishery in all this biosphere reserve that comprises all Mexican Caribbean. There are enforcement problems.&#160;</p><p>In the Central America and Dominican Republic, the Regional Office of Fisheries of the Sistem of Integration of Central America, prohibit Shark Finning with the resolution OSP-05-11 in all of the Central American countries (from Belize to Panama), including the Dominican Republic.</p><p>In the Guatemalan Caribbean, there are fishing bans for one month (usually August) for the capture sharks (Families: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Triakidae, and Ginglymostomatidae) and two months (usually July and August) for rays (Family Dasyatidae). However, enforcement of these bans is a challenge.</p><p>In Honduras, there is a national regulation (Governmental Degree 107-2011) that declared the territorial waters of Honduras a shark sanctuary. Fishing and exploitation of all shark species was prohibited in all territorial waters of Honduras. This regulation was revised by a new regulation (Governmental Degree 26-2016), which indicated that sharks that are incidentally caught can be used. There are enforcement problems.</p><p>In Panama, there are some marine protected area in the middle and west of Panama, which can benefits shark populations because it establishes management in these areas like fishery controlled areas. However, enforcement is a challenge. In 2006, a regulation was approved that prohibited shark finning in Panama water. In 2017, another regulation was implemented for longline fisheries (e.g. limits of number of hooks up to 1,000 per surface longline strand).</p><p>In the Bahamas, longline fishing was banned in The Bahamas in 1993, and peak elasmobranch export occurred the same year (UN FAO). The export steadily declined until the last export of any elasmobranch product from The Bahamas occurred in 2004 (UN FAO). The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary was established in 2011 (Haas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), and it is currently illegal to fish for, land or possess any sharks or shark parts in The Bahamas. This protection does not extend to rays or skates. Enforcement is very underfunded and inadequate, making it possible that exploita on may be occurring at present or in the future.</p><p>The Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago developed draft NPOA – Sharks in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, these are still in draft form due to a combination of factors including lack of political will. For the Dutch Caribbean, spatial management measures have been implemented. The Yarari Marine Mammal and Shark Sanctuary was created in 2015 for Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba in the Caribbean Netherlands. In November 2011, the Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (MoU Sharks) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species.&#160;</p>In the Southwest Atlantic, this species is listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the  Environment Nº 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species  listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National  Red List (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018). This legislation came into force  in December 2014, however, it was suspended for all of 2015 and the  first half of 2016 due to pressure from the fishing industry (Begossi <em>et al. </em>2017).  The ordinance faces increasing industry pressure, including a court  challenge to suspend the legislation again, by the Secretaria Nacional  de Aquicultura e Pesca (SAP), who brought forward their contention that  the Brazilian National Red List was designed specifically for  terrestrial species (Spautz 2019). In the Eastern Pacific, there&#160;are no species-specific protections or  conservation measures in place for Bonnethead Shark in the Pacific  portion of its range. <p>  </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>  <p></p>","",,false,false,Global
