In Ghana, the fish has not been observed for many years (E.K. Abban pers. comm. 2019). Because it grows to a large size, it is caught by fishermen before reaching sexual maturity to reproduce. Other problems that may threaten this fish include increasing agricultural activities around the Volta river and the consequent problem of leaching of agrochemicals into water, and increase in sediment loads. In some parts of the Volta, aquatic weeds may also pose a threat to the fish.","In the Volta (Ghana) it is thought to be declining and has not been observed for many years (E.K.

It occurs from southern Mexico to Paraguay, including Trinidad, Argentina and Brazil. This fish is known to be a commonly used bait fish that also occasionally appears in the aquarium trade. The species is widespread and while it is possibly declining in parts of its range, it is not thought that any global population decline is likely to meet (or be close to meeting) the threshold for Vulnerable. Therefore the species is assessed as Least Concern.","<em>Gymnotus carapo</em>&#160;is known to inhabit turbid, slow moving or standing waters (Kenny, 1995), and can be found also in shallow edges of streams (Loureiro and Silva, 2006). It is known to survive dry-outs in ditches, canals and small ponds (Kenny, 1995) and will be found to feed mainly at night, on worms, insects (e.g. odonate larvae), shrimps, fish (preferably small characids, e.g. <em>Ctenobrycon</em> and <em>Curimata</em>) and plant matter (Mills and Vevers, 1989; Møller, 1995). It is an oviparous fish (Breder and Rosen, 1966) and mouth brooding by males has been observed (Crampton and Hopkins, 2005), with males providing parental care in nests excavated for eggs and larvae (Crampton and Hopkins, 2005). This species is a neotropical teleost that swims by means of an elongated ventral anal fin and can distinguish between a `friendly neighbour' and a potentially `threatening stranger' based on electric organ discharge (EOD) waveform alone (Møller, 1995). The maximum size of this species is 76 cm TL (unsexed).<br/><br/><em>Gymnotus carapo</em> are nocturnal predators of fishes and other small aquatic animals, and most are territorial (Crampton 1998).","This species is largely used in professional and sportive fishery, as live bait it is preferred by higher predator fish species (Vergilio,&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), and is also used in aquaculture for production.

1941346,190132,Haemulon plumierii,Least Concern,,2016,2015-10-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is widespread in the western Atlantic Ocean and can be among the most abundant of reef species in the Greater Caribbean. As with many congeners, there are few countries that have multi-year data especially at the species level. Based on recreational CPUE in Florida and overall landings in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic US, there are currently few indications of major regional declines in the US. There have been declines in mixed-haemulid catches in Cuba and other sites. This species is heavily harvested in Brazil, but as in most countries, species-level landing data are not available at scales to evaluate three generation lengths of information (estimated at between 12-27 years based on differing estimates of maximum age). <em>Haemulon plumierii</em> is listed as Least Concern. Long term monitoring of highly fished areas will help future efforts to assess the species with data that fulfil IUCN criteria.","<em>Haemulon plumierii</em> is a reef-associated species that occurs in subtropical waters (Cervigón 1993). Newly-settled and early juvenile life stages are encountered in very shallow hard-bottom and vegetated habitats throughout its range. Juveniles of this species are common in <em>Thalassia testudinum</em> beds (Cervigón <em>et al</em>. 1992). It feeds on crustaceans, small molluscs and small fishes. <em>Haemulon plumierii </em>uses seagrass beds as settlement areas and nursery grounds (Acosta<em> et al.</em> 2007). The juvenile usage of several backreef habitats in comparison to congeners is reviewed in Nagelkerken (2009). <em>Haemulon plumierii</em> displays diurnal migration related to foraging in some areas, leaving reefs at night to forage over grass and sand flats and returning to the reef by day for shelter. Various aspects of mixed schooling behaviour of this species have been identified in Brazil (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2013). It feeds on a variety of benthic invertebrates including: shrimps, crabs, polychaetes, snails, sipunculids, amphipods, ophiuroids, tunicates and echinoderms; but also feeds on fish as well.<br/><br/>Male White Grunt in the US Atlantic peak in spawning activity from March through to June, a similar spawning season to <em>H. plumierii</em> from the west coast of Florida (de Silva and Murphy 2001). White Grunt south of Florida have been reported to spawn in August and September as well as in the spring off Puerto Rico; in Jamaica, maximum spawning occurs during March and April (de Silva and Murphy 2001).<br/><br/>In a study on <em>H. plumierii </em>from the South Atlantic Bight, 50% of the female <em>H. plumierii</em> were mature at 16.7 cm TL (Potts 2000). For male <em>H. plumierii </em>50% were mature at 18.6 cm TL. In the Florida Keys, this species reaches sexual maturity at 1.5 years (Ault <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160;Annual modal lengths for <em>H. plumierii </em>sampled from commercial landings in the eastern US showed a modal fork length of 26 cm (de Silva and Murphy 2001). Growth is fast during the first four years of life in this species, when the average fish size is already in excess of 80% of the asymptotic size (Araújo and Martins 2007). Maximum total length for this species is 51-53 cm, but it is more commonly around 30 cm, and the maximum published weight is 4,380 g (Courtenay and Sahlman 1978, IGFA 1991, IGFA 2011). Using a maximum age of eight years (Ault <em>et al</em>. 1998), generation length was calculated at four to five years, with three generation lengths estimated at between 12 to 15 years. Using a maximum age of 18 years (Murie and Parkyn 2005), generation length was calculated at nine years, with three generation lengths estimated at 27 years. Comparatively, White Grunts from the Gulf coast of Florida were of similar size-at-age as fish from southeastern (Atlantic) Florida but were smaller than White Grunt from North and South Carolina (Chapman <em>et al. </em>1999, Murie and Parkyn 2005).","This species can be subject to localized fishing impacts. Due to its high abundance and intermediate size, this species can be harvested in very high numbers using various gears. Early life stages can be a component of shrimp bycatch in many areas. As in many grunts, its use of very shallow habitats for settlement and early juvenile grow-out can expose local populations to impacts from coastal development (Lindeman and Snyder 1999). Early life stages have been recorded in the diet of the invasive and prolific lionfish (Albins and Hixon 2008). Adults of the species are closely associated with corals and a variety of direct and indirect threats may arise with increasing climate change impacts on corals and associated habitats (Ateweberhan <em>et al</em>. 2013).","<span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""gs_a""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""gs_a""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""gs_a""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5"">This species is locally abundant, the most widely distributed species of the genus in the western Atlantic and common throughout its range. For example, in a survey on mid-shelf patch reefs within Biscayne National Park, Florida, in 2003, <em>H. plumierii </em>was the most abundant species (Kuffner<em> et al. </em>2007). This species was recorded with a high frequency (99% SF) and a low abundance score (ranging from 0.9 to 2.8 per sighting) from 18 sites in the Dry Tortugas National Park (Pattengill-Semmens and Akins 2002). During a survey of seagrass beds in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary between 1999-2001, <em>H. plumierii</em> had a frequency of occurrence of 64.7% in the Gulf of Mexico side and 33.0% in the Atlantic Ocean (Acosta <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Recreational landings per boat trip from the Florida west coast were more or less stable at around four to six individuals from 1991-2013 (FWC 2014), and ranged in weight from a low of 133,828 individuals in 1986 to a high of 1,067,118 individuals in 2001, and at 823,982 individuals in 2014 (NMFS 2015a). Total commercial landings for this species in federal waters of the US Atlantic ranged from 4.9 mt in 1999 to 9.6 mt in 2013, with a high of 18.8 mt in 2008 (NMFS 2015b). The National Marine Fisheries Service conducted a population assessment of <em>H. plumierii</em>, which includes a specific assessment for the Carolinas and the Atlantic coast of Florida (de Silva and Murphy 2001). Spawning potential ratio (SPR) for <em>H. plumierii </em>in southeast Florida was estimated at 61%. The NMFS assessment concluded that by Federal standards the stock was not over-exploited by fishing. It was noted that the 1998 fishing mortality rate could be increased by a factor of three to increase the yield per recruit by 40% while maintaining the stock above 40% SPR (Potts 2000). In a 1999 stock assessment, the estimated average annual abundance varied around 1.0 million fish between 1994 and 1998 for the <em>H. plumierii</em> population on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Based on 1998 fishing mortalities, the static spawning potential ratios were estimated at about 32-35% (de Silva and Murphy 2001). Using data from the 1970s through the 1990s, Ault <em>et al.</em> (1998) estimated a SPR of 16%.<br/><br/>It is very common off Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico (M. Vega-Cendejas pers. comm. 2013. In Mexico, <em>H. plumierii</em> was recorded from eight stations in the Bocas de Dzilam Lagoon with 0.03 relative abundance (%N) and 0.02 biomass (%W) during a study conducted from 2003 to 2004 (Arceo-Carranza and Vega-Cendejas 2009). <br/><br/>This is the most abundant haemulid species in the commercial landings in Cuba. Mixed haemulid landings in Cuba over the past 40 years have fluctuated, but were relatively stable at 2,000 mt per year; then dropped to less than 1,000 mt in 2005 (R. Claro pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Caribbean, three genetically differentiated populations of <em>H. plumierii</em> have been identified using mitochondrial DNA: 1) a northern type found from the Carolinas south to the Florida Keys, and in Panama City, Gulf of Mexico; 2) a southern form found in the Florida Keys, Yucatan, Belize and Puerto Rico; and 3) a third form found exclusively in Trinidad (Chapman <em>et al</em>. 1999). This has been long documented as one of the most abundant and widespread reef fishes in the Caribbean. &#160;For example, a belt transect survey in eastern Saba Bank, Netherlands Antilles, from June through November, 2007, <em>H. plumierii </em>estimated a frequency of occurrence of 40% and the species was observed in 65% of locations (Toller<em> et al. </em>2010).&#160;In Brazil, Araújo and Martins (2007) estimated that the stock was under low to moderate levels of exploitation in the late 1990s on the central coast. Average annual fishing mortality rates indicated instantaneous fishing mortalities peaked at 0.47-0.49 per year in 1992, decreased through 1995 and has increased since. <br/><br/>In the Abrolhos Reef system in east Brazil, the species was ranked third in abundance of haemulids surveyed with 0.9% of total biomass (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008). In the Rio Grande do Norte region, the species is commonly harvested in fish traps (Cunha <em>et al. </em>2012).<span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span

It frequently occurs as bycatch in trawl and saltwater angler, but is purposefully avoided for nuisance reasons. The population appears to have declined along the eastern U.S. seaboard, but the drivers are not yet well understood. Due to its wide distribution and stable population in the Gulf of Mexico, it is not considered to be experiencing significant overall declines. Therefore, it is listed as Least Concern.","This species occurs in turbid waters over muddy bottoms chiefly along the coast and  in river estuaries. It prefers brackish marine waters and only occasionally  enters freshwater and is also found in seagrass ecosystems (Motta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et  al</span>. 1995). It is an opportunistic feeder on benthic crustaceans and small fishes as well as algae and seagrasses (Courtney <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the northern Gulf of Mexico, spawning occurs from May to early August. Following fertilization, males carry the eggs in their mouth for about a month. It may then carry the young larvae for a few more weeks until they are larger and stronger (Jones&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1978). It reaches sexual  maturity before two years of age (Benson 1982). The minimum size of a mature female is  15 cm (Lee 1937), with males maturing around 25 cm SL (Merriman  1940). Adults are commonly reported at sizes up to 70 cm (Acero 2002).  <p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","This species frequently occurs as bycatch in recreational and commercial coastal fisheries, however, they are purposefully avoided when possible due to their nuisance spines. There is no evidence that fishing bycatch is impacting its population on a global level.&#160;It appears to be declining in the portion of its range between North Carolina to northeastern Florida due to one of four causes: disease, harmful algal blooms, extremely low levels of dissolved oxygen, or water temperature. It is unknown which, if any of these are causing recent declines in catfish in South Carolina. It is unknown what other factors may affect the population, particularly the role that disease may play in continued apparent depression of this stock. Additionally, contaminants accumulated in muddy sediments, including metals, polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons and pesticide may directly affect this bottom-feeding species (P. Webster, unpublished report to South Carolina Department of Natural Resources). It is unclear what effect the Deep Water Horizon oil spill of 2010 may have on this species.&#160;It can suffer occasional mass mortalities during cold stun events in the Gulf of Mexico, however, the population in the Gulf is considered stable.","This species is common and can be very abundant in some areas.&#160;Hardhead catfish have been prominent in a number of mass mortality  incidents in the Gulf of Mexico and appear to be in decline along the  southeastern Atlantic coast (Wardle <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998, SEAMAP unpublished  data), especially during cold water events off Texas (J. Tolan pers. comm. 2014). The Gulf of Mexico population quickly rebounds from these mortality events and is not declining. As suggested by trawl surveys, abundance of the hardhead catfish  in South Carolina experienced two drastic drops during the 1990s.  Additional sampling along the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United  States indicated that abundance remains depressed from North Carolina to  Florida (SEAMAP unpublished data). Sampling conducted over the past<span style="""">&#160;eight years&#160;</span>in coastal waters between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Cape  Canaveral, Florida, indicate that this species may be in poorest  shape in the northern portion of its range. There was also evidence of decline in a survey conducted in the Terminos Lagoon, Mexico (Villeger <em>et al.</em> 2010). Despite reduced abundance  over the shallow coastal shelf, hardhead catfish are likely to be  encountered by anglers in estuaries, through the surf zone and into  near-coastal waters of the shelf. A true estimate of population size considering abundance through all of these habitats has not been  calculated (P. Webster unpublished report to South Carolina Department  of Natural Resources). Data from angler surveys and industrial trawls in the southeastern US and Gulf of Mexico likely underestimated catches of hardhead sea catfish, as they are frequently discarded at sea. Areas of high abundance are usually avoided as these fish are considered a nuisance (Muncy and Wingo 1983).",Stable,<p>This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from North Carolina south along the U.S. and throughout the Gulf of Mexico except northwestern Cuba (R.

Industrial and commercial catches of this species are purposefully low because areas with high abundance are avoided unless suitable higher valued fishes coexist. It is usually culled from trawl catches because of low consumer acceptance in pet food products or as human food fish (Benson 1982).&#160;Commercial and sport fishermen consider it to be a dangerous nuisance due to its large spines (Muncy and Wingo 1983).",Marine,"This species has no special protection under state or federal regulation.

This species can be found at altitude in excess of 1500 m above sea level (Gómez-Balandra <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>","<p>The primary threat to <em>N. calientis</em> is habitat degradation as a result of urban, industrial, and agricultural pollution (Lyons <em>et al</em>. 1998, Lyons <em>et al</em>. 2004), as well as in habitat fragmentation resulting from damming throughout its range (Gómez-Balandra <em>et al</em>. 20012, Mercado-Silva <em>et al</em>. 2006). There has been considerable degradation in the water quality of Rio Lerma in the 20th Century from the pollution of major urban, industrial, agricultural and livestock wastes (Sedeño-Díaz and López-López 2007). While more detailed population data are needed to estimate the magnitude of decline, <em>N. calientis</em> is considered sensitive to habitat degradation (Mercado-Silva <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>The establishment and spread of invasive species and their parasites (e.g. <em>Cyprinus carpio</em> and <em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) likely have an impact on the abundance of <em>N. calientis</em> and its close congeners (Contreras-Balderas <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>","<p>Data on the population size and population trend of <em>N. calientis</em> are limited.

However, the extent of range reduction is unknown. A study in 2011 visited most of the sites where the species had been recorded until then, and it was not found in 85% of the sites (Pedraza-Marrón 2011). The number of sites visited correspond to approximately 80% of the known sites of the species, and it is assumed that, given the occurrence of similar threats in the remaining sites, the decrease would be at least of 80% in those sites.

Its  habitats are similar to those of the North American darters (Percidae,&#160;genus <em>Etheostoma</em>)  living among and under rocks in shallow waters. At the Río El Terrero, the  long rocky riffles are separated by pools up to 8 x 20 m in major  dimensions. Miller and Uyeno (1980)&#160;found the water clear, but quite easily muddied  because of the silt amongst the rocks and boulders. He described the  water temperatures on several visits to the Río El Terrero and to the type  locality varying from 18 to 22 °C, with the air temperature generally  higher (24 to 28 °C). The depth varied between 2.5 m and 15 cm (Miller 2005).<br/><br/>Observations of Köck <em>et al.</em> in March 2016 in the Río Contla about 100 m north of the HW 110 bridge at Contla revealed a very shallow habitat with water depths less than 30 cm and a width of 3 to 4 m, in the rainy season expanding to a width of about 8 m inferred from the pebbly shore. The habitat was structured with few big rocks and boulders in the middle of the current and a lot of gravel of different sizes, mud, sand and silt. Few patches of submerse vegetation (Characeae) could be seen in the more quiet parts of the creek. The current was mainly swift, the water clear. The water parameters about noon were: pH 7.6, carbonate hardness 3°, total hardness 7°, water temperature 22 °C. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, a discharge of polluted water close to the bridge let the pH raise up to 8.6 and led to the occurrence of nitrite (1 mg/l) and nitrate (25 mg/l) that were absent above the discharge pipe. <em>Allodontichthys hubbsi </em>was associated with its congener <em>Allodontichthys tamazulae</em> (in about the same quantity), <em>Ilyodon whitei </em>(dominant species, about 90% of the total number of fish), <em>Poeclia butleri</em> and Tilapias (species not determined). The top predator seemed to be Dobsonfly larvae (subfamily Corydalinae, family Corydalidae) with about 10 - 12 cm total length that could be seen hunting successfully twice per 30 minutes. <br/><br/>The Río Tamazula east of Tamazula de Giordano has a width of 5 to 10 m, depth down to about 50 cm in the dry season. The bottom is comprised of big rocks and boulders, gravel, silt, mud and sand. The water in March 2016 was swift to torrential, depending on ground and width, and clear to murky. The water parameters were similar to the ones from the Río Contla. The species was associated with the same fish as in its affluent, additionally could be found a few <em>Xenotoca lyonsi</em>. The embankment was comprised by small trees (probably <em>Salix</em>), reed and few herbaceous riparian plants; the main sections of the riverbank were free of vegetation. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, very close were viscous remains of burnt sugar cane that would be washed in the river when raining.","Both subpopulations of&#160;<em>Allodontichthys hubbsi</em><em>&#160;</em>are mainly threatened by water pollution, caused by non-purified sewage of sugar cane mills, by urban sewage of middle sized towns and wash-ins of pesticides and fertilizers used in sugar cane production. Large areas of the Río Tamazula valley are covered by sugar cane fields, and agriculture has a massive negative impact on creeks draining the surrounding mountains and running through the fields. Observations through surveys up to recent years (2016) suggest that the species is now restricted to river sections and creeks above sugar cane mills.&#160;Further studies are in need to decide, if its sympatric congener <em>Allodontichthys tamazulae&#160;</em>displaces this species in areas of ecological pressure caused by human activities. Surveys throughout the last decades suggest that the Tamazula Splitfin might be able to handle bad conditions better than the Whitepatch Splitfin, as it is the only species of this genus which still occurs at its historical localities. In addition to pollution threats, there is also the presence of invasive species (e.g., tilapia).","There are two subpopulations: the Río El Tule subpopulation (encompassing fish from the Río El Terrero and the Arroyo San José de Tule with the type location at El Pozo Santo; Crucero del Tule), and the Río Tuxpán subpopulation from the lower Río Tuxpán.&#160;<br/><br/>Referring to the Río El Tule subpopulation, a survey by Lyons in 1999 did not result in any specimens in the Río El Terrero and only a few in the Arroyo San José del Tule. The water of this river is polluted by sewage from a sugar cane mill at San José del Tule so this subpopulation may be restricted, if still extant, to very few river kilometres.&#160;<br/><br/>Although there are historical records of a subpopulation from the upper Río Tuxpán, no specimens have been found in this river section since the late 1950's. Although surveys by Lyons in 2005 and 2010 and Köck  <em>et al.</em> in 2016 revealed individuals in the Río Tamazula east of  the town of Tamazula de Gordiano and in the Río Contla at Contla; there is a strong possibility that these individuals actually correspond to <em>A. tamazulae.<br/></em><br/>Water pollution caused by sewage from a sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Gordiano is thought to restrict the distribution of this subpopulation to only 25 river  kilometres along the Río Tamazula above the town and some of its affluents.",Decreasing,"<p>The Whitepatch Splitfin<em> </em>is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco, historically known from the Río La Trampa (Arroyo San José de Tule, type locality) and the Río El Terrero, both Río El Tule drainage, and from the Río Tamazula and further downstream from the upper Río Tuxpán, both names for consecutive sections of the Río Coahuayana, to approximately the town of Tuxpán. Furthermore, the distribution encompasses two affluents of the Río Tamazula: a nameless creek east of La Garita and the Río Contla. Though the Río El Tule is an affluent of the Río Naranjo (the name for the river section of the Río Coahuayana following the Río Tuxpán), the Arroyo San José de Tule and the Río Tamazula collection sites are separated by about 120 river kilometres and 40 km beeline.

A continuing habitat quality decline has been observed as a result of water pollution caused by urban, industrial  and agricultural discharges and run-off into the rivers. The Armería river is highly polluted with heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, and organic nutrients, and has undergone hydrological alterations as a result of  over-extraction of water resources for agricultural and domestic use.&#160;<br/><br/>With a best case scenario for area of occupancy (1,040 km<sup>2</sup>), extent of occurence (6,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and 10 known locations, the Bandfin Splitfin meets the threshold for Vulnerable (AOO: 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>; EOO: 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>; locations: 10), so therefore it is assessed Vulnerable.","Like all other&#160;<em>Allodontichthys</em>-species, the Bandfin Splitfin lives in clear riffles over substrates of gravel, rocks and boulders. It may occur in depths up to 1 m in pools, but generally prefers depths of less than 0.5 m. During the dry season, the currents are slight to moderate, but turbulent during the rest of the year. The only form of submersed vegetation associated with this species is green filamentous algae (Miller 2005).<br/><br/>Harro Hieronimus (1995) observed this species in March 1989 in the Río de la Lumbre near San Antonio on the border between Colima and Jalisco. He described the habitat as a narrow creek up to 1 m wide and 30 cm deep, with the ground made up of gravel, sand, rocks and silt, easily to whirl, and lots of foliage. The riverbed was shaded by large trees; the current slowly running over several steps of boulders and rocks. He found the Bandfin Splitfin hiding under rocks and boulders. Other fish species found at this site were <em>Ilyodon furcidens</em> and Guppys (<em>Poecilia reticulata</em>). The water parametres at 12:45 on March 21 were: temperature 19.5°C, conductivity 560 μS, pH 7.2, total hardness 15°dH and carbonate hardness 10°dH.","The species is mainly threatened by water pollution caused by urban, industrial and agricultural discharges and run-off into the ríos Armería and Coahuayana-basins. A recent study about the water quality of the Río Ayuquila-Tuxcacuesco-Armería system revealed mercury values above the permissible level and lead concentration close to the permissable level (Mancilla-Villa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). The whole system is heavily polluted with heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides and organic nutrients. It has also undergone hydrological alterations as a result of over-extraction of water resources for agricultural and domestic use and, as a result of it, the river is often dry at the river mouth, acting as an obstacle for migratory species (Martínez Rivera <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sugar cane production on the plain between Autlán de Navarro and El Grullo threatens the stocks in this area through pesticides and fertilisers. An additional threat for the Río Ayuquila is urban and industrial sewage from the towns of Autlán de Navarro and El Grullo, and for the ríos Colima and Salado from the towns of Colima and Cuauhtemoc.<br/><em></em>","From the affiliation to two separate river basins (Río Armería respectively Río Coahuayana), two subpopulations of the Bandfin Splitfin, (the Río Armería and the Río Salado subpopulation) can be distinguished. <br/><br/>According to the Río Armería subpopulation, stocks in the Río Ayuquila and some of its affluents recovered after the improvement of water quality from a sugar cane mill discharge near the town of Autlán, but these gains have been offset by population declines further downstream in the Río Armería and in rivers and creeks near Colima belonging to the Río Colima drainage (Lyons 2011). Furthermore, possible habitats in the upper ríos Ayuquila and Tuxcacuesco have become uninhabitable for this species due to dams (e.g. Presa las Piedras, Presa General Ramón Corona). Only one collection site above one dam, at the Arroyo San Pedro, is known. Due to its range and population declines in the lower section of the Río Armería, this subpopulation is regarded Vulnerable. <br/><br/>According to the Río Salado subpopulation, the declines observed in the Río Colima and its affluents can also be observed in this geographically close subpopulation. This subpopulation is much smaller, but includes two locations, so therefore it is regarded Endangered.",Decreasing,"The Bandfin Splitfin is endemic to the Mexican federal states of Jalisco and Colima and was originally described from the vicinity of Colima, probably from the Río Colima, Río Armería drainage. In following decades, it was also discovered in several affluents of the Río Armería and in one affluent of the Río Salado, Río Coahuayana drainage. Currently, its geographic range encompasses the Río Ayuquila (the name of the upper section of the Río Armería), the upper Río Armería to about its junction with the Río de la Lumbre (about 15km north-north-west of Colima)&#160;including the Río de la Lumbre itself, the Río Tuxcacuesco around its junction with the Río Ayuquila, one affluent in its headwaters (Arroyo San Pedro), and two main affluents of the Río Ayuquila (arroyos Ahuacapán and Manantlán), all from within the upper Río Armería drainage. It also occurs in the headwaters of the Río Colima, the Barranca de la Tía Barragana&#160;and Arroyo El Carrizal (Río Comala sources) around the town of Comala, middle Río Armería drainage.

The species prefers densely planted areas with depths of less than 30 cm. The known localities are threatened by groundwater pumping for agriculture and the increasing diving tourism in the bigger spring pools, while smaller pools are still used for recreation and agricultural purposes. A big threat occurs through non-native invasive species being introduced in the whole drainage. While the impact through cichlids (<em>Oreochromis </em>sp. and <em>Herichthys cyanoguttatus</em>) seems to be negligible due to different habitat preferences, Poeciliid species like <em>Gambusia panuco,&#160;</em><em>Poecilia </em><em>mexicana,</em> and <em>P.</em>&#160;<em>latipunctata</em>&#160;have a much greater impact due to competition for food. Especially in areas threatened by recreational activity, <em>Poecilia mexicana</em> quickly replaces <em>Ataeniobius toweri</em>. The species is categorized as Endangered (EN) based on its restricted AOO, EOO and number of locations (3), in addition to declines in habitat quality.","<em>Ataeniobius toweri</em> lives typically in quiet water with little   or no current. It can be found along shallow margins of lagoons, marshes   and ditches, but also in creeks where currents may be moderately   strong. It prefers depths to 1 m with very clear water, but can also tolerate murky water. Typical vegetation associated with the Striped Goodeid are species of <em>Nymphaea</em>, <em>Scirpus</em>, <em>Juncus,&#160;</em><em>Eichhornia </em>and green algae. The substrate is made of flocculent silt, mud, sand, gravel and rocks (Miller 2005). La Media Luna&#160;includes an area with several warm springs and is located  about 10 km southwest of the city of Río Verde. Water from two caves  forms a catchment area or reservoir that the natives call a lagoon. The  clear water smells strongly sulfurous and the temperature ranges between  26 and 30 °C (Wischnath 1993).<br/><br/>A habitat near Villa Juarez, surveyed by Köck <em>et al.</em> in 2015, is a system of channels about 250 m southeast of the El Aguaje spring (M. Köck pers. comm. 2018). The species occurs in narrow channels, about 0.5-1 m wide, under leaves of water lilies and occasionally between reed stems. It was hard to find at this locality and seemed to be rare. The ground was muddy with few rocks and roots, some patches of water lilies occurred and the water temperature was around 28 °C.","Brian Kabbes, Netherlands, visited La Media Luna in 1999 and pointed to the intensive  application of the lagoon as resort and the usage of the outflow to  water the surrounding fields. He also documented a partial destruction  of the habitat as a result of this. Palacio-Nuñez&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) pointed on a similar situation. They complained about the tourism industry destroying habitats through pollution and poor waste management. In recent years, upcoming diving tourism has lead to severe damages of submersed and riparian vegetation. Anteojitos and La Media Luna lakes are protected as reserves, but groundwater pumping in the region may reduce spring inputs into the lakes and cause introduction of  non-native species; this threatens the continued survival of <em>Ataeniobius toweri</em> (Domínguez-Domínguez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Observations by Palacio-Nuñez&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) detected a strong correlation between presence of&#160;<em>Ataeniobius toweri</em> and densely planted areas.

It hibernates in mud at the bottom of ponds and in spring-water saturated ground up to at least 75m from ponds (Briggs 1987). It prefers quiet ponds for breeding and usually lays eggs in shallow open water. Non-breeding habitats are often more than 100m from breeding sites, sometimes substantially more. Non-breeding habitats can be streams in lower altitudes. It is not clear how adaptable this species is to habitat degradation.","Observed declines in Lassen Volcanic National Park are apparently due to a combination of local factors, including (1) the presence of non-native predatory fish that have restricted available habitat and limited dispersal of frogs; (2) gradual loss of open meadows and associated aquatic habitats; and (3) loss of breeding habitat due to a five-year drought (Fellers and Drost 1993). Pesticide drift via prevailing winds might also have contributed to losses in California (Davidson, Shaffer and Jennings 2002). Introduced fish are implicated as limiting distribution in montane areas (Hayes and Jennings 1986; Jennings and Hayes 1994; Adams, Schindler and Bury 2001). UV radiation shows negative effects in experimental settings, but effects at landscape scale are unclear (Adams, Schindler and Bury 2001; Palen <em>et al.</em> 2002).

The species seems to prefer sloping banks with rocks or vegetation to the water's edge (Stebbins 1985). Zweifel (1955) observed that the frogs in southern California are typically found in steep gradient streams in the chaparral belt and may range into small meadow streams at higher elevations. In contrast, Sierran frogs are most abundant in high elevation lakes and slow-moving portions of streams. This frog seldom is found away from water, but it may cross upland areas in moving between summer and winter habitats (Matthews and Pope 1999). Wintering sites include areas nearshore under ledges and in deep underwater crevices (Matthews and Pope 1999).<br/><br/>In southern California, USFWS (2006) concluded that Rana muscosa requires the following habitat elements: (1) Water source(s) found between 1,214 to 7,546 feet (370 to 2,300 meter) in elevation that are permanent. Water sources include, but are not limited to, streams, rivers, perennial creeks (or permanent plunge pools within intermittent creeks), pools (i.e., a body of impounded water that is contained above a natural dam) and other forms of aquatic habitat. The water source should maintain a natural flow pattern including periodic natural flooding. Aquatic habitats that are used by mountain yellow-legged frog for breeding purposes must maintain water during the entire tadpole growth phase, which can last for up to 2 years. During periods of drought, or less than average rainfall, these breeding sites may not hold water long enough for individuals to complete metamorphosis, but they would still be considered essential breeding habitat in wetter years. Further, the aquatic includes: a. Bank and pool substrates consisting of varying percentages of soil or silt, sand, gravel cobble, rock, and boulders; b. Open gravel banks and rocks projecting above or just beneath the surface of the water for sunning posts; c. Aquatic refugia, including pools with bank overhangs, downfall logs or branches, and/or rocks to provide cover from predators; and d.

Human use in and along streams can disrupt the development, survivorship, and recruitment of eggs, larvae, and adult frogs (Jennings 1995; Stewart, in litt. 1995) and can change the character of a stream and its bank and associated vegetation in ways that make whole sections of a stream less suitable for the species (see USFWS 2002).

Pathogenic chytrid fungus (attacks larval mouthparts) may be a threat (USFWS 2002). Release of toxic or hazardous materials into streams is a potential threat (Jennings 1995, Backlin et al. 2002, USFS 2002).","Vredenburg et al. (cited by Macey et al. 2001) stated that there are only 3-4 healthy populations in the southern Sierra Nevada.<br/><br/>Historically, Rana muscosa was documented in approximately 166 localities in creeks and drainages in the mountains of southern California (Jennings and Hayes 1994). Currently the species is known from only seven or eight locations (Backlin et al. 2002, cited by USFWS 2002; Vredenburg et al. 2007).<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but may not exceed a couple thousand (generously assuming 20 subpopulations averaging 100 adults); available information indicates fewer subpopulations and smaller subpopulation sizes. In southern California south of the Sierra Nevada, estimated population size in 2003 was around 183 adults (see USFWS 2006).<br/><br/>A precipitous decline in Rana muscosa/Rana sierrae appears to have occurred over the past 3-4 decades (Bradford 1991; USFWS 1999; Vredenburg et al., in Lannoo 2005). For the Rana muscosa/Rana sierrae complex as a whole, Jennings and Hayes (1994) mapped many more extirpated populations than extant populations. <br/><br/>Of the 79 historical R. muscosa sites studied by Vredenburg et al. (2007), only 3 sites contained frogs when revisited between 1995 and 2005 (96 percent extirpation rate). Rana muscosa probably has been extirpated from more than 99% of the historical range in southern California south of the Sierra Nevada (USFWS 2002).<br/><br/>Declines likely are continuing, but the current rate of decline (past 10 years) is uncertain.",Decreasing,"Rana muscosa occurs in the southern Sierra Nevada of California and in mountains to the south in southern California. In southern California south of the Sierra Nevada, the historical range extended from Palomar Mountain in San Diego County northward and westward through the San Jacinto, San Bernardino, and San Gabriel Mountains of Riverside, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles counties; these formed four isolated clusters of montane populations (Vredenburg et al. 2007). Additionally, the species occurred as an isolated cluster of populations on Breckenridge Mountain, south of the Kern River in Kern County, and in the Sierra Nevada (west of the crest) in Tulare, Inyo and Fresno counties, extending north to Mather Pass (Vredenburg et al. 2007). The mountain ridges that separate the headwaters of the South Fork Kings River from the Middle Fork Kings River, from Mather Pass to the Monarch Divide, form the northern border of the range. Rana muscosa is now extirpated on Palomar and Breckenridge mountains and in much of the former range elsewhere in southern California and the southern Sierra Nevada (USFWS 2006, Vredenburg et al. 2007). Elevational range in southern California is 1,220-7,560 feet (370-2,290 meters (Stebbins 1985, USFWS 2002).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"All known populations and majority of habitat in southern California occur on lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFWS 1999, 2002). Elsewhere, most occurrences are on lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service or U.S. National Park Service. Occurrence in protected, pristine areas does not ensure population persistence, due to threats from non-native fishes and disease.<br/><br/>A total of 8,283 acres (33.5 square kilometers) of stream segments and riparian habitat in portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties have been designated as critical habitat for the southern California distinct population segment of mountain yellow-legged frog (USFWS 2006).

It moves further from watercourses during the rainy season. It presumably breeds in streams, though there is a record of tadpoles being found in a water tank.<br/><br/>Its generation length is estimated to be three years.","A retrospective study analysing amphibian population declines (between 2004-2012) confirms the emergence of Bd in 2008 on Mount Oku and in 2011 on Manengouba, suggesting that chytridiomycosis has driven community level declines of anuran biodiversity in this hotspot area (Hirschfeld <em>et al</em>. 2016). Although this species tested negative for <em>Bd</em> (Hirschfeld <em>et al.</em> 2016), the declines observed are characteristic of observed declines in other montane amphibians in other regions caused by chytridiomycosis. Stresses such as habitat loss are suspected to make amphibian species more susceptible to declines caused by chytridiomycosis (M.-O. Rödel pers. comm. July 2016). It would appear that the subpopulations on Manengouba and Nlonako have already been severely hit by the disease, which is likely to spread to other subpopulations.<br/><br/>There is also increasing habitat loss as a result of agricultural  encroachment, including plantations of tree crops; expanding human  settlements; and removal of wood by local people for firewood and  building materials. <br/><br/>On Mount Manengouba, an additional threat includes the use of herbicides and pesticides, which is suspected to have long-term effects on the stream habitat, affecting the larval stage, and this threat is expected to increase as human activity in the area increases. Deforestation on Mount Manengouba also occurs due to the unsustainable collection of bark from <em>Prunus africanus</em> - a high-elevation tree endemic to the Cameroon highlands - by the method of tree ringing. The tree's bark is used in small amounts for medicinal purposes by local people. However, it is also sold to pharmaceutical companies in large amounts, in which case all the bark is removed from the individual trees, resulting in their death. The consequence of the latter practice changes the microclimate required for the species' survival. Furthermore, as with other high-elevation species, the species' habitat may be adversely affected by climate change (N. Gonwouo pers. comm. May 2012).<br/><br/>On Bioko Island, ongoing threats include the encroachment of farmland, which is ongoing  near Moka, while road construction is fragmenting habitat and is occurring within the island's National Parks (P. McLaughlin pers. comm. March  2013).","It was recorded on Bioko Island during surveys in 2011 (R. Bell pers. comm. June 2012), but is considered to be generally uncommon. Prior to 2012, this species was found easily on Mount Manengouba, however surveys in 2012 failed to record it (M.-O. Rödel pers. comm. December 2018). One individual was found on Mount Nlonako in 2017 after ten nights of survey effort, but no individuals of this species were found in 2018 after fifteen nights surveying by three people (T. Doherty-Bone pers. comm. December 2018). Surveys in 2015 and 2016 (for two nights on both occasions) failed to record this species on Mount Kupe however,&#160;after seven nights of surveying, one individual was found at this locality in 2017 (T. Doherty-Bone pers. comm. December 2018). There have not been enough surveys conducted throughout this species habitat to estimate a past population decline, however the decline in this species is characteristic of observed declines in other montane amphibians in other regions caused by chytridiomycosis. The declines observed in Cameroon are expected to occur more widely within the species range, and it is not unrealistic to estimate that this species will decline by 80% within the next 10 years (which is longer than three generation lengths).<br/><br/>This species is considered to be severely fragmented because the entire population is found in isolated and fragmented habitat patches, which are increasingly fragmented by human activities, and these fragments are separated by large extents of unsuitable habitat thereby restricting its dispersal<em>. </em>Due to ongoing decline in the extent and quality of habitat, the population is suspected to be decreasing.<strong></strong>",Decreasing,"This species is known from eastern Nigeria on the Obudu Plateau and the higher parts of the Oban Hills, and from a number of montane localities in western Cameroon, including Mount Cameroon, the Rumpi Hills, Mount Kupe, Mount Manengouba, Mount Nlonako (Herrmann <em>et al.</em> 2005), the Mbos Cliffs, and Foto. It is also known from Mount Kala and Mount Mbam-Minkoum near Yaoundé in southern Cameroon. Mertens (1965) implied that it was likely that this species would be  recorded on Bioko and rightly so: the Bioko Biodiversity Protection  Project of Drexel University recorded this species on Bioko in 2008 near  Moka (J. Weinberg, Bioko Biodiversity Protection Project unpublished  report, 2008) and it continues to be recorded in the vicinity of the town of Moka (R. Bell and P.J. McLaughlin pers. comm. July 2012).

Unfortunately, it seems there is no real enforcement of, or within, the  borders Bioko's Protected Areas. Generally speaking there is  concern that recent political rearrangements and conflicting laws being  passed may have compromised the existence of Bioko's parks, possibly  even terminating them; thus making protected areas on Bioko Island no  real asset to the species' conservation (P. McLaughlin pers. comm. March  2013).&#160;<br/><br/><strong><em>Conservation Needed</em></strong><br/>There is an urgent need for an expanded protected area network in western Cameroon, which should include all remaining montane forest habitat, particularly those on Mount Manengouba, which has been proposed as a protected area (N.

However, in light of the presence of <em>Bd</em> in this region and the population declines associated with it, the most important conservation action remains the protection of habitat from destruction and degredation to prevent increased susceptibility of the species to infection  (M.-O.

The species is not restricted to primary forests, being well able to live in modified/disturbed environments such as secondary forests, relying only on sufficient year round available resources, such as tree holes to be used as sleeping sites, and fruit trees or foraging sites (Coimbra-Filho 1969, 1976a; Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1973). Because they have long, slender fingers and modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, they are allowed to forage for prey efficiently in nooks and crannies and in epiphytic tank bromeliads (Coimbra-Filho 1970a). They are considered generalists and their diet is mainly composed by fruits, plant exudates, and small live prey, such as amphibians, lizards, birds, invertebrates and other animals (Passos 1999, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015). Commonly, within their faeces undigested seeds are found. Such seeds were proved to be viable after passing through their digestive system, characterizing them as good seed dispersers as they walk long distances—between 1 and 3 km during a day (Passos 1997b, Medici 2001). For this reason, the species is important for the maintenance of the ecosystem services of their habitat. The group home range can vary significantly, from 40 ha to almost 400 ha (Albernaz 1997, Mamede-Costa 1997, Medici 2001, Passos 1997a, Valladares-Padua 1993). It can be influenced by several factors, such as seasonal variation of resources within the same area or difference in availability of resources among different areas. It shows the importance of studying home range in each fragment that the tamarins occur, to have a better estimation of population size and the fragment’s carrying capacity. Such data can be useful for designing population management strategies.&#160;Coimbra-Filho (1970a,b, 1976a; Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1977) and Martins (2003) studied their behaviour in the wild, and Valladares-Padua (1993) provides a comprehensive review of the ecology, diet and behaviour of the black lion tamarins. The species lives in extended family groups whose size varies from 2 to 8 individuals, but on average it is 3 to 4 (Coimbra-Filho 1976a, Carvalho and Carvalho 1989). Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. They breed once a year, the pregnancy lasts between 125 and 132 days and the females usually give birth to twins.","The principal threat to<em> Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em> stems from severe habitat loss that occurred throughout its range in past decades, and which has resulted in fragmented forests and isolated sub-populations, many of which are not considered viable over the long-term (Holst <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the state of São Paulo only 6.4% (about 5,000 km²) of the Black Lion Tamarin’s tropical semi-deciduous forest habitat remains, and the species actually occurs in less than 10% of that area (490 km²) as small, scattered and isolated sub-populations (Garbino <em>et&#160; al</em>. 2016). Each forest fragment is surrounded by cattle farms and/or eucalyptus, sugar cane and coffee plantations.&#160; Ongoing threats include fire, the establishment of rural settlements, agricultural expansion, road kill and the recent emergency of yellow fever in southern regions of Brazil (Bicca-Marques <em>et al.</em> 2017, Garcia 2018). Reduced population size and deforestation in some fragments may be the cause of recent local extinctions that have been reported (Garbino <em>et al</em>. 2016). According to some scenarios, climate change may also represent a future threat by affecting the extent and/or suitability of available habitat (Meyer<em> et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Leontopithecus chrysopygus</em> is now known to survive in 15 localities in the state of São Paulo. However, only the subpopulation of the Morro do Diabo State Park can be considered both demographically and genetically viable in the long term. The minimum viable population estimated for the species is more than 750 individuals in a single population to meet the management goal of at least 98% chance of persistence and 98% retention of gene diversity (Holst <em>et al</em>. 2006). The population of Morro do Diabo is estimated at approximately 1,200 animals (Paranhos 2006), living in 33,845 ha of forest. The other known subpopulations, except for the recently discovered in Carlos Botelho State Park, occupy fragments smaller than 2,300 ha (most of them between 400 and 600 ha), which can harbour populations not larger than 80 animals (24 individuals on average) and are certainly too small to be viable in the mid- to long-term. The total population size is estimated at about 1,600 animals and it is inferred that the number of mature individuals is higher than 250.<br/><br/>Habitat loss continues within the Black Lion Tamarin's range and could reach between 10-15% by 2040; several of the subpopulations (representing 20% of the total population) are considered non-viable over the mid-to-long term and could be extirpated by the middle of this century, and the potential mortality due to a yellow fever outbreak could be significant, as appears to have been the case recently with <em>L. rosalia</em>.",Decreasing,"The Black Lion Tamarin is endemic to Brazil, occurring only in the Atlantic Forest of the state of São Paulo (Kierulff <em>et al.</em> 2008). Unlike the other three species of this genus, all of which reach the Atlantic coast, it is restricted to inland. It formerly occurred along the north (right) bank of the Paranapanema River, west as far as the Paraná River, and between the upper Paranapanema and Tietê (left bank) rivers in the state of São Paulo (Coimbra-Filho 1976a,b; Hershkovitz 1977). Its distribution boundaries to the east are probably altitude-limited by the higher peaks of Serra de Paranapiacaba, a large mountain range of forest remnant in which the Back Lion Tamarin’s distribution remains unknown. Nowadays, it is known from only 15 widely separated forest patches covering about 490 km², all of them within the area belonging to the Rio Paranapanema’s watershed, indicating that the current distribution of the taxon is reduced relative to its historical extent of occurrence. The black lion tamarin currently occurs in eight protected areas throughout its distribution range. In the southeast part of the state it occurs mainly in non-protected patches of gallery forest in the municipalities of Buri, Guareí and Itapeva (Lima<em> et al.</em> 2003). The recent record of the species in the Carlos Botelho State Park (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2014), confirming its presence further south in the Serra de Paranapiacaba, could mean an improvement in its demographic situation, signalling potential changes in its future conservation status. On the other hand, it points to the need of obtaining more information about this population and along the length of this mountain chain within the neighbouring protected areas. Valladares-Padua and Martins (2008) also stress the importance of further investigation in the southeastern region of the state, including population estimates. A new population assessment covering the different areas of occupancy in all its geographic range is a priority. As well as other species of <em>Leontopithecus</em>, <em>L</em>. <em>chrysopygus </em>are very difficult to monitor and easily escape the eyes of researchers and therefore the use of radio telemetry is indispensable in studies with these species.",,Terrestrial,"The isolation and the small size of existing populations are being addressed through metapopulation management, that is, the joint management of all known populations, together with the captive population treated as a single core-population (Kierulff&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). In addition to this management program (via translocations and reintroductions), current efforts are focused on research about home range, health and genetics of the in situ populations (Valladares-Padua<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2000a, Valladares-Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002a), environmental education (Padua and Valladares-Padua 1997, Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002), creation of protected areas in remaining forest fragments (with and without tamarins), and the planting of forest corridors reconnecting fragments and establishing larger areas of continuous forest that can harbor viable populations of&#160;<em>L. chrysopygus </em>(Padua and Valladares-Padua 1997; Valladares-Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000a,b; Cullen Jr.<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2001; Valladares-Padua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002b).<br/><br/>There is a captive breeding program going on, although it was not as successful as those of&#160;<em>L. rosalia</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>L. chrysomelas</em>, probably because of the very small founder stock, formed by individuals from the Morro do Diabo State Park in the 1970s and later in 1983-1985 as part of the rescue operation in the inundation area of the Rosana hydroelectric dam (Ballou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Rylands<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2002).

Trend is unknown, but the population probably is not undergoing a continuing decline.","Habitat consists of springs and outflow streams with clear, clean water; this species prefers areas with dense aquatic vegetation (e.g.&#160;<em>Ceratophyllum</em>) and nearly constant temperatures throughout the year (USFWS 1982, Page and Burr 2011).","USFWS (2010) summarized threats as follows:<br/><br/>The primary threats are: (1) habitat loss from the potential loss of spring flow due to a decline in groundwater levels, and (2) hybridization or competition with Western Mosquitofish initially due to the local habitat modifications, but now caused by the failure of the upper dam to maintain a barrier between spring outflow and downstream habitats. Available information does not indicate that impacts to spring flows from significant increase in groundwater use or declines in recharge is imminent (defined as likely to occur in the next 10 years) at this time. However, it is likely to occur over the foreseeable future of 50 to 100 years as a result of climate change and the increasing human need for more water resources. The magnitude of impact on the Clear Creek Gambusia if this threat were realized is extremely high. Because the range of the species is limited to one small, isolated location, habitat modification due to a decline in spring flows could result in its extinction. The threats associated with hybridization and competition may be occurring now due to the recent erosion of the upper dam allowing renewed access to the upper spring pool by Western Mosquitofish. If the impacts of these threats are the same as observed in the past between 1953 and 1978, then the population of Clear Creek Gambusia will be depressed, but not eradicated until the upper dam can be repaired. Therefore, the magnitude of the impact of this threat on the species is considered moderate to high. Secondary threats include habitat modification from water quality degradation, local habitat changes, lack of regulatory mechanisms, and introduction of a disease, parasite, or nonnative species (resulting in  competition or predation). None of these concerns acting alone result in substantial threats to the species, but together any of these could negatively impact the Clear Creek Gambusia. Climate change is another source of potential threats to the species. All possible impacts associated with future climate change cannot presently be reliably predicted. However, accelerating climate change will exacerbate any of the threats already considered or could result in whole new threats that are not conceived at this time. Either way, subtle but significant changes in the ecosystem of the Clear Creek Gambusia resulting from climate change in the foreseeable future of 50 to 100 years could cause the species extinction and is a threat of high magnitude. All of these threats, both primary and secondary, must be considered in the context of a fish with an extremely small range with no opportunity for movement, a relatively small population size, and a very short life span. Because of these factors, the magnitude of impact of any potential threat or future stochastic event is exceptionally high. Any events negatively affecting the species or its habitat could result in complete extinction of the Clear Creek Gambusia.","This species is represented by one occurrence.<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but presumably exceeds 1,000.<br/><br/>Historically, the area of occupancy likely was larger but declined after the habitat was modified.<br/><br/>Trend over the past 10 years or three generations is uncertain but likely relatively stable.

High salinities in gypsum sinkholes have precluded the success of most stockings in those habitats (Hendrickson and Brooks 1991). This fish is not tolerant of total hardness above 5000 mg/l CaCO<sub>3</sub> (Bednarz 1979). Consistent habitat factors seem to be clear, clean water, stable flows, and fairly constant temperatures (Matthews and Moseley 1990). Abundance tends to be highest near spring sources (Minckley <em>et al</em>. 1991). Submerged cliffs and debris and aquatic vegetation are used for cover (Bednarz 1979).","The most pervasive threat is drying of springs due to lowering water tables (e.g., via groundwater pumping, which eliminated populations at Comanche and Tunis springs in western Texas, and which probably will occur at other sites in the near future) (Echelle <em>et al</em>. 1989). Other threats include predation by introduced fishes (especially in sites lacking aquatic vegetation or shallow water), and competition and possibly hybridization with other <em>Gambusia </em>species. A renovation of Diamond Y Draw in 1998 removed <em>Gambusia geiseri</em> from that system (Hubbs <em>et al</em>. 2002). So far, hybridization has not had a significant impact. Introduced fishes (Green Sunfish) eliminated one transplanted population in Lake St. Francis and perhaps elsewhere on the Bitter Lakes NWR (Minckley <em>et al</em>. 1991). Alterations in the natural flow and physical conditions of the Pecos River have interfered with or eliminated movements of <em>Gambusia </em>among now isolated suitable habitats, which as a result cannot be naturally recolonized should local extinctions occur during drought years.<br/><br/>Jelks <em>et al</em>.

Twelve populations are extant in the vicinity of Roswell; of these, natural populations are in two isolated gypsum sinkholes along with Sago and Dragonfly springs and their outflows, which combine to form the perennial portion of the Lost River (Bitter Creek drainage), all in Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge; other populations in the refuge are the result (in whole or in part) of introductions. An additional natural population occurs in Blue Spring, Eddy County, New Mexico. The species has been introduced in various areas of Salt Creek Wilderness Area and in artificial ponds at Living Desert State Park near Carlsbad, New Mexico. See Sublette <em>et al</em>. (1990).<br/><br/>In Texas, this species inhabits the headwaters of Phantom Lake (Jeff Davis County); San Solomon, Giffin, and East Sandia springs (Reeves County); and Diamond Y Draw and Diamond Y Springs (Pecos County) (Hubbs <em>et al</em>. 2008).

In Virginia and eastern Tennessee, it is associated with moderate and swift riffles and runs with mixed small gravel to medium rubble substrates (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). Channel Darters may overwinter in quiet pools or backwaters. Spawning generally occurs over gravel, rubble, or rock-strewn bedrock in moderate or swift current. In the northeastern part of the range, this species also occurs and spawns along lake shores. See Suttkus <em>et al</em>.

These factors have fragmented populations and reduced the likelihood of recovery (Suttkus <em>et al</em>. 1994).

Areas occupied by isolated populations are unlikely to be recolonized should local extirpation occur. <br/><br/>Low oxygen levels in Lake Erie during the late 1950s and early 1960s, coupled with silt and pollutant loads in streams, caused a decline in Ohio.<br/><br/>A large population was present in the Ohio River before impoundments were built, but now only a small population, probably declining, remains (Trautman 1981). <br/><br/>In Michigan (Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay), the minimally disturbed areas with remaining populations (AuSable and Pine rivers) presently have few of the required clean gravel beaches. Other areas in Michigan that have been severely altered (Huron and Cass rivers) no longer contain channel darter populations (Evers 1990). <br/><br/>Potential causes of decline along northern Lake Erie include eutrophication-induced ecosystem changes, the effect of extensive shoreline modification on beaches, and the invasive Round Goby (<em>Neogobius melanostomus</em>) (Reid and Mandrak 2008).","This species is represented by a large number of occurrence (subpopulations (See map in Page 1983)).

They spend almost their entire lives underground, only very occasionally coming to the surface, and only remaining on the surface for a short time. Most specimens and sightings come from animals found on the surface. However, it appears they rarely come to the surface, which makes them less prone to predation by Red Foxes, Cats and other predators.<br/><br/>When underground, marsupial moles virtually swim through the soil. The sand is packed in behind the animal as it progresses and no empty tunnel is formed. Nevertheless, where one has passed through a soil profile, an oval shaped differentiation in soil texture and colour can be seen (Johnson and Walton 1989). Where Itjaritjari are known to occur, their underground backfilled tunnels are often very common and these may represent an important source of soil disturbance (biopedturbation) (Whitford and Kay 1999). Evidence of 30-60 kilometres of backfilled tunnel per hectare is usual in these areas (Benshemesh 2004), representing about 40-80 m<sup>3</sup> of turned-over soil per hectare, or up to 1% of the soil within one metre of the surface.<br/><br/>Itjaritjari are insectivorous, capturing their prey while underground. Examination of gut contents of preserved specimens and of the habitat they occupy, has revealed a generalist diet comprising two main prey types: social insects (ants and termites) and the larvae of beetles. Ants, termites and beetle larvae were also the main invertebrates captured in soil cores on sandridges; other invertebrates combined contributed &lt;5% to abundance (Pavey <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that marsupial moles may be common prey items of larger mammalian predators. Paltridge (1998) found remains of marsupial moles in predator scats at five of her six study sites in the Tanami Desert. Her study revealed that 10% of Red Fox scats, 3% of Cat scats and 5% of Dingo scats contained signs of moles (n= 82, 111 and 59 respectively). Signs of marsupial moles have also been found in Red Fox and Dingo scats from the Anangu-Pitjantjatjara / Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia (Benshemesh 2004), and in other areas of the Northern Territory (Paltridge 1998), although not as frequently. Benshemesh <em>et al</em>. (2010) examined nearly 1800 predator scats from both southern and northern dunefields and found little difference between the likelihood of finding marsupial mole signs in scats of Red Foxes, cats and Dingoes, but major differences between northern and southern areas. In southern areas inhabited by Itjaritjari, only 1% of predator scats contained traces of marsupial moles, compared with 8% in northern areas largely inhabited by Kakarratul, a difference they attributed to the higher abundance of marsupial moles in the north and shallower burrowing habits. It is uncertain whether these predators take marsupial moles on the surface or dig them up, or indeed whether they are actually killing moles or taking dead animals. Dead or severely debilitated moles have been recorded on the surface on several occasions (Benshemesh 2004), but it seems most likely that these predators prey upon living moles that are on or just under the surface. R. T. Maurice, who travelled widely in the Great Victoria Desert between 1897 and 1903, reported that local Aboriginal people were able to capture Itjaritjari after hearing them when they were under the surface (Gara 1996 cited in Benshemesh 2004), and larger mammalian predators may do likewise. Benshemesh <em>et al</em>. (2010) found some evidence that Dingoes, at least, hunted marsupial moles in northern areas, where it was common to find the remains of more than one marsupial mole in each scat. On the surface, marsupial moles are vulnerable to a wide range of predators including birds of prey, snakes and goannas.<br/><br/>A study of the metabolic physiology of a single Kakarratul concluded that it differs in some aspects of thermal and metabolic physiology from other marsupials, most likely reflecting its almost completely fossorial existence (Withers <em>et al</em>. 2000). Itjaritjari are likely to be similar.</p>","While several possible threats have been identified (predation by introduced species, inappropriate fire regimes), recent data suggests Itjaritjari remain widespread and relatively abundant.","<p>There is no robust estimate of population size, nor any data that suggest decline. However, evidence can be found in most areas of suitable habitat (stable dunes) within the species’ distribution. Indices of levels of activity have been developed, but these are not yet correlated with abundance.</p>",Stable,Itjaritjari (Southern Marsupial Mole) occur in the Great Victoria Deserts of Western Australia and South Australia and the western half of the Simpson Desert in southern Northern Territory and Queensland. Their distribution follows that of the sand dune habitat that they prefer.

In the completely snowed in valleys of the Himalaya, however, ibex remain in high elevations during winter to feed on emergent vegetation in the avalanche chutes and windblown crests, and also digging through softer snow of the higher elevations. They descend to the lower valley bottoms to take advantage of the spring thaw, but ascend to the highest ridgelines during the peak of summer (Schaller 1977, Bhatnagar 1997). Ibex occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. Siberian Ibex&#160;can also be found in areas with canyons, rocky outcrops, and steep ‘escape’ terrain far from high mountains (Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007, Peterson 2016, Bragin <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species rarely enters forest zones, but on a hot day does prefer shaded areas, or even small pockets of pastures near glaciers.

In the Pin Valley National Park in India, over 90% of the over 800 ibex sightings were within 100 m from ‘escape terrain’ (Bhatnagar 1997). Females tend to retreat into the security of cliffs for parturition in May-June (Schaller 1977). </p>  <p>Ibex live in small groups that vary considerably in size, sometimes forming herds of over 100 animals, but more typically averaging 6-30 animals, depending on the region (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1997, 1999b; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Singh <em>et al. </em>2010). They spend the day in alternating periods of activity and rest, having a bimodal pattern through much of the year. In winter, ibex in the Himalaya tend to have a distinct unimodal activity peak towards noon, while resting on or near cliffs from evening until the next morning (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1992, Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). </p>  <p>Ibex shows little sexual segregation throughout the year, except the period between parturition (around June) and autumn (November) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex in an area of rocky outcrops in the Mongolian Gobi Desert displayed no segregation between sexes and similar sized mean annual home ranges using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) of 42 km<sup>2</sup> for females (n = 5) and 39 km<sup>2</sup> for males (n = 4) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study on ranging patterns of ibex in the Indian Himalaya (2 adult males and 3 females) shows that the mean annual home range (MCPs) of males (44 km<sup>2</sup>) was almost double that of females (20 km<sup>2</sup>) (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex used extremely small ranges on lower, south facing slopes with early sprout during the spring (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>), expanding to larger ranges in summer and autumn, but again confining to small ranges during winter (5-10 km<sup>2</sup>). Daily movements of ibex were highest during the summer flush when they traversed over a km during a day to take advantage of forage quality, but were confined to barely a 300-400 meters during winter and spring due to limited usable patches (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015).</p>  <p>Ibex are primarily grazers with herbs as well as subshrubs and shrubs such as <em>Eurotia sp</em>., <em>Rosa</em> sp. and <em>Ephedra sp.</em> contributing significantly to their diet (Manjrekar 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Bagchi <em>et al. </em>2004, Tumursukh 2015). </p>  <p>Females gestate for 170-180 days (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961) and usually give birth to one, sometimes two, kids in the spring. The animals reach sexual maturity at 18 months for females and 30 months for males, although usually only older males mate (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Siberian Ibex&#160;can live up to 16-17 years (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961, Fedosenko and Blank 2001).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Throughout its range, local people hunt ibex for subsistence use because they traditionally provide an important supplementary food for local people. Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations.<br/> <br/> In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted <em>Capra sibirica</em>. (Some hair fibers from <em>C. sibirica</em> are quite fine, and potentially may be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, specialty scarves. As of this writing (early 2020), the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from <em>C. sibirica</em>) had not yet been determined, but were still being advertised on the internet as coming from ibex, stating that annually 1500 kg of the wool are produced world-wide (www.acitac.com/materialien/faserkunde/yangir.html). This would require the harvest of a considerable number of animals. Domestic hunting might provide the raw material. Trophy hunting programs harvest only a few animals/year and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially marketed wool product. However, so far interest in ibex wool at local level is unknown and it seems Central Asia is not (yet) a supplier (Michel unpubl. data). If <em>Capra sibirica</em> were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened.<br/> <br/> In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Siberian Ibex&#160;are harvested in trophy hunting programs. Trophy hunting targets only males above a certain age, and so direct impacts on targeted population size likely remain negligible, but poorly regulated trophy hunting can have many negative consequences (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), including an effect on the sex and age composition of populations as reported from Kyrgyzstan (Michel and Rosen 2016). The potential of causing evolutionary effects is low as long as hunter harvest only a minor portion of the males. Bans on trophy hunting and importation of hunting trophies risk removing incentives to prevent poaching and might increase human-caused mortality of ibex.<br/> <br/> Climate change likely poses new threats by altering habitat quality, in particular affecting water availability, vegetation composition and phenology as well as causing changes in land-use. <br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, it seems that prior to the Soviet invasion, Siberian Ibex&#160;was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited, in some areas due to customary regulations (Michel unpubl. data, based information from traditional hunters 2009). Currently hunting is formally banned, but poaching is still a major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency, in particular where military personnel and other armed forces are involved. Poaching became of greater concern in Wakhan National Park (i.e. the district of Wakhan), where border guards and police presence has increased (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2019). <br/> <br/> In China, the species is classified as a Category I Protected Wild Animal Species under the Wild Animal Protection Law (Wang 1998). Poaching might now pose a minor threat, as the government has confiscated most guns from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.<br/> <br/> In India, region-wide threat assessments are scarce. Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2015) report illegal hunting by migratory laborers and migratory herders as one of the most important threats across the state of Himachal Pradesh, followed by subsistence hunting by local people and competition with migratory livestock for fodder. Increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993). Livestock grazing may not necessarily indicate competition, as was evident from summer grazing by local herders in Pin Valley; however, large herds of migratory herders were certainly a threat (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2000, Bagchi <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004). The fact that ibex can utilize rugged habitats have probably allowed them to linger precariously in parts of Himachal Pradesh with heavy grazing by migratory herds of livestock (Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>2015). The level of poaching is extremely low in the Buddhist dominated areas of India (Spiti and Ladakh). Heavy military presence along the disputed border between India and Pakistan can cause considerable disturbance to the species on both sides of the border, including the presence of border fencing. In fact, the ‘highest battlefield in the world’ around the Siachen glacier, contested between India and Pakistan, is surrounded by prime ibex habitat of the Karakorum, but is subjected to considerable military activity.</p>  <p>In Pakistan, poaching for food, heavy military presence on the Indian and Afghanistan borders, and competition for food with livestock are threats to Siberian Ibex. <br/> <br/> In Mongolia, transformation of ibex habitat for mining might be one of the most important emerging threats to the conservation of this species (see Tumursukh <em>et al.</em> 2015). The impact of trophy hunting on ibex populations remains uncertain (Lkhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other important threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali (<em>Ovis ammon</em>) by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively affect the species (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). A recent study by Odonjavkhlan (2018) did not find evidence for an impact of livestock grazing on habitat use by ibex in Tost Tosunbumba Nature Reserve. Tumursukh (2013) found evidence for competition between ibex and goats/sheep for forage; however, he did not find any evidence for demographic impacts from this competition. Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation. Harsh winter weather conditions can also severely affect population sizes locally (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is hunted by local people based on permit systems, but with a large unreported and illegal take. Informal hunting still seems to exceed official quotas in these countries, although the quotas for domestic hunters have not always appeared sustainable. Kyrgyzstan since 2017 has applied temporary hunting moratoria in several provinces, the effect of which is not yet evident.<br/> <br/> In Russia, although hunted legally under license, many are shot illegally and in large numbers.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>No rigorously derived population estimates exist for Siberian Ibex&#160;in any range state, although Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Lkhagvasuren <em>et al. </em>(2016) provide population estimates for most of Mongolia in 2009. Thus, the total population number provided here is a rough guess. Summarizing all available guestimates for the range states the total population size likely would be in the range of 170,000 to 250,000 animals (102,000 to 150,000 mature individuals).<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, the Siberian Ibex&#160;was considered abundant throughout its range prior to the late 1970s and a series of wars. Shank <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1977) estimated that around 5,000 animals used the Ajar Valley Reserve seasonally during the 1970s; this population is likely much smaller now (C. Shank pers. comm. 2007). More than 4,000 were believed to inhabit the Pamir alone. Their present status in the Pamir is unknown, but they are known to persist in reasonably large numbers throughout the ranges of the Wakhan Corridor. There in 2011 WCS recorded 2,069 animals in a direct count (1.6 per km²); in 2015, the double observer method yielded an estimate of 740 ±226 (2.2 per km²) (Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017)<span lang=""EN-US""> and 753 ±267 (2.2 per km²) in 2018 (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2020). The Siberian Ibex&#160;occurs along the Panj River across most of Badakhshan Province, but in some districts is exposed to illegal overhunting and population numbers are unknown (Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> There is no overall population estimate in China. The population in the Tian Shan had been guessed at 40,000-50,000 individuals (Wang 1998). Wu <em>et al. </em>(2015) estimate a density of 1.54 (± 0.23) per km² in the Tien Shan mountains south of Urumqi. Densities in other areas are relatively low. Rough guesses of ibex numbers in the Bei Mountains (northern Gansu) are between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals. The species has almost disappeared in the Daqin Mountains (Gao <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is listed as “Endangered” in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals (Wang 1998).<br/> <br/> In India, earlier population estimates include a minimum of 6,000 in Ladakh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1991a) and perhaps another 4,000 on the south side of the main Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and in the Pir Panjal range of Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1992). A total of up to 15,000 ibex was estimated by Johnsingh, Mishra and Bhatnagar (1997) in <em>ca</em> 40,000 km² of potential habitat based on rough extrapolations. Counts of ibex in protected areas include 330 in the Kanji-Boodkharbu, 225 in Lungnag, 250 in Rangdum, and 174 in Rizong Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir) (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a), and 174 in the Pin Valley National Park (Himachal Pradesh) where Pandey (1993) estimated a density of 2.3 ibex/km² in 1989 and Johnsingh <em>et al.</em> (1997) at a lower value of 1.2 ibex/km². More recently Suryawanshi <em>et al.</em> (2012) estimate a density of 0.37 ibex/km² or 184 (± 40) ibex in 497 km² in Pin Valley National Park; a density of 0.11 ibex/km or 45 (±13) in 411 km² of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary and a density of 0.14 ibex/km² or 30 (±14) in 219 km² of Lossar area of Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Over the past 10 years, these populations have been monitored using similar protocol and the population trends are stable (Suryawanshi, unpublished data). A recent occupancy survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2017) across the state of Himachal Pradesh found that ibex occupy an estimated 8,915 km². They found no evidence of range expansion or contraction in the Himachal Pradesh region between 1992 and 2015. Given these figures, we suspect that total population might not be more than 15,000.<br/> <br/> As reported by Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997), the total number of ibex in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia (as well as in adjacent Russia) was estimated at between 100,000 to 110,000 animals. Most of these occurred in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (<em>ca</em> 70,000) and Kazakhstan (ca. 17,000) with far fewer (8,000 to 9,000) in southern Siberia (3,000 to 3,500 in the Altai, 2,500 in Tannu Ola mountains of Tuva, 1,500 in Western Sayan and 2,000 to 2,500 in Eastern Sayan) and Uzbekistan (2,400). In Kazakhstan, the official numbers reported by the Provincial Territorial Inspection Services for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture (A. Muzbay pers. comm. 2019) during the period 2014-2018 varied between 16,582 and 22,700 (average 20,500). These variations may reflect differences in reporting or methods rather than actual fluctuations of the population size. In Kyrgyzstan, officially reported numbers for the years 2000 – 2013 vary between 34,000 in 2009 and 73,000 in 2000, and are not always fully consistent (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019); the most recent official figure was 41,463 in 2018 (Press Service of the State Agency on Forestry and Environmental Protection, 2019 quoted at https://eco.akipress.org/news:1562027). The abundance varies. There are hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Ala-Arch National Park and Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) with high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low. The population size in the Pamirs and Pamiro-Alay in Tajikistan are unknown, but the species was considered common, especially in the western part of the Pamirs (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers had declined during and after the civil war in Tajikistan in the 1990s and recovered only locally. The total potentially suitable area in Tajikistan is approx. 70,000 km²; if applying the lower density margin (0.2/km²) from the site estimates below the total ibex population size might be 14,000 animals (own guess Michel, 2019). Considering that large areas are intensively used for grazing and poaching impact has reduced population sizes, this figure might be more realistic than higher estimates of up to 25,000 (Kh. Karimov pers. comm. 2019). In Uzbekistan, the population might still be in the range of 2,000-2,500 animals, although the southern part of the Hissar Range in Surkhandarya Province has not been surveyed for the last two decades (E. Bykova pers. comm. 2019). Thus, despite local declines the overall population size seems to be still similar as reported in Shackleton (1997) with no detectable overall trend, but possibly declines at least in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, it is not clear if this apparently stable or slightly declining population size reflects the real situation or continuity in formal reporting by state agencies and hunting organizations. The continuing prevalence of poaching across Central Asia combined with an increase in the intensity and area covered by livestock grazing in mountainous rangelands over the last two decades leads us to suspect an overall more substantial decline in population size than reflected in official numbers. This suspected decline is also supported by site-level estimates in areas with different management regimes </p>  <p>Few site level estimates exist for the Central Asia region. Jumabay-Uulu (2013) estimated a density of 0.67 ibex/km² in 1,341 km² of Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan. Recent surveys (2018) by Khanyari (unpublished data) using the double-observer survey method put the estimates in this area at 2.26 ibex/km². Numbers in community-based conservancies in the Bartang valley, Wakhan and Northern Alichur range of Tajikistan have been stable or increasing between 2009 and 2019 with densities varying between 0.19 and 1.42 animals per km² conservancy area and an absolute number of up to 2,300 over an area of 2,250 km² (unpublished data of ANCOT, 2019). Michel and Muratov (2010) reported direct counts of 2,476 animals in 8,174 km² surveyed area of the eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan (0.30 ibex per km² surveyed area with substantial variation between areas). Point counts in two sections of this area in 2013 yielded estimates of 0.34 animals per km² in an unmanaged area and 0.57 animals per km² in a game management area (unpublished analysis of data of ANCOT by Michel).&#160; <br/> <br/> The Mongolian Red Data Book 1987 (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987), stated that 1,000 individuals inhabited western Khövsgöl alone, and a total of 80,000 animals occurred in Mongolia in the mid-1980s (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) stated that ibex numbers declined since that peak estimate of 80,000 due to exploitation, habitat degradation and competition for resources (Schaller 1994, 1995, 1998). Lkhagvasuren et al. (2016) estimated a total of 36,018 (13,840–43,873) ibex across Mongolia. This is much lower than the 80,000 ibex estimated in mid-1980s. In the Khohk Serkh Reserve in the High Altai, the population was estimated at 1,000 in 1979 by Dzieciolowski <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1980) and at 1,200 by des Clers (1985). Tulgat and Schaller (1992) estimated 600 ibex in the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area. In 1989, in a 200 km² study area west of Tsogt in the Altai, Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1994) counted 337 ibex, and estimated there may have been a total of up to 450 animals. Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) recorded 1,218 ibex in 623 km² of Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Conservation Park (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999b). Tumursukh <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate a density of 0.75 ibex/km² or 1,051 (±196) in 1,400 km² of the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, which were later declared Tost-Tosumbumba Nature Reserve. Few other rigorously derived estimates of population numbers exist for other parts of Mongolia. <br/> <br/> Siberian Ibex&#160;is widely distributed over northern Pakistan, but is only locally abundant in the northern part of the country. Hess (1986) found the highest density in northern Pakistan to be in the area along the Barpu Glacier (Gilgit District) with 1.2 to 1.6 animals/km² (n = 194-270 animals, area surveyed = 164 km<sup>2</sup>). Wegge (1988) estimated that &gt;2,000 ibex lived in the Khunjerab NP, at a slightly lower density of <em>ca</em> 1.0 ibex/km². In many areas the species had densities of only 0.1 to 0.3/km² as in the Shinghai Valley, Gilgit District (n = 15-50 animals, area surveyed = 176 km², Hess, 1986). Within the Gilgit District, Siberian ibex was clearly rarer in the southern than in the northern part. The reasons for this may be that compared to northern areas, elevations in the south are generally lower, there are higher densities of humans using alpine pastures, and there are smaller distances between villages. The census of the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1992) gives 2,545 animals for the whole province; in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 375 were estimated (Qayyum, 1986, 87). Recent surveys by Khan <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a total of 899 ibex in a survey area of 1,895 km² of Khunjerab National Park. They encountered the highest densities of ibex in the Muztagh-Taxkorgan region with an estimated 1.17 ibex per km²<sub>. </sub>Din <sub>et al</sub>. (2011) counted 429 ibex in 1,022 km² of northern Chitral (Torkhow valley). Rahman and Din (2016) in Chipursan Valley (Hunza) recorded 2,085 ibex (0.26/km²). Ali <em>et al</em>. (2007) counted 122 ibex in the Neelum Valley of Azad Kashmir. During 2010-2011 in Nagar Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan Ali <em>et al</em>. (2015) counted 478 in winter and 456 in spring, leading to density estimates of 0.33 and 0.32 per km² respectively. Khan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported 2,777 ibexes from the whole of Gilgit Baltistan, while annual surveys of ibex in central Karakoram National Park suggest numbers to be around 2,500 ibex.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species inhabits the mountain ranges, isolated mountains, and rocky outcrops of central and northeastern Afghanistan, China (northwestern tip of Gansu, western Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, possibly Tibet on its border with Xinjiang, Schaller 1998), northwestern India (Himalaya of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh), southern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia (Altai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, and Sayan Mountains, as well as in the southeast), northern Pakistan, Russia (southern Siberia, southern Tuva, and the Altai Mountains), Tajikistan and northeastern Uzbekistan (west Tian Shan) (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005, Harris <em>et al. </em>2009). </p>  <p>In Afghanistan, Siberian Ibex were historically found in steep habitat throughout the Afghan Hindu Kush and its outlying ranges (e.g., Spinghar, Kohe Baba, Safed Koh, Feroz Koh, Nuristan), but current distribution is not known. Its occurrence has been confirmed since 2000 in suitable habitat throughout the Afghan Pamir and along the Panj River of north-eastern Badakhshan, in particular in Wakhan, Ishkashem, Zebak, Rushan and Darvaz districts (Simms et al. 2014, Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017, Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> In China, Siberian Ibex occur primarily in the mountains surrounding Xinjiang, but also in those of extreme northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Populations are relatively widespread in western Xinjiang (Abudoukadi’er 2003) in the mountains around the Dzungarian Basin, including the mountains along the border with Kazakhstan from south of the Irtysh River, through the Kok Shaal Tau Mountains along the border with Kyrgyzstan and into the Pamir along the border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also throughout the Tian Shan ranges. Populations occur along the Sino-Mongolia border in the Baytik Mountains (Xinjiang), in the Mazongshan area of northern Gansu, and as far east as the Daqinshan of central Inner Mongolia (Wang 1998). Slightly separated from these are populations in the Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang, along China’s borders with Mongolia, and Russia. <br/> <br/> The Siberian Ibex has a widespread distribution in northeastern and eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and southern Siberia, where it occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from hot deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. It is found throughout the ranges of the Pamiro-Alay, Pamir, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Altai, and Tuva Mountains, as well as the western and eastern Sayan (Weinberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Fedosenko 2001). The species occurs in mountainous areas with sufficient rugged escape terrain and suitable pockets of grazing habitat, but is missing in the wide mountain valleys and plateaus intensively used for livestock grazing.<br/> <br/> In Mongolia, Siberian Ibex are patchily distributed in rugged terrain throughout the western half of the country, and in central and south-central Mongolia to the trans-Siberian railway line (Ulaanbaatar to Sainshand) (Dulamtseren 1970, 1977; Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). More specifically, ibex inhabit the Altai, Hangai, and Gobi Altai Mountain Ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Mallon 1985, Schaller 1994, Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). They also occur in the Sayan Mountains near the Russian border west of Lake Hovsgol and in scattered populations in the small mountains in the Transaltai Gobi and in canyons, rocky outcrops, and other rugged terrain throughout the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1977; Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1999a, 1999b; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). A small, introduced population survives in the Bogd Uul Mountains just outside of Ulaanbaatar (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The largest number of ibex occurs in the Altai and western Hangai Mountains (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Populations continue to become increasingly fragmented, especially in central and southeastern Mongolia (Schaller 1994, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). A long-term research project on ibex ecology is being conducted in northern Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in northern Dornogobi Aimag (Reading <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006b, 2007; Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Peterson 2016; Bragin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; Otgonbayar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/> <br/> In India, the Siberian Ibex occurs in the Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir, in the Karakorum, Zanskar and Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and in the Trans Himalayan and Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh, as far east as the Sutlej river (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992; Gaston <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1981; Pandey 1993). The species occurs in the western half of Ladakh, in the Shyok Valley (Nubra region) of northern Ladakh, along the Ladakh Range, and along both sides of the main Himalayan Range eastward to Shingo La (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a, 1992; Mallon 1991; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Its occurrence is very sparse east of the Zanskar River, a tributary of the Indus. It is present along the southern side of the Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir from the Zoji La eastwards to Himachal Pradesh, where it occurs throughout much of Lahul and Spiti, in the upper Beas and Parbati catchments, and Kinnaur in the east, primarily on the right bank of the Sutlej river (Fox <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1992; Pandey 1993; Bhatnagar 2003; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015; Ghoshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In&#160; Pakistan,&#160; the population of Himalayan Ibex&#160;is currently concentrated within the Karakoram Range, especially in the Districts of Hunza (Gojal Valley), Nagar (Hopper and Hisper), Shigar (Basha and Braldu) and Ghanche (Hushey and Kandey) (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015; Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In the Hindu Kush Range, the largest and most stable population occurs in Qurumber National Park and its buffer areas (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In the Himalayas, ibex habitat is shrinking overall; currently it is confined to Shouter Valley of Neelum Valley within the range that was reported for ibex in Pakistani Kashmir (Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Among the valleys of Gilgit-Balitstan that fall in the Himalayas, ibex exist in the Rupal, Rattu and Darley Valleys of Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan. In the Hindu Kush Range, the ibex survives in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the upper Chitral District. It is restricted to the relatively dry mountains between about 3,200 to greater than 5,000 m.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Siberian Ibex are harvested by subsistence hunters for their meat and by trophy hunters primarily for their skulls with horns sometimes also the entire skin. Locally the fur is used to produce high-end wool, called “yangir”, but the extent of this use is not known.",Terrestrial,"<p>Within Afghanistan, ibex are nominally protected from human harvest by a nationwide presidential ban on hunting. Ibex populations residing in the Ajar valley (in Bamyan Province) were listed by the Government’s National Environmental Protection Agency as legally protected in 2009, formally banning all hunting and trading of animals from this population within Afghanistan. They are present in the Wakhan National Park (declared in 2014), and the Bamyan Plateau protected area (declared in 2019), which incorporates the Ajar Valley. They are probably very few left in Band-e-Amir National Park (declared in 2009) and their status in Shah Foladi protected area (declared in 2019) is unknown. Conservation measures proposed include surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species.<br/> <br/> In China, the taxon is listed as Class I in the Wildlife Protection Law. Siberian ibex occur in at least eight nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Khanasi and Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), Tuomur Feng, Bogda Feng, Tianchi, West Tian Shan, and Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). Conservation measures proposed include determining the status of populations throughout their distribution in China, providing additional protection in some areas (e.g., in the Altai), considering others for development of managed, sustainable trophy hunting programs. These latter programs may be useful where ibex numbers are sufficiently abundant, and where removal or reduction of livestock is advised, local people should be provided with compensation. In northern Gansu, livestock should be managed to reduce conflicts with <em>C. sibirica</em>. It has also been suggested that a cross-boundary reserve be developed that would connect to the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia, not only to protect ibex but also other species.<br/> <br/> In India, the Project Snow Leopard, a national level policy for conservation in high elevation area promotes landscape scale participatory approaches within multi-use landscape (PSL 2008). Such a policy facilitates working with local communities to reduce impacts of livestock grazing and illegal hunting on wildlife in the region through the implementation of carefully developed management plans. Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2015) corroborate this by finding that most of the wildlife (including ibex) occur outside protected areas in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Siberian ibex is found in several protected areas in the western Himalayan region (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991a, 1994; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Bhatnagar 2003) including: Jammu and Kashmir (undivided) – Kishtwar and Hemis National Parks and Batkal Thajwas, Overa Aru, Kanji, Boodkharbu, Tongri, Rangdum, Karakoram, Lung Nag, Rizong Sabu, and Chukor Wildlife Sanctuaries; Himachal Pradesh - Pin Valley and Great Himalayan (possibly) National Parks and the Daranghati (possibly), Gamgul Siya-Behi, Kanawar, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Manali, Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/> <br/> Within ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia ibex are present in several strictly protected areas (<em>zapovedniks</em>) and National Parks. Among these are important areas: Kazakhstan: Aksu-Dzhabagly, Alma-Ata and Markakol, Altyn-Emel National Park; Kyrgyzstan: Besh-Aral, Naryn, Sarychat-Ertash and Sary-Chelek, Ala-Archa National Park, Khan-Tengri National Park; Russia: Sayano-Shushensky and Altai; Tajikistan: Romit, Zorkul, Tajik National Park; Uzbekistan: Chatkal, Gissar and Zaamin, Ugam-Chatkal National Park, Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserve. Hunting by domestic hunters based on permits and hunting seasons exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and in few hunting areas in Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting for ibex exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting can be important for conserving the species, as it can provide incentives to prevent poaching, but usually only if implemented as community-based programs. Most such operations in the former Soviet Union involve former poachers and the income they provide encourages these people to refrain from poaching and to prevent others from poaching (Michel and Rosen 2016). Bans of trophy hunting as proposed in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and 2019 or prohibition of trophy imports would remove such incentives and could result in higher mortality from unregulated illegal use. In Kyrgyzstan (since 2010) and Tajikistan (since 2008) community-based game management led to local recoveries of ibex numbers (Michel and Rosen 2016) in areas where previously poaching had reduced population sizes to low levels (SULi 2019). For instance, in Tajikistan 4 such game management areas with a total area 2,250 km² harbor about 2,300 animals with further community-based areas under development. Hunting and tourism revenues finance the management of these areas, managed by local NGOs created mainly by former poachers. Also in Kyrgyzstan, on several thousand square kilometers community-based organizations prevent poaching and thus support ibex conservation, although so far hunting quotas have not been assigned in any of these areas. Conservation measures proposed include the expansion of community-based hunting management and protection and the increase of protected areas effectiveness with a focus on stopping poaching and regulation of livestock grazing to prevent forage competition and habitat degradation. </p>  <p>In Mongolia, ibex is legally protected as a Rare species under the Mongolian Law on Fauna and the Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). No general hunting is allowed, but a limited amount of licensed trophy hunting is permitted. The species is listed as Near Threatened in most recent Mongolian Red List (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006), which represents a change in status from the last 2 Mongolian Red Books, in which the species was listed as Threatened (Shagdarsuren 1987; Shiirevdamba <em>et al</em>. 1997). Approximately 14% of the species’ range is protected (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006) and it occurs in at least the following protected areas: Altai-Taivan Bogd, Bodgkhan Mountains, Eej Khairkhan Mountain, Great Gobi, Gobi Gurvan Saikhan, Ikh Nart, Khangai Nuruu, Khar-Uvs Lake, Khokh Serkh Mountain, Khovsgol Lake, Otgontenger Mountain, Sharga Natural Reserve, Silkhem Mountain, Tarvagatai Mountain, Tost Mountains, Tsambagarav, Uvs Lake, and Yoliin Valley. Khokh Serkh Nature Reserve in the Altai region was established specifically for the conservation of this species. A long-term research project on ibex in Ikh Nart has been established for several years now, and several hundred are estimated to be living within this protected area (R. Reading pers. comm.). Conservation measures proposed include: 1) Undertake more rigorous population surveys of all populations; 2) Study the ecology, particularly habitat requirements and movement patterns, and the impacts of livestock grazing on ibex; 3) Hire, train, and equip law enforcement agents, especially for protected areas; 4) Begin using the money generated from trophy hunting to pay for conservation and management of the species, ideally using community-based approaches (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016); 5) Establish new protected areas to conserve additional populations of ibex; and 6) Collaborate better with Russia and China to protect populations that live in border regions. Trophy hunters purchase hunting licenses from which US$800 for Altai ibex and UD$720 for Gobi ibex are theoretically allocated to the government for a quota of 260 animals per year (MNE 2005). Little to none of this money is used specifically for conservation or management of the species (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), although a small percentage of the money goes toward general conservation activities, such as the budgets of regional protected areas administrations. <br/> <br/> Within Pakistan, Shackleton (1997) reported numerous protected areas providing differing levels of protection to ibex. These include: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Agram-Basti Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Goleen Gol Game Reserve (GR); Swat District: Giddar Baik WS, Mahu Dand GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan - Gilgit District: Khunjerab NP, Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Kilik-Mintaka GR, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR, Pakura Nallah GR, Chassi-Bowshdar GR, Nazbar Nallah GR (Rasool no date); Diamir District: Astor WS (Rasool n. d.); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Satpara WS, Nar Nallah GR, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir – Muzaffarabad District: Ghamot GR, Machiara GR (Qayyum 1986, 1987; Zool. Survey Dept. 1986). Mahu Dand GR was created for ibex in 1992. WWF-Pakistan began a hunting program in 1990 at the Bar village near Gilgit (Johnson 1997, Arshad 2002). In 1991, IUCN-Pakistan, with support from UNDP, in co-operation with local people and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, initiated a planning process to survey protected areas and to prepare an overall sustainable-use wildlife management plan for ibex populations. The program involves hunting by both local and foreign hunters. Conservation measures include: 1) Provide complete legal protection for the species and 2) Establish a proper hunting system involving a management plan for locals, as well as for foreigners. Hunting occurs in areas with healthy populations. This trophy hunting program has benefited the ibex population in Pakistan, and helped many populations to recover in several valleys of northern Pakistan (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It inhabits steep and rocky terrain in evergreen and deciduous forests, especially with exposed grassy ridges from about 500–2,000 m asl. It eats a wide range of plant material: grass, herbs and shoots, leaves of small trees, nuts, and even some fruit. Group home range size is typically around 40 hectares, with males occupying marked territories of 22–25 hectares during the mating season. They typically live in small groups of 4–12 individuals, with older males usually solitary. Gorals are diurnal, and are most active in the early morning and late evening, but can be active throughout on overcast days. It keeps to steeper slopes where it is very agile over rocky crags and cliffs. The gestation length is 6.5 months (Patton <em>et al</em>. 2000). Males and females reach sexual maturity at approximately three years, with a lifespan of up to 15 years or so. Mating takes place in early winter, and one, or rarely two-three, kids are born about 6.5 months later.","In Russia and the Republic of Korea, major threats to its survival include habitat loss due to forestry, agriculture, and poaching. In addition, the fragmentation of habitat due to development and roads is a major threat. Threats from heavy snow in Mt. Sorak, Samcheok city and Ulgin county are also observed (Cho <em>et al. </em>2015). Threats in China include shooting, snaring, habitat degradation, and competition from domestic livestock (Smith and Xie 2008). Poaching is both for traditional medicine and meat. In Russia, an increased number of small boats owned by people apparently have led to increased poaching pressure in seashore goral habitats.","In 2017, the total number of goral in Russia was estimated at 700–1,100 animals (Zaumyslova <em>et al.</em> 2017), with insignificant decline. Myslenkov and Voloshina (1989) indicated no decline in numbers or disappearance of any known local population, and that numbers along the Sea of Japan may have been slowly increasing. Lazo District has about 190-230 animals, Terneisky District around 200–250, Olginsky District 75–105, and Dalnegorsky District 95–25, Kavalerovski District 2–3, Partizanski District 13–23, Anuchinski District 38–60, Chuguevski District 14–22, Shkotovski District 5–7, Khasanski District 2–3 goral. <br/><br/>In the Republic of Korea, fewer than 50 animals were estimated to remain on Konbong mountain in Konsong-gun, Kangwon Province, near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) (Won 1988).

Won (1997) estimated less than 50 animals, but the basis for this estimate was unclear. <br/><br/>There are no reliable population estimates for Long-tailed Goral in China. Smith and Xie (2008) considered it to be strongly reduced in numbers.",Decreasing,"<p>Long-tailed Goral are found in eastern Russia (Primorsky Territory), northeastern China, the Republic of Korea (Grubb, 2005). It is possible that a population of Long-tailed Gorals the Democratic People’s Republic (DPR) of Korea has been extirpated. In Russia, Long-tailed Goral were previously distributed along almost the entire southern half of Sikhote-Alin range, (i.e. the entire Primorsky Territory and southern part of Khabarovsk Territory) and in Jewish Autonomus region. Currently, about 80% of Russian population is located alone the sea shore between Belkin cape (45.820278, 137.690833) and Ostrovnoy cape (42.810483, 133.719248) i.e. Sikhote-Alin range still harbours the population while Khabarovsk Territory and Jewish Autonomus region do not. Northeastern border of Long-tailed Goral range is located in Krasnoarmeyski district of Primorsky Territory, at the upstream of Kolumbe River where a goral was shot in year of 1997. &#160;Southwest border of Long-tailed Goral range in Primorsky Territory is located in Ussuri Nature Reserve. Since goral are confined to specific habitat—steep rocky slopes covered with sparse, montane broad-leaved forest, from sea level to about 1,000 m (Heptner <em>et al</em>., 1961), and cliffs and forests are necessary for goral habitats, there are just a few inland places with stable populations: landmark ‘Stone Gate’ in Dalnegorsk district, upstream of Milogradovka River in Olga district, watershed of Izvilinka River, Chuguevski district, and Prozrachnaya River, Anuchino district (Zaumyslova and Bondarchuk 2017).<br/><br/>In China the Long-tailed Goral is found in the northeast, and stretches along the Xiao Hinggan Ling mountains (Lesser Khingan range), along the lower reaches of Sungari and Amur Rivers in eastern Jilin and Heilong Jiang, and eastern Liaoning, and includes the Changbaishan range (Jilin) on the border with DPR Korea (Wang 2003, Smith and Xie 2008).<br/><br/>In DPR Korea, little is known of the recent distribution of this species (Shackleton, 1997). It is likely that it occurs (or rather it occurred) in the Hamgyong mountains which lie inland from the northeastern coastline, and in the Taebaek mountains in the southwest. Since the DMZ is restricted by a 243 km fence, the habitat is not connected to Republic of Korea. A third area where it may occur is the Nanghim mountains in the north-central part of DPR Korea. These are extensions of the Changhai mountains from Jilin (China).<br/><br/>In the Republic of Korea, from east sea coast of the city of Goseong-gun, Gangwon province, to the east of the city of Pocheon, Gyeonggi province.

Solenodon obtain food by rooting in the ground using its foreclaws and then using its snout, and in leaf litter with their snouts and by tearing into rotten logs and trees with their foreclaws. Myriapod, earthworm, insects and their larvae, spiders, molluscs, and small vertebrates as lizard and frogs, form most of its diet (Manójina and Abreu 2012). This species is mainly nocturnal, hiding during the day in rock clefts, hollow trees, or burrows which it excavates itself above the leaf litter (Borroto-Páez and Beque Quiala 2011). Adult Cuban Solenodons are solitary, other than mothers with young. Litter size is 1-2 young. The young are born in a nesting burrow.

According to the Red List Guidelines (IUCN 2019), this assessment focuses primarily on free-living (wild) subpopulations that are larger than Minimum Viable Population (MVP) size (150 mature animals), and finds a genuine increasing change in the past five years and since the most recent Red List assessment (Olech 2008); so that the species no longer qualifies for threatened status (Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable) under Red List Criteria A-E per below (IUCN 2019). In 2019, there were only eight subpopulations greater than MVP that included 2,518 mature animals, with no subpopulation including greater than 500 mature animals; thus making this species nearly qualify for Vulnerable C2a(i). Additional consideration of free-living subpopulations that are less  than MVP, indicates that this species warrants Near Threatened status in  light of its dependence on ongoing conservation programmes to persist  beyond the next five years, a very limited number of viable free-living  subpopulations (eight), and a large number of small isolated  free-living subpopulations less than MVP (39). While the number of  conservation herds and individuals in subpopulations managed for  species conservation and ecological restoration is increasing, all  free-living mature individuals occur within active management programmes  which, if ceased, would result in the species qualifying for a threatened  status. The species is not currently in decline but the overall free-living population size of wild mature individuals could decline or suffer extreme fluctuation if current protections are reduced or removed. This is a conservation dependent species and several exacerbating factors described below are anticipated to continue across the current and next generation unless there are substantial multi-national adjustments in management of free-living European Bison.&#160; </p>    <p></p><ol><li><u><strong>Population viability</strong>.</u> There are very few viable subpopulations (only eight out of 47 free-living subpopulations are greater than MVP). Most free-living bison subpopulations are very small (e.g. ~34% <u>&lt;</u> 25 mature animals, ~51% <u>&lt;</u>50 mature individuals, and ~83% include less than MVP of 150 mature animals), indicating that natural selection dynamics are not operating adequately. Quantitative population viability analyses of the eight free-living populations greater than MVP have not been completed.</li><li><u><strong>Genetics</strong>.</u> Mean expected heterozygosity, calculated on the basis of microsatellite data, has been estimated as 0.29 (29%) for the Lowland line and 0.35 (35%) for the Lowland-Caucasian line (Tokarska unpublished). This low genetic variability negatively influences effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>). For example, the largest subpopulation is the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest (462 mature animals), yet the effective population size is calculated as less than 30 (Tokarska <em>et al. </em>2009). Based on the extremely limited number of founder animals, this tremendous disparity between subpopulation number of mature animals and N<sub>e</sub> can be reliably inferred for other free-ranging subpopulations.</li><li><u><strong>Fragmentation</strong>.</u>&#160;Approximately 77% of 43 free living subpopulations for which information is available are functionally isolated by distance or an impermeable barrier. Approximately 30% of free-living subpopulations are isolated by an impermeable barrier (man-made or natural) from the nearest neighbour subpopulation. For subpopulations not isolated by a natural or man-made barrier, 60% are at least 60 km from the nearest-neighbour subpopulation (range 60–530 km). It can be expected that subpopulations at a greater distance from a nearest neighbour are much less likely to see successful natural dispersal or exchange of cows (and their genetics) between subpopulations across multiple generations, thus we can infer further genetic drift of inherently low genetic diversity to be amplified through long-term isolation.</li><li><u><strong>Supplemental feeding and selective culling</strong>.</u> The majority of free-living European Bison subpopulations were restored into forest habitats, which often do not provide sufficient food resources year round for this large herbivore. Supplemental feeding occurs at all eight subpopulations greater than MVP, and is reported for 34 out 46 free living subpopulations for which information is available. Selective culling is reported for six out of eight subpopulations greater than MVP. While supplemental feeding and selective culling are well-intentioned to manage subpopulation distribution and abundance to protect bison from poaching and to reduce conflicts with surrounding land uses, there is concern that long-term reliance on these management techniques could lead to unintended consequences, including unsustainable expense, reduced subpopulation viability, and disruption of the species evolved natural life history.</li><li><u><strong>Conservation dependence</strong>.</u> Free-living European Bison are a conservation dependent species. Though the total mature population size for the eight subpopulations greater than MVP has been increasing for the past generation, there have also been recent incidents of local extinction of other subpopulations (see WWF 2019). While the species is not currently in decline, the abundance of wild mature individuals could be reduced if there are significant perturbations such as a major disease outbreak, or current management regimes are negatively changed or removed. Such major perturbations have occurred previously leading to the species changing from Vulnerable to Endangered status in Red List Assessments conducted in 1996 and 2000. Progress in recovery of the European Bison through large-scale ecological restoration projects will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by governments, harmonisation of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organisations, and public tolerance and support of free-living bison managed as wildlife on large landscapes. Cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different nations and organisations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible.</li></ol><u><br/><strong>Red List Criterion A</strong></u><strong> </strong>– Population Size Reduction.&#160;Not applicable.&#160;Over three generations (36 years, 1983–2019), the number of free-living mature animals in subpopulations greater than MVP has increased from several hundred to over 2,500.<br/><br/><strong><u>Red List Criterion B</u> </strong>– Geographic Range.&#160;Not applicable.&#160;The minimum-maximum AOO of the eight subpopulations &gt;MVP is 13,236-22,100 km², and exceeds the Criteria B threshold of 2,000 km².

Quantitative population viability analyses of the eight free-living subpopulations greater than MVP have not been completed.","<p>The majority of European Bison subpopulations were (re)introduced to forest habitats (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, patterns of habitat use strongly vary between different population and are strongly shaped by habitat structure (forest cover) and management actions (Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al.</em> 2018). Preference towards open habitats such as meadows, river valleys, abandoned farmland, forest gaps and clearing is observed (Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2011, Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019, Zielke <em>et al</em>. 2019). European Bison are mixed feeders or browsers (Gębczyńska <em>et al.</em> 1991; Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2019; Bocherens <em>et al.</em> 2015, Merceron <em>et al.</em> 2015), which continuously adjust their diet with seasonal availability of easily digestible non-grass vegetation (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019). In winter, bison foraging ecology can be strongly influenced by supplementary feeding (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2011). Non-fed populations usually utilise open habitats and agriculture areas. Farm crops depredation is compensated in some countries. European bison are not territorial and their spatial organisation and population density are influenced by habitat quality and food abundance (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2020). Home ranges of bison covers from several dozen to two hundred km<sup>2</sup>, in relation to habitat structure and seasonal migrations (Kowalczyk and Plumb 2020). Home range sizes of mixed groups are influenced by the distribution and availability of forage resources, while home range of mature males is more related to reproductive behaviour and activity than food-related factors. In many populations seasonal migrations are observed, driven by supplementary feeding or access to food resources out of forest habitats, or having altitudinal character to avoid harsh winter conditions (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013, Perzanowski <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; Dispersal by male bison has occured up to several hundred km (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013). Dispersal by mixed groups is beginning to be observed in expanding populations, as the result of density-dependent intra-specific competition (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013, Krasińska <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; The European Bison exhibits a well-developed and dynamic social organisation (Krasińska <em>et al.</em> 2014). Mixed groups of up to 20 individuals generally, including adult cows, 2–3-year-old sub-adults and calves are the basic social units. Males remain solitary or form bachelor groups of two to eight animals. The size and composition of mixed groups are dynamic and change seasonally, being the largest during rut and winter aggregations (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013). Daily activity is typical of large ruminants and includes foraging bouts (up to five hours) alternating with resting bouts (up to four hours) devoted primarily to rumination (Caboń-Raczyńska <em>et al.</em> 1987).&#160; <br/></p>","<p><u><strong>Genetics</strong><br/></u>Contemporary genetic variability of European Bison is relatively low, being an effect of population bottleneck due to species extirpation in the wild in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century and subsequent restoration from limited number of captive survivors. The entire contemporary species population derives from only 12 individual genotypes (Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004, Wójcik <em>et al.</em> 2009, Tokarska <em>et al.</em> 2011). Mean expected heterozygosity, calculated on the basis of microsatellite data, has been estimated as 0.29 (29%) for the Lowland line and 0.35 (35%) for the Lowland-Caucasian line (Tokarska, unpublished). This low genetic variability negatively influences effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>). For example, the largest subpopulation is the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest (462 mature animals), yet the effective population size is likely less than 30 (Tokarska <em>et al. </em>2009). Based on the extremely limited number of founder animals, this tremendous disparity between subpopulation number of mature animals and N<sub>e</sub> can be reliably inferred for other free-ranging subpopulations.<br/><br/><u><strong>Fragmentation and small population size</strong><br/></u>Approximately 77% of free-living subpopulations for which information is available are functionally isolated and fragmented from nearest neighbour populations by distance or barriers (man-made or natural). There are only eight subpopulations that exceed MVP, and ~34% of all free-living subpopulations include 25 or fewer mature animals, ~51% include 50 or fewer mature individuals, and ~83% of the populations include less than MVP. Given the small size of most free-living subpopulations, those at a greater distance from a nearest neighbour are much less likely to see successful natural dispersal or exchange of cows (and their genetics) between subpopulations across multiple generations, and thus we can infer further genetic drift of inherently low genetic diversity to be amplified through long-term isolation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Refugee Species</strong><br/></u>When restoration into the wild began in 1952, the European Bison was characterised as a forest specialist and thus the species was restored in forest habitats. Increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that the European Bison is also adapted to effective use of open and mixed habitats (Mendoza and Palmqvist 2008, Kerley <em>et al. 2012</em>, Bocherens <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al. </em>2019). Recently, the species has been recharacterized as a refugee species, that can no longer access optimal habitat, but is confined to sub-optimal habitats, with consequences of decreased fitness and density, and attendant conservation risks (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012). The process of becoming a refugee species likely started after the last glaciation due to increasing human pressure related to human spread and development of Neolithic agriculture, and was reinforced during species restoration (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012, Hofman-Kamińska 2019). Confinement of an open-habitat adapted species to forest habitats may act against natural selection pressures, entails supplementary feeding, intensifies management complexity, increases management expense, increases vulnerability to disease and parasites, and may increase risks of human-wildlife conflicts when bison attempt to move out of forests (Hofman-Kamińska and Kowalczyk 2012; Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012; Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013; Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016a, b, c; Samojlik <em>et al.</em> 2019). Contemporary habitat selection indicates the species’ preference for open and wet/open habitats and abandoned fields over the forests, especially coniferous ones (Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2018, Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019, Zielke <em>et al.</em> 2019). As a large and potentially conflicting species, European Bison require large spaces of mosaic habitats supporting the populations year round, with lower human densities and agricultural activities, to reduce potential conflicts. Such areas are limited in Europe. Increasing land abandonment in Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine) creates potentially suitable conditions for species restoration (Alcantra <em>et al. </em>2013), however instability of nature conservation in those countries makes these areas risky. Forest introductions are still continuing (e.g. Bad Berleburg, Germany and Augustów Forest, NE Poland), though recent reintroduction in Romania and Bulgaria in suitable remote mountainous areas may lead to subpopulation growth with less conflict.<br/><br/><u><strong>Disease</strong><br/></u>Knowledge on health status of European Bison comes from limited number of populations, mainly in Poland. While several diseases are known to occur in European Bison, including blue tongue virus, foot-and-mouth disease, respiratory viruses, and bovine tuberculosis (Larska and Krzysiak 2019), they are not as broadly distributed within or across free-ranging populations as the infectious parasites. Nearly 90 species of parasites in European Bison were identified (Karbowiak <em>et al.</em> 2014a, b), with species richness, prevalence and intensity of infections increasing in multiple populations (Drożdż 1998). It was documented that supplementary feeding and unnatural aggregation of bison in winter at fixed locations lead to increased parasitic load (Radwan <em>et al. </em>2010, Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012, Karbowiak <em>et al.</em> 2014b, Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Adaptive management has proven effective in reducing parasite transmission and risk of diseases (Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016b).<br/><br/><u><strong>Culling, hunting, poaching</strong><br/></u>Paradoxically for a species with low numbers, some free-living subpopulations (including small ones) are subjected to culling to reduce number, regulate sex-age structure or even for commercial hunting purposes. This policy contrasts strongly with the management of other large mammals which have undergone similar population declines as the European Bison and for which populations are now increasing in response to conservation management, such as the rhinoceros or the Cape Mountain Zebra (Emslie 2008, IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group 2008, Hrabar and Kerley 2013). Poaching plays locally important role especially in small populations exposed to high stochasticity. In the 1990s, uncontrolled hunting and poaching in Ukraine during democratic transformation resulted in a strong decline or extirpation of bison herds (WWF 2019).<br/><br/><u><strong>Policy inconsistency</strong><br/></u>Though this issue was identified in the 2004 <em>European Bison Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan</em> (Pucek <em>et al. </em>2004), it still remains an important concern. The European Bison is generally a protected species in the countries where it occurs. It is covered by EU legislation in frame of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, and included in the Annex 2 (animal and plant species of community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation) as priority species, and Annex 4 (animal and plant species of community interest in need of strict protection). However, across the historic range, there are inconsistent national policies regarding management and conservation procedures, that can concede to habitat degradation, population restriction, and selective culling. Following political transformations in Eastern Europe, uncontrolled hunting and poaching in Russia and Ukraine lead to population decline (Pucek <em>et al</em>. 2004, WWF 2019). Such inconsistency not only impacts existing populations, but also limits the possibility of restoration and population expansion. Large areas of abandoned fields in eastern Europe in recent decades (especially in Russia and Ukraine) (Alcantara <em>et al.</em> 2013) may now be suitable for the introduction of the bison, but cannot currently be considered due to insufficient protection.</p>","<p>This assessment adheres to the IUCN Red List Guidelines and utilises IUCN terminology intended for consistency across taxa (IUCN 2019). For this assessment, ‘subpopulation’ does not infer a meta-population. The Red List term ‘wild’ equates to the ‘free-living’ animals as reported in the EBPB, and does not include the EBPB “captivity” or “semi-free living (e.g. large enclosures)” categories. This assessment also refers to the term ‘minimum viable population (MVP)' as an <strong></strong>ecological threshold <span lang=""IT"">that specifies the smallest number of individuals in a subpopulation capable of persisting at a specific statistical probability level for a predetermined amount of time. This Red List assessment (RLA) uses the occupied grid cell approach to estimate ‘area of occupancy (AOO)’; by counting the number of occupied cells in a uniform grid that covers the entire range of distribution, and then tallying the total area (km²) of all occupied cells; so that AOO = number of occupied cells × area of an individual cell (IUCN 2019). Though the Red List Guidelines recommend using a uniform 2 x 2 km grid for consistency across taxon, we also used a comparative 10 x 10 km grid that better aligns to the spatial scale of the landscape ecology of the European Bison (see Kowalczyk <em>et al. </em>2013, Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2018, J.A. Hernandez-Blanco pers. comm. 2020, G. Wilson pers. comm. 2020), in order to generate comparative minimum and maximum AOO estimates. <span lang=""EN-GB"">The term ‘extent of occurrence (EOO)’ is the calculated minimum convex polygon area size (km²) for a set of subpopulations (IUCN 2019).<br/><br/>In addition to information from the European Bison Pedigree Book, this assessment also considers subpopulation-specific information to assess whether a subpopulation is deemed to contribute to the number of mature individuals considered in a Red List Assessment. A key consideration is whether a free-living subpopulation includes sufficient mature animals to maintain the potential for ecological adaption through the effects of natural selection operating on viable populations. While there is variation in age-class demography between subpopulations, this information is not uniformly monitored or reported to EBPB. As reported in the detailed species monograph by Krasińska and Krasiński (2013), the mature age class generally accounts for approximately 60% of a subpopulation. Thus, for this assessment, the 60% mature age class was applied uniformly to each subpopulation. Taking into account the levels of inbreeding of the European Bison population (described below), Brook <em>et&#160;al.</em> (2002)<span class=""MsoHyperlink""> calculated the MVP of a subpopulation as 250 individuals for a 95% probability of subpopulation survival for 100 years; thus yielding a generalized MVP of 150 mature animals (250 * 0.60). Subpopulation size trend (increasing, decreasing, stable) was assessed between 2015–2019 (as reported in the 2016 and 2020 EBPB). The Red List Guidelines prescribe analyses to be conducted for the recent 10 years, or three generations, whichever is longer (IUCN 2019). For this assessment, generation length is calculated as 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction (IUCN 2019), wherein the age of first reproduction is set at 4 years and adult mortality set at 13% (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013), so that generation length = 4+ 1/.13 = 11.7 rounded up to 12 years. Thus, for the analyses herein, three generations equal 36 years. Fragmentation is considered through measurements of distance (km) to nearest neighbour subpopulation and whether there are natural or man-made barriers to dispersal movement between subpopulations. Additional consideration is given to whether subpopulation resources are naturally limited or if the subpopulation otherwise receives supplemental feeding; and whether a subpopulation is subject to selective culling. Belarus has indicated that, while the&#160;Nacional’nyjj Park Pripjatskijj is reported to the EBPB as one subpopulation, there are actually two free living herds that are isolated from each other (P. Veligurov pers. comm.); and are reported herein as two distinct subpopulations. Russia has indicated that, while the Kaluzhskije Zaseki Zapovednik plus Nacional’nyjj Park Ugra and the Orlovskoe Poles’e Nacional'nyjj Park are reported to EBPB as two units under separate management, there is natural movement exchange of mature animals between the two management units (J.A Blanco-Hernandez pers. comm.), and so they have been combined into one subpopulation for this assessment. Ukraine has reported that, while the Forest Range “Storozhynetske” (Chernivtsi Region) and the Forest Hunting Range “Beregometske” (Chernivtsi Region) are reported to EPBP as separate management units, there is natural movement exchange of mature animals between the two management units, so they are combined in this assessment. This is also the case for the Ukraine Hunting Range “Zvirivske” (Volyn Region) and the Limited Liability Company “Maidan Myslyvskyi” (Volyn Regioin), so these are also combined into one subpopulation (V.

Lowland Bison were distributed across western and eastern Europe (Węcek <em>et al.</em> 2016, Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004), while the Caucasian Bison occurred only in the northern Caucasus mountains and foothills (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1966). As a generalist quadruped, the European Bison evolved to utilise open or mixed habitats; and with relatively high mobility in response to environmental drivers, there was likely substantial variation in local abundance and density, including extended absences at local to regional scales while the species was still distributed across the historic range. In short, the European Bison was likely patchily distributed and did not occur everywhere all the time within suitable habitat within its historic range. Extensive forest expansion occurred 12,000–8,000 Before Present (BP) concomitant with reduced open habitats available for large herbivores such as Bison and Aurochs. Humans expanded with the development of Neolithic agriculture (7,000-5,000 years BP) resulting in pressures on bison including hunting and land use conversion to agriculture. The species became absent from most of Europe between 9,500 and 7,000 years BP,&#160; and after this period, recovered or recolonised, probably from east (see Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the 16<sup>th</sup> century, European Bison persisted in the wild only through royal protection. By the 19<sup>th</sup> century, free-living European Bison were limited to only the Białowieża Forest of northeast Poland and western Belarus, and Caucasus mountains (Pucek <em>et a</em>l. 2004). By the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the species was increasingly imperilled in the wild, with the Lowland Bison becoming Extinct in the Wild in 1919, and the Caucasian Bison Extinct in the Wild by 1927 (Pucek <em>et al. </em>2004).<br/>&#160; <br/></p><strong></strong>","In general, free-living European bison are not subject to extensive trade and use. All free-living subpopulations exist at locations where management emphasis is primarily on protection of the species; with some locations utilizing supplemental feeding and selective culling to manage local distribution and abundance in order to mitigate potential poaching and conflicts with surrounding land uses.",Terrestrial,"<p><u><strong>Population Viability</strong><br/></u>While the European Bison is no longer threatened by extinction, most free-living subpopulations are small and isolated. Small, isolated subpopulations are at risk from random catastrophic events, and also lose genetic diversity more quickly than large subpopulations through the process of genetic drift, which in turn can decrease the viability of populations through an accumulation of inbreeding and loss of adaptive capacity. To mitigate the loss of genetic diversity in these isolated subpopulations, bison population viability analyses have suggested increasing subpopulation size where possible, and otherwise restoring effective gene flow among subpopulations and managing under a meta-population framework, where gene flow can be restored either through the restoration of natural movements between populations or through the translocation of animals (or gametes) among populations (Daleszczyk and Bunevich 2009, Hartway <em>et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/><u><strong>Conservation planning</strong><br/></u>In 2004, the IUCN-SSC-BSG published a report entitled “<em>European Bison Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan</em>” (CAP, Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004). With the free-living population growing from 1,848 in 2003 to 6,244 in 2019, it is clearly time for undertaking a new collaborative multi-stakeholder conservation planning process to produce an update to the 2004 CAP that includes a long-term conservation action plan with a very strong scientific basis and actionable consensus. Key issues needing to be examined include climate and environmental change, science advances and needs, increased interest in restoration programs involving large mammals, meta-population dynamics, conservation genetics (including the prevailing emphasis on separation of the Lowland (<em>B. b. bonasus</em>) and Caucasian (<em>Bison bonasus bonasus</em> x <em>B. b. caucasicus</em>) genetic lines amongst free-living subpopulations), disease ecology, habitat availability and shifting land use practices, restoration and translocation priorities, human dimensions, integrated <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> management, and European Union and variable national and legal and policy status. The IUCN-SSC-BSG is formally partnering with the IUCN-SSC-Conservation Planning Specialist Group and multiple European wildlife conservation organisations to undertake collaborative conservation planning to produce an updated IUCN CAP that will serve as an innovative, efficient and effective milestone for its potential to empower new initiatives and result in better alignment of multi-national conservation strategies and actions.<br/><br/><u><strong>Science needs</strong><br/></u>There is a critical need to enhance levels of collaborative and comparative science. Enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of restoration activities should include testing of alternative hypotheses about landscape ecology, analysing habitat availability and suitability for optimal restoration designs, and comparative analyses of population viability and potential meta-population management strategies (see Daleszczyk and Bunevich 2009, Hartway <em>et al.</em> 2020, <em>Kerley et al</em> 2012, 2020). Comparative analyses of the effects of selective culling and supplemental feeding will be important for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local conservation management. Also needed are comparative analyses of bison ecology across the historic range (e.g. population ecology, metapopulation macrophysiology, foraging ecology, competition with sympatric wild ungulates, ecological cascades, ethology, etc.), comprehensive disease and parasitology monitoring, and innovative social science that addresses the human dimensions of bison recovery.<br/><br/><u><strong>Adaptive Management</strong><br/></u>Achieving the full ecological recovery of the European Bison conservation will require collaboration of researchers, managers, and policymakers to develop and implement science-based adaptive management (Kerley and Knight 2010). There is a need to institutionalise evidence-based capacity to learn and adjust management as needed to restore bison to optimal habitats that secure the needs of the species throughout the year and spacious enough to maintain viable populations (Samojlik <em>et al. </em>2019). It is very important to adaptively manage for an effective and efficient balance of supplementary feeding and culling with conservation of the full extent of the species naturally evolved ecology. Adaptive management can also serve as a framework to restore large heterogeneous landscapes that include forests, meadows and open habitats for both existing and future bison herds, thereby potentially lowering the expense of supplementary feeding when introducing to suitable habitats; to gain and employ improved understanding of the human dimensions of bison recovery and thereby enhance active social support that includes financial and habitat commitments; and to strive for effective long-term genetic conservation and population viability by establishing sufficiently large meta-populations that link smaller isolated populations across regional geographic ranges.&#160;</p><p><strong></strong></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is also found near large coral columns and heads at the edges and slopes of patch reefs (depths of eight to 52 m) and feeds on plankton. It hovers above bottom in caves and shaded areas in reefs (Smith 1997). It is a benthic spawner.

It has a 60-day pelagic larval life and matures rapidly. They are sexually active in as few as three weeks and live for about two months after settlement. This is the first reported fish in which the pelagic larval duration is generally longer than the post-settlement lifespan, which indicates that&#160;<em>C. kuna</em>&#160;may represent the extreme of a bipartite life-history strategy: a relatively slow-growing pelagic larval stage, often with delayed metamorphosis, in combination with a rapidly maturing, high-mortality adult stage (Victor&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010).

This has resulted in disturbance to the natural vegetation that is exacerbated on Monito by its much smaller size and lower vegetation cover (Hedges and Conn 2012). These authors report that human disturbance on the island is at an ""all time high"", although note that the impacts on biodiversity are unknown. Increasing migration carries with it an elevated risk that exotic mammals, particularly black rats (which were formerly present, and implicated in declines in the gecko <em>Sphaerodactylus micropithecus</em>), could become established on Monito (Hedges and Conn 2012).","This species is known from only seven museum specimens, collected in 1993, and an earlier sight record of a single animal reported by Rolle <em>et al.</em> (1964) presumed to be referable to <em>Spondylurus monitae</em> (Hedges and Conn 2012).

The quality of habitat within the species' range appears to be in decline due to the effects of human transportation and logging (Bradfield and Daltry 2009, L. Grismer pers. comm. January 2008), however the species' apparent preference for breeding in grassy areas on paths and forest edges may indicate some level of tolerance to moderate disturbance&#160;(T. Neang pers. comm.

Recent satellite imagery shows some areas of cleared land scattered throughout this species' range. A major cause of habitat loss in the Cardamom Mountains (including within Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary) is the illegal removal of certain tree species for the harvest and refinement of safrole oil - a precursor to the production of elicit narcotics including methylenedioxymethamphetamine (known commonly as ecstasy) (Bradfield and Daltry 2009). This species' type-locality is described as heavily affected by logging (J. Holden pers. comm. March 2012) and parts of its range have been cleared for agriculture (T. Neang pers. comm.

However there is considerable uncertainty as to whether such disturbances are affecting the species' population, as it has been observed breeding in affected environments&#160;(T. Neang pers. comm. October 2015). Several observations of parasitism on the species have been observed where arthropods (possibly Diptera) deposited eggs into the frogs' egg masses. The insect larvae presumably sequestered nutriment from the frog eggs as infected masses yielded no young (T. Neang pers. comm. October 2015). Research is warranted to determine whether this constitutes a threat to <em>Chiromantis samkosensis</em> and other amphibians with a similar reproductive strategy.","Little is known about the size or trends of this species' population except that some breeding assemblages of around 10 individuals and egg masses have been observed throughout its range (T.

Marquez, D. Cisneros-Heredia and A. Arteaga pers. comm).","Invasive house geckos represent the major threat to this species. Since the 1970s, three species of house gecko have been detected on inhabited islands within the archipelago. <em>Lepidodactylus lugubris</em> and <em>Phyllodactylus reissii</em> have long-established populations in urban and disturbed areas, and have been associated with declines in <em>P. galapagensis</em>; while <em>L. lugubris</em> - a widely-introduced species with origins in Asia and Oceania - is almost strictly associated with human habitations throughout its introduced range, the South American <em>P. reissii </em>has adaptations that may enable it to colonize natural habitats and outcompete the native gecko (Hoogmoed 1989), although no evidence yet exists that this has occurred. The recent appearance of <em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em>, a globally introduced Asian gecko that is typically also confined to disturbed areas but which has been implicated in the extinction of <em>Nactus</em> geckos on Mauritius (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2005) and declines in other island geckos, in Isabela is a particular cause for concern. So far, however, it is not clear whether this species has become established on Isabela and it is not yet known from other islands within the Galápagos. Only three islands within this lizard's range are inhabited and at risk from introduced geckos, however, these are the larger islands where it occurs and may potentially lead to substantial declines in the global population.","This species is common in areas where invasive geckos are absent, and on islands where introduced gecko&#160;species are absent. Two species of invasive gecko have been present since the 1970s, and while the native can still be found in disturbed areas where the introduced geckos thrive, they are less common than they used to be, and than the novel species (Hoogmoed 1989). The recent introduction of <em>Hemidactylus frenatus </em>to Isabela (from where it was first reported in 2011 - Torres-Carvajal and Tapia 2011) is likely to lead to further declines, and both this species and <em>Phyllodactylus reissi</em>, which resemble Galápagos geckos in their ecological adaptations, have the potential to expand outside urban areas to cause declines in this lizard in its natural habitats (Hoogmoed 1989). Since Hoogmoed (1989) made this observation, there is no evidence that <em>P. reissi</em> has colonized natural habitats, although it can be found at the border of disturbed and natural areas (A.

54010576,54010476,Leopardus guttulus,Vulnerable,C1,2016,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Leopardus guttulus</em> has only recently been acknowledged as a valid species, separate from the former <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em>, due to their genetic uniqueness and differences (Trigo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a). Its current northern limits of geographic distribution are still unclear, but show a large extent of occurrence of <em>ca</em>. 3,287,075 km². However, its area of occupancy (AOO) is rather limited and within the threatened Cerrado and Atlantic Forest domains. Considering all available natural habitat in its entire range, the maximum AOO possible would be of only 473,254 km². Additionally, given the level of fragmentation and the very small size of some patches, it is very unlikely that the Southern Tiger Cat would be present in some parts of this remaining area. Besides, no single species occupies all natural areas within its geographic range. Therefore its actual AOO would be much lower than the estimates presented here. The species is almost always found at low/very low population densities (0.01–0.05/km² or lower), especially in protected areas, given the negative impact it suffers from Ocelots (‘ocelot effect’ – Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em> </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, most of the population probably occurs outside protected areas, in places under severe pressure from land development/habitat conversion. A population decline in the past few years has also been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, the estimated density dropped from 0.25/km<sup>2</sup> to 0.13/km<sup>2</sup> by almost 50% from 2005 to 2013/14, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013, Kasper<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2016, M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). If this decline continues, a population reduction of 80% would be expected in three generations (15 years) in this area. In another area the estimated density dropped by over 50% from 0.2/km<sup>2 </sup>to &lt;0.1/km<sup>2</sup> from 2008 to 2015, resulting in a population reduction of over 7%/year. If this decline continues, the population would disappear in 3 generations in this area. Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, MMA/IBAMA 2011). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012, R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comm.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between <em>L. guttulus</em> and <em>Leopardus geoffroyi</em> on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the southern tiger cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2008, 2013a). <br/><br/><br/>A declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of <em>L. guttulus</em> was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (AOO) and typical lower population densities (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em> </em>2010, 2013). Given the likely overestimation of the AOO, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. Based on the observed continuing decline in mature individuals of 50% and more in two important conservation areas for <em>Leopardus guttulus</em> a continuing decline of over 10% over 15 years (= three generations) can be estimated. Due to its low estimated population size of less than 10,000 mature individuals and the high observed population reductions, the species may even qualify for Endangered in the near future.","The Southern Tiger Cat inhabits a broad variety of habitats. These range from dense tropical and subtropical rainforests, deciduous/semideciduous, and mixed pine forests, to the open savannahs, and beach vegetation, both pristine and disturbed (Tortato and Oliveira 2005; Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, 2013; Oliveira 2011). In the Pantanal (wet/swampy savannah) it is extremely rare and has been recorded only in the dry savannahs, not in the marshy areas. Although the Southern Tiger Cat can also inhabit disturbed formations, its occurrence near agricultural fields is, nevertheless, limited by the presence of natural cover. Thus, restricted to mosaics of forest or savannah and small-scale agriculture. In these areas, both telemetry information and scat analysis indicates that it uses the natural formations and does not venture deep into the agricultural areas <em>per se</em>, but only on its borders, taking advantage of the high rodent densities (Facure-Giaretta 2002, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The species is mostly found in lowland areas, reaching up to 2,000 m above sea level.<br/><br/>Litter size is usually one, sometimes two (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Diel activity pattern is predominantly nocturno-crepuscular, but with considerable amount of daytime activity. This activity during any time of the day is suggested to be a strategy to avoid predation by the larger sympatric Ocelot (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Prey base consists mostly of small mammals, birds and lizards, with average prey size at &lt;100 g, but does include larger sized prey (&gt;1 kg) (Facure-Giaretta 2002, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Tortato 2009, Trigo&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013b). The limited information on home ranges shows that it is 2.5 times larger than they would be expected, based on the cat’s body size. This may be another consequence to avoid other larger and potential felid predators. Known home ranges for the Southern Tiger Cat range from 2 to 25 km² (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010).","The Southern Tiger Cat was heavily exploited for the fur trade decades ago, following the decline in Ocelot trade. Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. A population decline in the past few years has been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, where the density estimates dropped by more than 50%, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2013; M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, <span style="""">MMA/IBAMA 2011</span>). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012; R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comms.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between <em>L. guttulus</em> and <em>Leopardus geoffroyi</em> on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the Southern Tiger Cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Trigo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013a).","<em>Leopardus guttulus</em>&#160;population densities vary, but tend to be low throughout most of its range especially in regard to what would be expected of such a small cat species. Given its body size, expected density would be 91/100 km².&#160;&#160;Population densities of <em>L. guttulus</em> vary from one to 25/100 km². It is generally around 1-5/100 km² (or even lower) in most of its area of occupancy but can get to 13-25/100 km² in a few isolated high density areas (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Higher densities are attained only where Ocelots are absent or very rare. Where Ocelots are common or attain densities of 10/100 km² or higher, the Southern Tiger Cat is extremely rare and is expected to reach numbers much lower than 1-5/100 km². Thus, the Southern Tiger Cat is negatively impacted by Ocelots by interspecific killing due to potential for competition in what is known as the “Ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).<br/><br/>The state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil has been considered the most important area for <em>Leopardus guttulus</em> conservation and thus to harbour the best and likely most viable population. This is due to the extent of the state’s remaining Atlantic Forest, level of connectivity and the cat’s presence in reasonable numbers in local Conservation Units due in most part to the absence of Ocelots (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Nevertheless, previous high densities found in some areas there (25/100 km²) seemed to have dropped to 13/100 km² or 7/100 km² in the past few years, likely as a consequence of natural rodent reduction (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, M. Tortato pers. comm.). Therefore, expected higher densities of this species might be lower than previously thought. Considering all remaining area of natural habitat there and the species densities recorded, population size in Santa Catarina is expected to be around 1,500–2,800 (more likely towards the lower limit). Elsewhere, population reductions of <em>ca</em>. 67% have been observed due to an increase in number of Ocelots (Oliveira 2011, Marques 2013). At other areas, reductions from 20-24/100 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 8/100km<sup>2</sup>&#160;have also been noted (Oliveira 2011, Kasper <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2015), but not as a consequence of the Ocelot effect.<br/><br/>Likely as a consequence of the Ocelot effect, <em>L. guttulus</em> is found mostly outside protected areas of two of South America’s most threatened biomes, the highly fragmented Atlantic Forest, whose natural cover remaining is around 8% and the savannahs, whose remaining area is &lt;40%. In this way, conservation efforts should focus outside protected areas.<br/><br/>A declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of <em>L. guttulus</em> was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (AOO) and typical lower population densities (Oliveira 2011; Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, 2013). Given the likely overestimation of the AOO, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. A future decline of 10–30% over the next 15-18 years (= three generations) is projected due to declining AOO (habitat loss) and habitat quality. Even though the Southern Tiger Cat is found in several protected areas, no conservation units within the species’ range in Brazil or elsewhere are expected to house 500 individuals, most far below 200 (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",Decreasing,"The Southern Tiger Cat ranges from Central to southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina in the Provinces of Misiones and Corrientes. The species is absent from the Paraguayan Chaco. The northern limits of its geographic range are still unclear. It reaches Central Brazil in the states of Minas Gerais, Goiás, the border area of the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul state, and the Atlantic Forest area of eastern Bahia in the northeast region (T. de Oliveira pers. comm.). Whether it overlaps with <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>and to what extent is still unclear.

This species is Vulnerable in Argentina – still under <em>L. tigrinus</em> (Diaz and Ojeda 2000) and Brazil (MMA 2014). Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, probably because of the impact of the higher Ocelot densities and, as such, conservation efforts will have to focus outside protected areas (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008, Oliveira 2011).

At present the population is probably not severely fragmented as the species still occurs in high densities on the largest of the four islands within its range; on similar grounds population declines are unlikely to have been in excess of 80% over a 10 year period, and as such it is not listed as Critically Endangered.","This species occurs in mesic habitats, where it is found under rocks and leaf litter (Schwartz and Henderson 1991); it has also been found in coastal dry forest (R. Gomès pers. comm. 2016). The most important subpopulation occurs within 20 m of the shore, and has been found in sea grape leaf litter which retains moisture well and may improve habitat quality for this species. Behind the mangrove zone the species is present, but at much lower densities (Breuil 2002).","This species occurs in a remote archipelago. Mangrove habitat is very limited as a result of coastal resort development, however, it is unknown whether this species is dependent on mangrove vegetation or simply requires low elevations. Under French law the littoral zone in the French Antilles is protected. Goats and feral chickens are both widespread on the islands where this species occurs (R.&#160;Gomès pers. comm. 2015); these are hypothesized to be the major drivers of the observed recent decline. This is particularly true of goats as overgrazing removes the leaf litter these geckos apparently favour, and has been directly implicated in forest degradation in this area (R. Gomès pers. comm. 2016). Recent observations from Saintes add support to the idea that this species persists only in areas with significant leaf litter; few suitable areas survive on Saintes and two of the three sites surveyed by R. Gomès are inland sites (1.4 km from the shore) that do not benefit from the protection of the littoral zone (R. Gomès unpubl. data). Predation on a small lizard, apparently a gecko, by chickens has also been observed (R. Gomès pers. obs.); this is thought to be the main driver of declines on Îlet Cabrit (B. Angin unpubl. data).","Densities of 2-3 individuals per 10 m<sup>2</sup> have been recorded on Grand Ilet; densities are reportedly similar at Crawen on Terre-de-Haut (Breuil 2002). &#160;In litter near mangroves on Grand Ilet, densities as high as 0.79 per m<sup>2</sup>&#160;were reported by Breuil (2002). This author estimates an overall population on Grand Ilet between 50-100,000 individuals.<br/><br/>Based on these figures and the results of more recent surveys of all the islands within its range (including targeted surveys of sites surveyed by Breuil - R. Gomès and B. Angin unpubl. data 2016), which have recorded only ""very low densities"" or no geckos at all save Grand Ilet (R. Gomès and B. Angin unpubl. data 2016), this species has declined dramatically over the past two decades. On Grand Ilet, where high densities were reported by Breuil (2002), surveys in 2016 have recorded it in ""medium"" densities (B. Angin unpubl. data). This worker found only a few individuals under stones on Ilet Cabrit, where the species formerly occurred in high densities, and many stones needed to be turned to obtain records (B. Angin unpubl. data).<br/><br/>At a specific site where Breuil observed high densities in the early 2000s, the species was not found at all (R.&#160;Gomès pers. comm. 2016). Where it survives, it is found in considerably lower densities than <em>Sphaerodactylus fantasticus</em> (R. Gomès, pers. comm. 2016).

On Nihoa the main foods include small beetles, spiders, roaches and larvae (Morin <em>et al.</em> 1997, MacDonald 2012). The original, naturally occurring Laysan population was thought to have fed primarily on moths (Henshaw 1902), however, the species is thought to be a catholic feeder, feeding on the most readily available arthropod prey items (MacDonald 2012). Forthcoming results of research will include a comparison of potential Millerbird prey on Nihoa and Laysan islands (M.A. MacDonald <em>in prep.</em>). Pairs show year-to-year fidelity in specific territories, with nesting apparently correlated with precipitation and most breeding taking place in the winter months (peaking January-March), although the breeding period may be extended in years of high summer rainfall (MacDonald 2012).

These may have been caused by  climatic events, anthropogenic influences (impacts of Nihoa's prehistoric human population, and perhaps of modern introduction of nonnative plants and insects) or other stochastic fluctuations in habitat and consequently in population size. The Millerbird's extinction on Laysan in the early 20th century was ultimately caused by the introduction of rabbits and livestock, which denuded the island of vegetation (severe declines in the species's invertebrate prey and suitable habitat). On Nihoa, the population size is probably regulated primarily by precipitation levels, which affect the abundance of arthropod prey (extended droughts for example, are likely to have a negative impact).  Severe weather events such as hurricanes may cause direct mortality of Millerbirds; a single severe storm could extinguish the entire population (USFWS 1984)<strong></strong>. Since  the species has an extremely  small range and has severely low levels  of genetic diversity, it is particularly vulnerable to extinction  through exposure to disease. Population outbreaks of the nonnative grasshoppers (e.g. the Gray Bird Grasshopper<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span><em>Schistocerca nitens</em>) have periodically denuded  90% of the island's vegetated area, especially the shrubs in which  Millerbirds nest. Outbreaks such as these may have been responsible for  reductions in the  bird population to well below 200 individuals in  1994, 1996, and 2005 (<a style="""" class=""ref"">Latchininsky 2008</a>).

The most recent estimate of the nascent population on Laysan was 164 in September 2014 (Dalton <em>et al.</em> 2014, Freifeld <em>et al. </em>2016). Considering that the Nihoa subpopulation fluctuates&#160;widely, the band 250-999 mature individuals seems appropriate. This estimate equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Stable,"<em>Acrocephalus familiaris</em> is endemic to the steep, rocky island of Nihoa in the north-western Hawaiian Islands, <strong>U.S.A.</strong> It previously occurred on Laysan also, where the nominate race was estimated to number 1,500 birds in 1915, but became extinct between 1916 and 1923. On Nihoa, monitoring methods used from 1967 to 2014, and data recorded intermittently since the late 1960s, did not yield precise population estimates or trends for this species (Morin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Gorresen <em>et al. </em>2012, Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2016)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. However, the existing data do suggest that Millerbird numbers on Nihoa have experienced pronounced fluctuations and have likely ranged between fewer than 50 and more than 800 individuals (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2016)<strong></strong>. The last estimates using these methods were 468 ± 166 (SD) individuals in September 2013 and 893 ± 303 (SD) in September 2014 (Gorresen <em>et al. </em>2016). Wide fluctuations have had a significant impact on the genetic diversity of the remaining population, with the effective number of breeders being estimated as between 5 and 13 individuals (using samples collected in 2007 and 2009 [Addison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011]). The vegetated area of Nihoa is just 61.9 ha (86% of the island; Gorresen <em>et al</em>. 2012), and Millerbirds are distributed relatively evenly across the island, with some areas of slightly higher densities (MacDonald 2012, Gorresen <em>et al</em>. 2016). Conservation translocations were undertaken in September 2011 and August 2012, when a total of 50 Millerbirds were moved from Nihoa to Laysan, a distance of 1,037 km (Freifeld <em>et al.</em> 2016). The birds began breeding successfully within six months of the first release. Based on post-release monitoring through 2014, the nascent population on Laysan was estimated at 164 birds (Dalton <em>et al. </em>2014, Freifeld <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>Nihoa is part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (H.

However, monitoring and study on Laysan has become far more challenging since the closure of the long-term, year-round USFWS field camp on the island in 2013. Continue to monitor Nihoa for the highly invasive plant <em>Cenchrous echinatus </em>that was re-discovered in September 2011, and continue to monitor and manage invasive alien plants on Laysan (e.g., Morin and Conant 1998).

Population information is limited for this species and data are mostly available from catch records off Iran where catches have increased overall&#160;in the most recent 10 years available (2008 - 2017) but have stabilized in the most recent five years. Since the accidental introduction of <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>&#160;in the late 1990s, the abundance of <em>C. engrauliformis </em>and <em>C. grimmi </em>has declined substantially and this species has become the most abundant species of Kilka in the Caspian Sea. This species is not as negatively impacted by <em>M. leidyi</em>&#160;as the other two species of Kilka because it has a slightly different ecology, such as spawning seasonality and a wider diet preference. However, since the drastic declines in abundance of <em>C. engrauliformis </em>and <em>C. grimmi</em>, fishing effort for this species has remained relatively stable in the most recent decade; however, biomass estimates have declined in the most recent eight years available, and despite stable catches, it is currently considered to be overexploited in Iran. Species-specific conservation measures are not in place; however, recommendations to protect and monitor all species of <em>Clupeonella </em>in the Caspian Sea have been suggested, including increased population monitoring and coordinated international efforts. Given that this species is currently widely distributed in the Caspian Sea and abundant throughout a majority of its range, <em>Clupeonella caspia</em>&#160;is listed as Least Concern. Increased population monitoring of this species' abundance and fishing effort is highly recommended to detect potential population declines.","<p></p><p>This is a pelagic, euryhaline, schooling species that is known to tolerate marine, estuarine and freshwater environments (Prikhod'ko 1981, Kottelat and Freyhof 2007, Fazli <em>et al.</em> 2007, Coad 2017). The recent observed sea level rise in the Caspian Sea in the most recent 10 – 20 years, has expanded suitable habitat for this species (Mamedov 2006). It is known to a maximum longevity of 6 years (Kottelat and Freyhof 2007). In Azerbaijan, individuals are estimated to reach maturity by the age of 1 (Mamedov 2006) and is known to spawn in open water and near river mouths in the late evening in the Spring from April to July throughout its range (Prikhod'ko 1981, Kottelat and Freyhof 2007, Fazli <em>et al.</em> 2007).&#160;This species presumably&#160;does not migrate long distances but does move between feeding grounds in the summer and winter, and spawning grounds in the spring and early summer (Coad 2017). It has pelagic eggs that are usually released in water at about 5 metres depth with a salinity of 0.02 - 15 ‰ (Kottelat and Freyhof 2007). Larvae and juveniles remain in shallow water while adults may form schools at deeper depths (30 - 40 metres) in the winter (Coad 2017). This species feeds on zooplanktonic crustaceans (e.g., copepods, mysids) and follows a daily vertical migration moving to surface waters at night and descending to deeper depths in the daylight (Kottelat and Freyhof 2007). In Iran, this species reaches a maximum known standard length of 14.5 cm and a maximum known weight of 19.0 g (Coad 2017).&#160;&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>This species, similar to the other species of&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2;text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial;text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing: 0px"">Clupeonella</em>, faces several distinct threats, mostly including impacts from fishing pressure and to a lesser extent, from the invasive ctenophore, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi. </em>Mamedov (2006) reported that the arrival of&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2; text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing:0px"">M. leidyi</em>&#160;resulted in a decreased biomass of zooplankton, the main food resource of this species of&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2; text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing:0px"">Clupeonella</em>, which dropped by a factor of 4–10 between 2000 and 2003. The reproductive biology of this species is different than the other two Kilka species (<em>C. engrauliformis</em> and <em>C. grimmi</em>), which provides some protection from the competition with and predation by <em>M. leidyi </em>(Kideys 2001,&#160;Shiganova&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2; text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing:0px"">et al.</em>&#160;2004, Mamedov 2006, Fazli&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2;text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial;text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing: 0px"">et al</em>.&#160;2017). For example, the northern stock of this species spawns in the Spring when <em>M. leidyi </em>is absent; the southern stock spawns during the coldest time period (between January and February) when <em>M. leidyi </em>biomass and feeding activity is low (Bogutskaya and Naseka 2013, Aladin&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2; text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing:0px"">et al.&#160;</em>2018).</p>  <p>Contrary to the other two Kilka species, the rising sea level observed in the most recent two decades is advantageous to this species as it has expanded the suitable habitat of this species (Mamedov 2006).</p>  <p>Fishing effort for this species has increased substantially since the early 2000s after the introduction of <em>M. leidyi</em> and subsequent decline in abundance of the other two Kilka species. Currently, this species is overexploited in Iranian waters (Aliasghari&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2;text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial;text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing: 0px"">et al</em>.&#160;2017, Janbaz 2019) and the estimated rate of exploitation has remained relatively stable in the southern Caspian Sea since 2010 at approximately 0.55 (Karimzadeh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Janbaz 2019). Although the biomass of <em>C. caspia</em>&#160;has declined from 120,000 tonnes in 2010 to about 80,000 tonnes in 2017 (Janbaz 2019), catches of this species have stabilized in the most recent five years available in in Iranian waters (IFO 2018). Given that Kilka species overall, including <em>C. caspia</em>,<em>&#160;</em>have a history of being overexploited throughout the entire range in the Caspian Sea and that biomass estimates from Iran have declined in recent years (~33%) despite stabilized catches in that region during the same time period, there should be some concern regarding the population status of this species. Continued intensive population monitoring of this species (<em>C. caspia</em>) as well as the other two species of Kilka (<em>C. engrauliformis</em> and <em>C. grimmi</em>) is highly recommended.&#160;</p>","<p><strong><u>Status of Kilka in&#160;the Caspian Sea</u></strong></p>  <p>The majority of fisheries landings in the Caspian Sea are attributable to Kilka, the most abundant fishes in the region (Fazli <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009), which includes&#160;<em>Clupeonella caspia, C. engrauliformis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. grimmi</em>. Historically, the majority of Kilka landings were represented by&#160;<em>C. engrauliformis</em>, with less than 20 % in contribution by&#160;<em>C. caspia</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. grimmi&#160;</em>(Fazli&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Janbaz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Falahatkar 2015, Coad 2017). Annual harvest of total Kilka catch has shown some fluctuations over time, but overall show a declining trend with evidence to support overexploitation from the majority of its range, including Iran (Fazli and Taghavi Jelodar 2013) and Azerbaijan (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007).</p>  <p>Globally, lumped landings of species of&#160;<em>Clupeonella</em>&#160;are reported to the FAO in appreciable quantities (averaging roughly 256,000 tonnes per year: FAO 2016); however, we have been unable to determine the extent this species is included in reported landings. Annual catch of three clupeoid species including&#160;<em>C. caspia</em>&#160;reached a maximum of 423,000 metric tons in 1970, which accounted for roughly 70% of the total fish catch in the Caspian Sea. Overexploitation and the expansion of the invasive ctenophore,&#160;<em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, in the early 2000’s resulted in major declines in total biomass and catch of Kilka, as well as a change in the relative abundance of the three species (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007, Fazli&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Fazli <em>et al. </em>2009, Aliasghari&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Fazli <em>et al. </em>2020).</p>  <p>For example, total catch in 1999 peaked at 271,400 tonnes and fishing mortality reached 1.8 y<sup>-1&#160;</sup>indicating overexploitation (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007).</p>  <p>Additionally, more recent studies from Iran indicate that this species&#160;is now considered to be the most common Kilka in the Caspian Sea (Karimzadeh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Parafkandeh Haghighi and Kaymaram 2012, Janbaz 2019), accounting for 95.5% of catches in 2017, whereas&#160;<em>C. engrauliformis&#160;</em>(previously the most abundant) recently represented roughly 3.5% and&#160;<em>C. grimmi</em>&#160;represented 1.0% in 2017 (Janbaz 2019).&#160;</p><p>Furthermore, biomass of all species of&#160;<em>Clupeonella&#160;</em>declined by a factor a three in Russia, Iran and Azerbaijan between 2000 and 2001, with larger declines seen in 2002 (Shiganova&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004).<strong>&#160;</strong>By 2002,&#160;<em>M. leidyi</em>&#160;reached critical biomass levels in important commercial areas jeopardizing fishing industries in the Caspian Sea, including Kilka, which was the main commercial fishery for all Caspian countries (Shiganova&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).<strong>&#160;</strong>Kilka<em>&#160;</em>abundance in Iranian waters declined from roughly 10 – 15 % to 0 – 2 % and fisheries collapsed by approximately 50% in 2 - 3 years following the introduction of&#160;<em>M. leidyi</em>&#160;(Daskalov and Mamedov 2007, Coad 2017).</p>  <p><strong>Azerbaijan</strong></p>  <p>In Azerbaijan, total Kilka catches declined from 18,500 – 5,100 tonnes (2000 – 2004) representing a 72% decrease in 5 years (Mamedov 2006). Recruitment failure in 2001 has been attributed to the invasion and spread to the ctenophore&#160;<em>Mnemiopsis leidyi&#160;</em>(Daskalov and Mamedov 2007) and resulted in an increase in the average age of Kilka stock and a large decline in total Kilka abundance (Mamedov 2006).</p>  <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>  <p>The vast majority of available data regarding the status of Kilka in the Caspian Sea refer to Iranian waters, which likely represents less than 50% of all Kilka in the Caspian Sea. However, there is no reason to believe that it is not representative of the entire region.&#160;Since 1999, total landings of Kilka in Iran have declined from 95,000 (Fazli, 2011) to 22,602 tonnes in 2017, representing an approximate 76.2% overall (IFO 2018).</p>  <p>Additionally, changes to biological characteristics of all species of Kilka,&#160;especially&#160;<em>C. engrauliformis</em><em>,&#160;</em>were reported in areas impacted by&#160;<em>M. leidyi&#160;</em>(Parafkandeg Haghighi and Kaymaram 2012) including a sharp decrease in weight, length and condition individuals (Shiganova&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004).&#160;</p>  <p><strong><u>Specific information regarding the status of the Common Kilka,&#160;<em>Clupeonella caspia</em></u></strong></p>  <p>This species is reported as abundant along the shores of the northern and western Caspian Sea (Kottelat and Freyhof 2007).</p>  <p><strong>Azerbaijan</strong></p>  <p>The relatively recent (past 20 years) observed sea level rise in the Caspian Sea has reportedly expanded suitable habitat for this species and catches of this species now account for roughly 14 – 29% of total Kilka catch in Azerbaijan waters, compared to less than 1% in the 1970s (Mamedov 2006). </p>  <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>  <p>Species-specific population data are primarily available from Iran, where <em>C. caspia</em> has increased in abundance in recent years. Overexploitation of Kilka stocks and the introduction of <em>M. leidyi</em> in 1999 resulted in major reported declines in biomass, catch and CPUE of the two other Kilka species, <em>C. grimmi</em> and <em>C. engrauliformis</em>. However, this species has not been as negatively impacted by the invasive ctenophore as the other two species of Kilka given a slightly different ecology, such as spawning and feeding behavior and seasonality (Karpyuk <em>et al.</em> 2004,<strong> </strong>Bogutskaya and Naseka 2013, Aladin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Therefore, catches of this species, <em>C. caspia,</em> have increased in recent years from less than 1% in the 1990s to more than 95% of current total Kilka catch, making this the most commonly caught Kilka (Karimzadeh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Aliasghari&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Janbaz 2019).&#160;In the most recent 10 years available (2008 – 2017) catches of this species in Iran have increased from roughly 16,006 tonnes in 2008 to 22,602 tonnes in 2017 (41% increase),&#160;but have remained stable in the most recent five years (IFO<em>&#160;</em>2018). Within the same 10 year time window, this species has represented between 95 and 99% of total Iranian Kilka catches (Janbaz 2019).&#160;</p><p>Given the substantial declines in abundance of the other two Kilka species within the Caspian Sea, effort for this species has increased in the most recent 20 years (Karimzaheh <em>et al. </em>2010). Therefore, increasing catches may not truly represent an increase in abundance of this species. The biomass of <em>C. caspia </em>increased from about 25,000 tonnes in 1997 to near 120,000 tonnes in 2010, but declined to about 80,000 tonnes in 2017 (Janbaz 2019), which represents over a 2-fold increase overall, but a decline in biomass of approximately 33% in the most recent 8 years. Despite that this species is not as negatively impacted by the invasive ctenophore relative to the other two Kilka species, Kilka overall, have a history of being overexploited throughout the entire range in the Caspian Sea, and therefore, there is some concern regarding the true population status of this species in light of increased fishing pressure.&#160;</p>",Unknown,"This species is distributed in the Caspian Sea and the lower reaches of Volga, Ural and possibly Terek (Kottelat and Freyhof 2007). It is known to occupy a depth range between 0 - 100 metres but can be commonly found at depths less than 50 - 70 metres (Coad 2017).","<p>This species supports major commercial fisheries throughout many regions of the Caspian Sea. This species is caught at nighttime using underwater electric lights and fish pumps (Fazli&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Aliasghari&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2017).&#160;<br/> <br/> Azerbaijan is traditionally the most important area for commercial capture of Kilka species in the Caspian Sea (Mamedov 2006). This species is mostly targeted in the southwestern part of the Caspian sea around the Borisov shoal at depths of&#160; 30–56 m (1.5–3%) and over the Kornilov - Pavlov shoal at depths of 46–97 m (1.5–3.5%: Mamedov 2006).<br/> <br/> In Iran, this species is commercially targeted; catches of all Kilka species are mainly concentrated along the Babolsar and Anzali coasts (Fazli&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2007, Parafkandeh Haghighi and Kaymaram 2012). Previously in 2008, this species was considered to be overexploited in the southern Caspian Sea with an estimated exploitation rate at 0.55 (Karimzadeh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). More recently, the exploitation rate for this species was again estimated to be 0.55 in the southern Caspian Sea and is considered to be overexploited (Janbaz 2019).&#160;</p><p>In general, this species is used in local fishmeal industries of Iran. It is also consumed smoked, salted, canned in sauce and oil, and well as marinated, according to a traditional recipe and seasoned with fruits, herbs and vegetables (Alavi-Yegaheh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"No known species-specific conservation measures are in place. In a report prepared for the Caspian Environment Programme in 2001, suggestions of fishing limitations, lab studies and monitoring were made as measures to combat the&#160;<em>Mnemiopsis</em>&#160;problem. Aliasghari&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(2017) recommends the increased attention, effort and monitoring of population levels, fishing pressure and influence of&#160;<em>M. leidyi&#160;</em>on <em>C. grimmi</em>. Further recommendations have been made for increased coordinated international effort needed to implement immediate management of Kilka stocks in the Caspian Sea (Fazli&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009, Fazli and Taghavi Jelodar 2013).&#160;It has also been suggested that all catches of the three species of&#160;<em>Clupeonella&#160;</em>must be restricted during spawning periods (Fazli and Taghavi Jelodar 2013). Given that the most recent (2020) biomass estimates of the other two species of Kilka (<em>C. engrauliformis</em> and <em>C. grimmi</em>) have declined substantially over the past 20 years (&gt; 95%) in Iranian waters (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2020), there is concern for the population status of this species (<em>C. caspia</em>).

Its future on one island, in particular, is precarious, and the overall population trend is uncertain. The discovery of a relatively large population on Fogo, where it occurs commonly in plantations and crops, suggests that it may be less threatened than previously feared, and a re-assessment of its extent of occurrence using a minimum convex polygon means that the species now warrants listing as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","Its original habitat was probably scrub on mountain slopes and reedbeds in valleys (Hazevoet 1993)<strong></strong>.

Hazevoet <em>in litt. </em>2000)<strong></strong>. This is almost certainly the cause of its decline on São Nicolau and extinction from Brava, where continuing desiccation has restricted agricultural productivity (Hazevoet 1993)<strong></strong>. In addition, disease and enviromental catastrophies are potential threats to these island populations (Hazevoet <em>et al.</em> 1999). A recent forest fire on Fogo destroyed a large part of inaccessible forest where the species possibly existed (H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016), and so forest fires, and any future increase in fire frequency could be very harmful to this species. The removal of invasive plant species, such as reed removal by farmers on S. Nicolau, could possibly reduce the available habitat for this species in areas where there is no natural habitat (H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016). There is suspicion that it may be predated by birds (e.g. kestrel, crows), possibly rats and even humans (H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><p></p>","The population was estimated at c.500 pairs in the early 1990s, and was thought to number 1,000-1,500 birds based on its known range in 2007 (C. J. Hazevoet <em>in litt.</em> 2007). However, conservative estimates of 500 pairs on Fogo mean that the total population is likely to be higher, likely numbering 1,500-2,000 mature individuals, roughly equivalent to 2,200-3,000 individuals in total. &#160;Full censuses were never carried on Fogo or Santiago. The numbers on Santiago could be higher than previously thought because the bird is now known to occur in all vegetated areas of the island, whereas in the 1990s it was thought to be absent from the north of the island (H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016). On Fogo, a volcanic eruption in 2014 does not seem to have affected the extent of area occupied by the bird, but the bird is absent from areas where it had been previously found on the forest of Monte Velha following the forest fire of 2015. However, the size of the birds’ territories is unknown, and could be larger than in closely related species; this means that the numbers estimated based on replies to playbacks may or may not correspond to the actual numbers (in recent surveys, the same colour-ringed bird replied to playback lures from locations that could have considered two adjacent territories [H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016]). Surveys on S. Nicolau in three occasions in 2014 and 2016 found 12 – 13 territories each time, and the real number is not likely to be much higher. &#160;There are probably a minimum of 20 birds and a maximum of 50 on that island.",Unknown,"<em>Acrocephalus brevipennis</em> was once believed to be confined to Santiago, <strong>Cape Verde Islands</strong>, where it was though to be locally distributed. It has most likely died out on Brava (no records since 1969 and formerly scarce) and was believed to have died out on São Nicolau (where it was formerly numerous). However, a previously unreported specimen collected on São Nicolau in October 1970 was discovered in the collection of the Centro de Zoologia, Lisbon, providing the impetus for a thorough search of the island (Hazevoet 1999a)<strong></strong> and, in 1998, surveys located eight territories confined to the north-west of the island (though its long-term prospects for survival here are poor) (Hazevoet <em>et al.</em> 1999). In October 2004 a population was discovered on Fogo, and it has since been found to be widespread across the northern half of the island between 200-975 m, with the total population on the island conservatively estimated at 500 pairs (Hering and Hering 2005, Hering and Fuchs 2009).

Nicolau). Currently, the bird is known to be absent from Brava and Santo Antão (Batalha <em>et al. </em>2016); anectodal reports could not be verified despite extensive searches and could have consisted of vagrant birds (H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016). On Fogo, it can be found in densely vegetated areas between 299 and 1384m, including coffee plantations, inaccessible ravines covered in invasive<em> Lantana camara</em> and <em>Furcrarea spp</em>., and the forest of Monte Velha (Batalha <em>et al.</em> unpublished data). On Santiago, it can be found in densely vegetated areas across the island, between 6 and 1,039 m, and in various habitats, from lowland plantations (e.g., Praia, Cidade Velha, Chão Bom, Achada Tenda, Pedra Babejo) to mountain forests (Serra Malagueta and Monte Tchota), and sugar cane plantations in Praia to <em>Prosopis spp.</em> shrub thickets in Tarrafal (Batalha<em> et al.</em> unpublished data). On S. Nicolau, however, territories seem to be confined to a central humid area comprising part of the Natural Park of Monte Gordo and the valleys of Queimadas, Fragata and Covoada, between 162 and 733m (Batalha <em>et al. </em>unpublished data). Extensive, thorough surveys located only 12-13 confirmed territories, either in reed patches or mango trees, so the actual number is not likely to be higher than 20-30 in the entire island of S.

The bird is not present either in the forest of Monte Gordo, on the plantations of Fajã or in the far-east <em>Prosopis spp.</em> thicket of Carriçal (Batalha <em>et al. </em>unpublished data).

This may involve investigating the species’s association with dams, which are currently being built on several locations on Santiago, and its association&#160;with invasive plant species (e.g.,&#160;<em>Lantana, Furcrarea, Arundo, Prosopis spp.</em>); which should be considered when planning conservation actions aimed at eradicating invasive species (as previously done on Natural Park of Serra Malagueta) (H.

Assess the benefits of a monitoring ringing plan, especially on the subpopulations that live within the limits of Natural Parks of Fogo, Serra Malagueta and Monte Gordo (H.

Reports of urban development resulting in the total loss of some populations is not uncommon throughout parts of their range and given the ongoing rapid economic growth along Australia's east coast, the trend is likely to continue. The only relatively safe populations are those present in National Park Estates, however, whilst protected from urban and rural development in these areas, increases in droughts and bushfires as a result of climate change also make these populations susceptible to extinction. This species has an area of occupancy (AOO) of 292 km<sup>2</sup> and the population is considered to be severely fragmented and experiencing continuing declines.","Oxleyan Pygmy Perch inhabit slightly acidic and tannin-stained water in slow flowing pools and backwaters in coastal streams, river channels, lakes and swampy drainages (NSW DPI 2005). Microhabitat selection is for areas where there is a high abundance of in-water structure such as emergent or submerged plants or steep undercut banks fringed by semi-submerged branches and fine rootlets from adjacent land-based trees and scrubs (Knight and Arthington 2008). A small-bodied and relatively short-lived species, Oxleyan&#160;Pygmy Perch has been recorded up to a maximum recorded length of 75 mm, and while its exact longevity is unknown, it is thought to only live to around five years of age (Allen <em>et al. </em>2002). Sexual maturation is reached at 4-5 months when they are around 25-30 mm in length. The species is a protracted serial spawner, with small batches of eggs and larvae produced continually during the breeding season. The breeding season extends from September through to April/May each year (Knight <em>et al.</em> 2007). Males display strong territoriality when breeding, aggressively defending nesting areas from conspecific males and other small-bodied fish species. Nesting areas are associated with aquatic vegetation in which pairs spawn. Eggs are around one mm in diameter&#160;and are demersal and slightly adhesive (Knight<em> et al. </em>2007). Hatching commences at around 50 hrs post-fertilisation, with larvae 2.8-3.4 mm at hatching. Larvae begin feeding exogenously at around day five when 3.9-4.5 mm in length, with full yolk-sac absorption complete by day eight at the earliest and day 12 at the latest (Knight <em>et al.</em> 2007).","Habitat loss and degradation is possibly the most immediate and ongoing threat for Oxleyan Pygmy Perch, with vast areas of wallum heath either gone, or for those areas that remain outside National Park estates, the risk of encroaching urban and rural development (NSW DPI 2005). Other pressures on habitat both past and present include; sand mining; drainage and rechannelling of natural waterways; man-made barriers to fish passage that have resulted in increased fragmentation of local populations; loss of riparian and other vegetation; pollution from urban, agricultural, industrial and recreational activities; bushfires and hazard reduction burning; and water extraction (Knight <em>et al. </em>2012). The other main threats are the interspecific competition from introduced species such as Eastern Gambusia (<em>Gambusia holbrooki</em>), and while impossible to estimate exact numbers, the illegal removal of potentially large numbers by aquarium collectors. A potentially insidious threat that again is difficult to quantify, is the threat to the genetic integrity of the species as a result of the populations continuing to fragment (Knight <em>et al. </em>2009).","Oxleyan&#160;Pygmy Perch&#160;has experienced significant range constriction and fragmentation as a result of anthropogenic influences (Allen <em>et al. </em>2002). The current population is divided into two clear groups; a southern group in NSW encompassing a number of fragmented populations in swamps, streams and lakes along the fringes of the coastline;&#160;and a northern group spread across south-east Queensland in similar mainland habitats, as well as on a number on sand islands adjacent to the coast. There is distinct genetic differentiation evident among the Queensland and NSW subpopulations which implies restricted gene flow between river systems and other habitats. However, one of the nine haplotypes detected was distributed over much of the species’ range, suggesting historical connectivity (Knight <em>et al. </em>2009).",Decreasing,"Oxleyan&#160;Pygmy Perch has a patchy and restricted distribution along the central region of Australia's east coast. It is found in coastal swamps, streams and lakes in lowland wallum heathlands from Tin Can Bay in south-east Queensland (Qld) in the north to Corindi in northern New South Wales (NSW) (Knight 2016). It is also present on a number of sand islands adjacent to the southern Qld coast; Fraser Island, Moreton and North Stradbroke Islands. This species has experienced significant range constriction and fragmentation as a result of urban development and associated loss of habitat (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2002). In NSW, the species is thought to have possibly been up to 200 km further south and up to 50 km further inland in the past compared to where it is now found (Knight 2016). The current distribution is also very disjunct, with no records across a 250 km stretch of coastline of the mainland in the middle of the current range between Rileys Hill in northern NSW and Deception Bay in south-eastern Qld (Knight 2016).",There is no legal trade of the species but it is illegally collected by aquarium collectors.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),Oxleyan Pygmy Perch is listed as endangered under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the NSW Fisheries Management Act 1994.

Its current AOO is 56 km<sup>2</sup>, but this is probably an underestimate of its actual AOO due to low levels of sampling. It is restricted to suitable habitat in a single river system; the Drysdale&#160;River Catchment where it is low to moderately abundant. </p>  <p>Habitat quality in this river system is declining due to invasive species (e.g. cattle), causing siltation. Furthermore, as&#160;<em>Syncomistes rastellus</em> has a specialised habitat and diet it is probably less resilient to environmental change (Clavel <em>et al</em>. 2011) .</p>  <br/><p></p>","Adults prefer deeper, slow flowing sections of rivers and streams in clear to turbid waters, but are also found in shallower habitats. They are generally found over rocky substrates with abundant algal cover. They are often associated with overhanging vegetation and snags. They have been observed schooling in the water column with <em>Syncomistes trigonicus</em>. Juveniles tend to be found in shallower slow flowing habitats as well as riffles. <em>Syncomistes rastellus </em>has been found inhabiting waters up to 34 degrees celsius (Le Feuvre 2017, Shelley <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>The diet of&#160;<em>Syncomistes rastellus</em>&#160;consists of algae and detritus. Juveniles are meiophagous omnivores and become algivore-detritivores as they grow. Algae and detritus is scraped off rocks and potentially captured from the water column with specialised teeth (Davis et al 2011, Le Feuvre 2017, Shelley <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<br/><br/><em>Syncomistes rastellus </em>attains sexual maturity at 7-8 cm and eggs are medium sized (approximately 2 mm) and non-adhesive. Breeding occurs over the wet season (generally December to March) (Shelley <em>et al</em>. 2018). This species has an average maximum thermal tolerance of ~37 degrees Celsius (Le Feuvre 2017).","<p>Current threats to <em>Syncomistes rastellus</em> include the following:</p>  <ul>  <li><strong>Damage to      riparian zones</strong>. Riparian zones in the Drysdale River are being      degraded by introduced species including cattle, horses, donkeys and pigs,      and altered fire regimes.&#160; Reduced      riparian habitat quality can reduce habitat and shelter for this species,      reduce water quality (including increased turbidity and siltation which may affect algal      growth, which forms the basis of <em>Syncomistes      rastellus’ </em>diet) and increase water temperatures. <em>Syncomistes rastellus</em> is often associated with overhanging      riparian vegetation and snags (Le Feuvre 2017), so reducing riparian      habitat quality may impact this species disproportionately.</li> </ul>  <p>Future threats to <em>Syncomistes rastellus</em> include the following:</p>  <ul>  <li><strong>Instream      barriers and flow modification</strong>. There is the potential      for water extraction and dam construction on the rivers of the Kimberley      to supply large-scale agricultural projects. Such developments impact      water availability and flow regimes Flow regimes play an important role in      life history of Australian freshwater fish, such as opening up floodplains      for breeding and feeding, providing vital nutrient inputs and increasing      migration. The Drysdale River has been earmarked as one potential site for      a major dam to supply water to a major agricultural development (Petheram      <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is unknown what the impacts of such developments may be      on <em>Syncomistes rastellus.</em></li>  <li><strong>Climate Change.      </strong>In general, Australian freshwater fish are thought to be resilient      to warming, as they have adapted to a highly variable climate      (Morrongiello <em>et al</em>. 2011), yet tropical species may be vulnerable to      climate change, as they may already approach their thermal limits during      hot, dry periods (Pusey <em>et al</em>. 2011, Burrows and Butler 2012). At      present, there is limited data on the thermal performance of northern      Australian freshwater fish to support this hypothesis (Burrows and Butler 2012). By 2090, air temperatures across northern Australia are      predicted to increase by up to 3.7°C and evapotransipiration by up to 10%,      depending on greenhouse gas emissions. There is low confidence in      predicted change in total rainfall across northern Australia, however      extreme rainfall events may become more intense (CSIRO and Bureau of      Meteorology 2015). Increased air temperature and reduced runoff will lead      to increased water temperatures (Webb <em>et al</em>. 2008); if tropical      freshwater fish are currently on the edge of their thermal limits and are      unable to rapidly adapt to warming climates (Donelson <em>et al</em>. 2011),      exploit thermal refuges or move to cooler regions, they will be vulnerable      to climate change. Evidence suggests that some Kimberley endemic      freshwater fishes may be somewhat resilient to increased water      temperatures while others currently live close to their thermal maxima. Thermal      tolerance experiments on <em>Syncomistes      rastellus </em>found that the species could tolerate temperatures up to 37.4      degrees. This is several degrees higher than the maximum water temperatures      currently experienced in the Drysdale River, so this species may have some      inherent resilience to climate change (Le Feuvre 2017). However it is      unclear how increased water temperatures will affect individual in the      long term, the survival of juveniles and reproductive output and other      ecological processes in this species. Nothing is known about their adaptive      capacity. It is likely that climate change has the capacity to impact this      species. </li>  <li><strong>Changed land      use, including agriculture development and resource extraction</strong>. Major      agricultural and resource extraction projects have the capacity to impact      aquatic environments by reducing water quality (e.g. increased      contaminants, nutrients, salinity and turbidity), affecting riparian      habitat and increase instream barriers and water extraction. The Drysdale River is relatively accessible and therefore is potentially vulnerable to changes in land use, including resource extraction and irrigated agriculture (Douglass 2013, Petheram <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is unclear      how reduced water quality will impact <em>Syncomistes      rastellus, </em>however it is likely that increased turbidity may reduce      predation success in this species. The impacts of reduced riparian habitat      quality and increased instream barriers and water extraction are covered      above.</li><li><strong>Alien species.</strong> Alien species have the capacity to greatly alter ecosystems via processes including direct and indirect predation and competition. While the Kimberley region is free from invasive aquatic species (except the Cane Toad), there is the potential for species to rapidly colonise the region. The Drysdale is relatively accessible, so human mediated introductions are possible.</li></ul>","<p>Current and predicted population trends are unknown.&#160;There is no quantitative analysis on the population size of <em>Syncomistes rastellus</em>, however it is recorded in low to moderate abundance where found (Le Feuvre 2017, Shelley <em>et al</em>. 2018).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>",Unknown,"This species is endemic to the Drysdale River in the Kimberley region of north-western Australia, where it covers almost the entire catchment (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Le Feuvre <em>et al</em>. 2016, Shelley <em>et al</em>. 2018).

Some of the lowland creeks have poor water quality owing to agriculture (tea, bananas and cane) and land clearing. Nothing is really known about its habitat requirements or preferences.&#160;Similarly, nothing is known about reproduction although it likely follows the typical rainbowfish pattern in the tropics (Pusey <em>et al.</em> 2001). Reproduction likely occurs throughout the year with peak predicted prior to the onset of the wet season.

It has a restricted distribution with an area of occupancy (AOO) of 1,512 km<sup>2 </sup>and there are continuing declines in habitat and the AOO due to the continued release of coldwater discharges from reservoirs, sedimentation of streams from unsealed roads and loss of riparian vegetation, which impact spawning and feeding habitats (meeting criterion B2b). However, the species is not severely fragmented and occurs at more than 10 locations so does not meet criterion B1a.","<em>Gadopsis bispinosus</em> is a demersal fish that is restricted to cool, clear, upland or montane streams with abundant instream cover, usually in the form of boulders and cobble.  It is often found in medium to large streams where there is lower stream velocity.   It is generally found in forested catchments, where there is little sediment input to the stream from erosion or land management practices (Sanger 1984, 1990; Koehn 1990; Lintermans 1998, 2007).  <br/><br/>It is a nocturnally active species which is usually solitary.  Juveniles are often found in large groups among leaf litter and wood debris.  Movements are restricted to a relatively small stretch of river over the duration of the life span; the home-range of adult fish is estimated at approximately 15-20 metres (Lintermans 1998, Broadhurst <em>et al. </em>2011<span style="""">).</span> The home range is larger in reservoirs (Broadhurst <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>Breeding is seasonal, with egg-laying commencing in October/November, probably induced by a relatively rapid rise in water temperature.  Fecundity is low and is positively correlated with fish length.  Females are though to commence breeding in their second or third year.  Between 80 and 420 eggs are laid in a single egg mass (Sanger 1990, Lintermans 1998). Spawning sites are on the underside of boulders (O'Connor and Zampatti 2006).","The major threat is sedimentation of streams which smothers food supplies and spawning sites (Lintermans 1998, 2012). Interactions with introduced fish species (such as trout) are also implicated in its decline, with the species now generally found in streams with complex substrates which may act as predation refuges. Trout are regularly recorded as preying on the species, with all life stages of blackfish vulnerable to trout predation (M. Lintermans unpublished data). Loss of flushing flows downstream of impoundments results in excessive sediment accumulation. In some locations, release of hypolimnetic water results in depressed water temperatures which delays spawning, and results in slower growth of juveniles, extending the period that they are exposed to predation from trout (Hall 2005). Clearing of riparian vegetation reduces shading on streams (affecting water temperatures) and also reduces the buffering of sediment input to streams. Populations can be affected by high levels of sedimentation after fires (Carey <em>et al.</em> 2003, Lyon and O'Connor 2008). Two-spined Blackfish were found dead alongside Brown Trout in the lower Howqua river during an extreme heat event in January 2019 (Jason Lieschke pers. comm.). This is believed to be a factor of high water temperatures and low dissolved oxygen levels.","This species was only described in 1984, and so historical distribution is largely inferred, but the species is considered to have had historical declines in population abundance or distribution in the ACT and surrounding NSW, determined from evidence based on direct observation, including a comparison of historical and current records (Lintermans 1998, ACT Government 1999). The species was formerly present in the Murrumbidgee and Paddys rivers in the ACT and possibly the Naas and Orroral rivers in the ACT in the 1940-60s (Greenham 1981, Lintermans 1998), but is now absent from these streams. The species has also been extirpated in the Cotter River downstream of Cotter Dam (Lintermans 1998). It&#160;is in relatively low abundance in the Goodradigbee River, Jounama Creek, and upper Murrumbidgee rivers in the Canberra region of NSW (M. Lintermans unpublished data), which is unusual as the species is normally abundant where it occurs (Sanger 1990). These low abundances suggest that population decline has occurred but historical population levels are unknown in these streams. In the upper Murrumbidgee River downstream of Tantangara Dam the species is now only present at a single site, and at that site was in very low abundance when last sampled in 1999, with extensive sediment accumulation noted as a result of the lack of flushing flows following construction of Tantangara. In some streams in the ACT and surrounding regions of NSW it is considered to still be relatively abundant including the Cotter River (ACT; Mountain Creek, Swampy Plain River, lower Geehi River, Micalong Creek; M. Lintermans unpublished data). In Victoria, the species is generally considered common in most sites, particularly some of the tributaries of Lake Eildon (Delatite, Howqua, Jamieson and upper Goulburn rivers).",Stable,"This species is endemic to south-eastern Australia.  Its distribution covers a narrow band from north-eastern Victoria, extending through south-eastern New South Wales (NSW) to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), which is at the northern extremity of its range (Lintermans 1998, ACT Government 1999).<br/><br/>An extensive survey of the NSW southern highlands (Lintermans 1998) located <em>G. bispinosus</em> in the following stream systems:<br/>- Upper Murray, including the lower reaches of the Swampy Plains, Tooma and Geehi Rivers;<br/>- Upper Tumut system, including the lower reaches of the Goobarragandra River;<br/>- Goodradigbee River and a tributary Micalong Creek;<br/>- Mountain Creek.<br/>A 1993 record from the Upper Murrumbidgee River between Yaouk and Adaminaby could not be located during further sampling in the mid 1990s.

This riverine minnow occurs in waters with slow to moderate flow in perennial sections of the Rio Grande and associated irrigation canals (Sublette <em>et al</em>. 1990). Most often it uses silt substrates (much less often sand) and typically occurs in pools, backwaters, or eddies formed by debris piles; larger individuals use a broad spectrum of habitats, including main and side channel runs, but this species rarely uses areas with high water velocities (USFWS 2007). The species most commonly occurs in depths of less than 20&#160;centimetres&#160;in the summer and 31- 40&#160;centimetres&#160;(median) in the winter; few use areas with depths greater than 50&#160;centimetres&#160;(USFWS 2007). Winter habitat tends to be near instream debris piles (USFWS 2007). This is a pelagic spawner that produces thousands of semibuoyant, non-adhesive eggs that passively drift downstream while developing (see USFWS 2007). Developing eggs and larvae drift passively with river currents for about 3-5 days (Platania and Altenbach 1998). Drift distances may extend more than 100 km with elevated river flows during the spring-time spawning period.","Throughout much of the historical range, the decline may be attributed in part to destruction and modification of habitat due to dewatering and diversion of water, water impoundment (several dams now intersect the historical range), and modification of the river (channelisation). Competition and predation by introduced non-native species, water quality degradation, and other factors may also have contributed to the decline (USFWS 2010). Some of these threats have been reduced since the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow was listed as endangered, but none have been eliminated (USFWS 2010). The population has become fragmented and isolated and is vulnerable to natural and human-caused factors that could further reduce population size (USFWS 2010). Analyses by Alò and Turner (2005) suggest that the genetically effective size in the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow currently is ""much smaller than expected based on adult census size; in fact, it is sufficiently small to warrant concern about extinction from genetic factors in the long term.""<br/><br/>Survival of the species continues to be threatened by habitat and flow modifications (dewatering, channelization, regulation, and diversion of river flow to provide water for irrigation; diminished water quality caused by municipal, industrial, and agricultural discharges), and lack of suitable aquatic refugia during periods of low or no flow (Bestgen and Platania 1991, USFWS 1994, 2003, 2007, 2010). Drought exacerbates the problem of dewatering of habitat for human uses. Recruitment of young fish into breeding populations may be limited because eggs and larvae are entrained through water diversion structures and are transported downstream into unsuitable nursery habitats (e.g., Elephant Butte Reservoir) (Platania and Altenbach 1998). Additionally, dams may block upstream return to natal sites or prevent recolonization of areas where the species has been extirpated (e.g., Luttrell <em>et al</em>. 1999). It is unlikely that predation is a major factor in the decline of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow, but it has probably played a minor role, with increasing importance as populations have come under greater stress from other factors (USFWS 2010). Competition and/or hybridization with non-native species in the future could potentially affect the remaining populations of Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (USFWS 2010). A small range makes the species vulnerable to catastrophic events (e.g., loss of surface water) that could wipe out the remaining population (USFWS 2003). <br/><br/>""Although various conservation efforts have been undertaken in the past and others are currently being carried out in the middle Rio Grande, and abundance in recent years is increasing, the threat of extinction of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow continues because of the high probability of continued drought, the fragmented and isolated nature of currently occupied habitat, and the absence of Silvery Minnows in other parts of the historic range. Additional work needs to be done to conserve this species and the ecosystems upon which it depends.""

Analysis of microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA detected little spatial genetic structure over the current geographic range, consistent with high gene flow despite fragmentation by dams (Alò and Turner 2005). An estimated 90-95 percent of the population is believed to be in the 96  km portion of the Rio Grande downstream of the San Acacia Dam (Ikenson  2002).<br/><br/>Analysis of temporal genetic data indicated that present-day effective population size of the largest extant population of this species (San Acacia reach) was 78 and the ratio of effective size to adult numbers was approximately 0.001 during the study period (1999 to 2001) (Alò and Turner  2005). Thus, the adult population size in this reach, which is estimated to include 90-95% of the total population, appeared to be roughly 78,000.<br/><br/>Abundance of this species exhibits substantial (order of magnitude) fluctuations from year to year (Alò and Turner  2005).<br/><br/>Catch rates (CPUE) declined from the early and mid-1990s through 2003 (USFWS 2007). In 2004 and 2005, abundance of the remaining population (in the middle Rio Grande) increased. In 2004 and 2005, the Rio Grande experienced an increased stream discharge, compared to the extended low-flow conditions seen in 2002 and 2003. Relative abundance of the species declined from approximately 50 percent of the total fish community in 1995 to about 5 percent in 2004 (USFWS 2007).<br/><br/>In December 2008, Silvery Minnows were introduced into the Rio Grande  River near Big Bend, Texas, as a nonessential, experimental population  (USFWS 2010). More than 2.6 million minnows had been released in the Big Bend region until 2017 and, although some successful reproduction have been observed, sustaining populations have not yet been achieved (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2017).",Unknown,"Historical range included the Rio Grande and Pecos River systems, Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico; in the Rio Grande, this species occurred from Española, New Mexico, downstream to the Gulf of Mexico; in the Pecos River it occurred from the Rio Grande to Santa Rosa, New Mexico; it also occurred in the lower Rio Chama and the lower Jemez River, tributaries of the Rio Grande in New Mexico (USFWS 2010). It has never been found in any Mexican tributaries to the Rio Grande, despite extensive collection efforts (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2003). Currently, the species is known to occur only in one reach of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, a 280 km stretch of river that runs from Cochiti Dam to the headwaters of Elephant Butte Reservoir: this includes a small portion of the lower Jemez River, a tributary to the Rio Grande north of Albuquerque (Sublette <em>et al</em>. 1990, Bestgen and Platania 1991, USFWS 1994, 1999, 2007, 2010, Bestgen and Propst 1996, Dudley <em>et al</em>. 2005).

It is known to occur off the coasts of Iraq, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, where it is considered to be common. Additional population information is not available. This species is of high commercial importance to the fisheries industry as a game- and bait-fish throughout its distribution. Fisheries pressure is increasing in several countries and it is a major aquaculture species in the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan. Although this species is not known to face any major threats at this time, there is little information on the population size or trend of this species and fisheries pressure is increasing. There are no known, species-specific conservation measures in place for this species currently. However, there are several marine protected areas throughout its distribution and it has been recorded from at least one within the Persian Gulf. Therefore,&#160;<em>Chanos chanos </em>is currently listed as Least Concern. However, more research is currently required to assess the status of various subpopulations from throughout its widespread range.","This is a marine species entering estuaries and rivers (Seegers <em>et al</em>. unpub.). It is a benthopelagic, amphidromous species that occurs in tropical waters between depths of 1 to 30 m (Shao and Lim 1991, Jeyaseelan 1998,&#160;Riede 2004). It is found in offshore marine waters and shallow coastal embayments, also frequently entering estuaries and occasionally penetrating freshwater streams (Allen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002).<br/><br/>Adults occur in small to large schools near the coasts or around islands where reefs are well developed. Eggs and larvae are pelagic up to two to three weeks. Older larvae migrate onshore and settle in coastal wetlands (mangroves, estuaries) during the juvenile stage, or occasionally enter freshwater lakes. Juveniles and subadults return to sea where they mature sexually. It spawns only in fully saline water. Larvae eat zooplankton, and juveniles and adults eat cyanobacteria, soft algae, small benthic invertebrates, and even pelagic fish eggs and larvae. It can thrive and grow in water as hot as 32°C (Frimodt 1995) (after Froese and Pauly 2003).&#160;The maximum standard length of this species is 180 cm male/unsexed (Lieske and Myers 1994), and the common standard length is 100 cm male/unsexed. The maximum published weight is 14.0 kg and the maximum reported age in 15 years (Bagarinao 1994).<br/><br/>This species spawns in clear, shallow waters above sandy bottoms or coral approximately 30 m from the shore. Females can spawn up to approximately five million eggs which hatch after 24 hours. Larvae then seek out clear, coastal and estuarine waters warmer than 23°C with salinities ranging from 10-32, and abundant phytoplankton. Spawning and fertilisation is nocturnal. The distribution of this species is limited by susceptibility to predation, but temperature is the prime limiting factor (Schuster 1960). Milkfish exhibit nocturnal broadcast spawning possibly more than once a year, and there is no parental involvement after the eggs are released. Spawning is seasonal and my be influenced by the lunar cycle. The spawning season is longer near the equator than at higher latitudes; may be influenced by water surface temperatures (Garcia 1990, Bagarinao 1994).<br/><br/>Larvae are collected from rivers and are grown in culture ponds into juveniles, which are marketed fresh, smoked, canned and frozen. Broodstocks can be raised and spawned in captivity to produce larvae in the hatchery (Bagarinao 1999).<br/><br/>This species is relatively common in large floodplain lakes in northwestern Madagascar.<br/><em><br/></em>","Overexploitation of larvae for aquaculture and over fishing are threats impacting this species. This species<em>&#160;</em>is also susceptible to numerous parasites and bacterial diseases (Regidor and Arthur 1986, Villaluz 1990, Leong 1992, Arthur and Lumanian-Mayo 1997).","No information is available for more than very local stocks.

The recent decline may be part of a longer-term fluctuation and the population should be monitored carefully to ascertain whether it shows signs of stabilising.,"The species breeds on coastal saltmarshes, sand and shingle beaches, dunes, cliff-tops with short grass and occasionally rocky shores, as well as inland along the shores of lakes, reservoirs and rivers or on agricultural grass and cereal fields, often some distance from water (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species is chiefly coastal, frequenting estuarine mudflats, saltmarshes and sandy and rocky shores (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground often on raised surfaces (e.g. earth banks) in the open or in short vegetation on cultivated or uncultivated land, cliff-tops, rocky outcrops or clearings in taller vegetation including woods and moorland (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996,&#160;Snow &amp;&#160;Perrins 1998).<br/><br/>Most populations of this species are fully migratory, inland breeders moving to the coast for the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds from April to July (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) in solitary pairs or small groups (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), during the winter foraging singly or in small groups of up to 10 individuals (Snow &amp; Perrins 1998) and with larger flocks often forming in major bays and estuaries and at roosting sites (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow &amp; Perrins 1998). When foraging on soft intertidal substrates bivalves and gastropods are the most important food items for this species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Polychaetes and crustaceans are more important in estuaries however, and molluscs (e.g. mussels, limpets and whelks) are most important on rocky shores (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). When inland, prey such as earthworms and insect larvae (e.g. caterpillars and cranefly larvae) are also taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The main threat to the species is the over-fishing of benthic shellfish and the resulting disappearance of intertidal mussel and cockle beds (Atkinson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Verhulst <em>et al.</em> 2004, Ens 2006, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Bait digging has also been identified as a threat through loss of prey species and disturbance to the benthic fauna (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is also threatened by habitat degradation on its wintering grounds due to land reclamation (for example in the Yellow Sea [Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014]), pollution, human disturbance (Kelin &amp; Qiang 2006) (e.g. from construction work or recreational activities [Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014]), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006), industrial development including development of ports and oil extraction, oil spills, wind farms (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014) and reduced river flows (Kelin &amp; Qiang 2006). Rapid and extensive land reclamation is reported from staging and wintering grounds for the <em>osculans</em> population in South Korea and China and large-scale planting of <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> on the coast of eastern China may cause loss of foraging and nesting habitats (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014). Intensive agriculture including frequent mowing of grasslands and high densities of grazing livestock threatens chicks, eggs and nests and high levels of fertilizers and pesticides can reduce soil invertebrate biomass (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). A reduction in eutrophication is likely to have contributed to declines in some areas, owing to a loss of food resources (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014, H. Meltofte <em>in litt</em>. 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Sea level rise leading to increased coastal erosion and flooding is contributing to habitat loss in some areas (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Climate change has advanced the average egg-laying date of the species and is likely to reduce recruitment of bivalves, however warmer winters are expected to benefit the species leading to lower winter mortality (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Droughts in some inland areas are likely to lead to a loss of suitable habitat (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sarychev &amp; Mischenko 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is hunted in France but the effects of hunting at the population level are not known (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). It may be subject to subsistence egg collection in China (Melville <em>et al</em>, 2014) and illegal hunting elsewhere (Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014). Eggs and chicks are known to be predated by Corvidae, gulls, American Mink&#160;<em>Neovison vison</em>, dogs and foxes&#160;<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>&#160;(Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014).&#160;The invasive Pacific Oyster <em>Crassostrea gigas</em> has become abundant in the Oosterschelde (Netherlands) and is increasing in the Dutch Wadden Sea (van de Pol et al. 2014). Eurasian Oystercatcher generally does not eat this species of oyster which is reported to be invading mussel beds and may compete with cockles and mussels thus reducing food availability. However Pacific Oyster beds could also provide an area for mussel beds to re-establish. The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville &amp;&#160;Shortridge 2006).<br/><br/>In the northern part of the <em>longipes</em> population breeding range, cessation of grazing in coastal areas leading to development of shrubby vegetation threatens breeding habitats (Sarychev and Mischenko 2014). Conversely, intensive grazing in some areas may pose a threat to this population. Pollution from sewage, heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides have been identified as potential threats for the&#160;<em>osculans&#160;</em>population (Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).","The global   population is estimated to number c. 925,000-1,030,000 individuals, based on expert opinion (Wetlands   International 2019), and comprising the three separate subspecies of <em>H. o. ostralegus</em>&#160;(820,000),&#160;<em>H. o.&#160;longpipes</em>&#160;(100,000-200,000) and <em>H. o. osculans</em>&#160;(5,000-10,000; Wetlands International 2019). This is roughly equivalent to 616,667-686,667 mature individuals, here placed in the band 500,000-999,999 mature individuals. Population estimates are lower than those of recent assessments due to the recent taxonomic split, whereby <em>Haematopus finschi</em>&#160;(South Island Oystercatcher), previously considered a subspecies of <em>Haematopus ostralegus</em>&#160;(del Hoyo <em>et. al.</em> 2014), was designated a separate species.",Decreasing,"The species has a wide range comprising three flyway populations. <em>H. o. ostralegus</em> breeds from <strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Scandinavia</strong> east to north-west&#160;<strong>Russia</strong>, south through <strong>U.K.</strong> to north-west <strong>France</strong>, with isolated populations in the Mediterranean, and winters on coasts south to West Africa. <em>H. o. longipes</em> breeds from west and central Russia south to the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas, and east to western Siberia, and winters on coasts from East Africa through Arabia to <strong>India</strong>; <em>H. o. osculans</em> breeds from coastal north-east Russia through Manchuria to the west and south coasts of the Korean Peninsula south to Fujian province, <strong>China</strong>, and winters in eastern China and along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula (more than 50% of the population is thought to winter at just one site, Yubu Island, <strong>South Korea </strong>and a further 25% are thought to winter at Lianyunggang, Jiangsu, China; Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>H. o. ostralegus</em>&#160;is not significantly exploited by human populations. Across most of its distribution, the species is legally protected and has not been hunted since the mid-1980s however, hunting remains a major source of mortality for <em>ostralegus</em>&#160;throughout France (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Between 1993-99, between 1,800-2,000 (mild winters) and 8,000-17,000 (severe winters where birds wintered in France to avoid more northerly locations) were shot per year (Trolliet 2000, Triplet 2000).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The species is listed on Annex II (B) of the EU Birds Directive.

There is also evidence that the creation of large marine protected areas (MPAs) to protect this species from the threat of anthropogenic shellfish over-fishing may not be an effective management or conservation technique on a global scale, especially if over-fishing continues to occur in adjacent areas (Verhulst&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Limit human activities in some areas to prevent disturbance (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Limit hunting in France when cold weather pushes large numbers of birds into France (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Increase awareness of the species.

Larvae are found in inland wetlands and marshes, including old abandoned gem mining pits surrounded by tropical forest. This species is not thought to be tolerant to habitat disturbance as it requires canopy cover (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).","Threats to this species across its range include small-scale firewood collection, human-induced fires (in the northern portion of its range only), encroaching human settlements, small-scale hydropower stations, encroaching large- and small-scale agriculture (including tea and cinnamon plantations), and the resulting pollution from the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020). Within Morningside Reserve specifically, this species is threatened by the loss of forest canopy for expansion of cardamom and tea plantations at the expense of cloud forest habitat, clearing of undergrowth, small-scale collection of firewood, and encroaching human settlements. Changing agricultural practices within cardamom plantations could also negatively affect this species, particularly if the change involves the use of agro-chemicals. Small-scale potato cultivation and the resulting pollution from pesticide use also presents a threat to this species (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020). Lowland species (e.g. <em>P. rus</em> and <em>hallidayi</em> encroaching into highland habitats within the Morningside reserve may also constitute a threat to this species as it is displacing and out competing other species (M. Meegaskumbura pers. comm. February 2020). Additionally, invasive plant species (e.g. <em>Acacia</em> sp.) are actively being planted in the region, which is resulting in forest clearing as plantations expand (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).&#160;Illegal gem mining taking place in the area is a threat to this species, although once these sites have been abandoned the remaining pits are used as breeding sites (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change also poses a threat to this species across its range, as this is the only perhumid region in all of South Asia where the dry season is short, with an average rainfall of at least 100 mm per month, which explains the biodiversity-rich mixed-dipterocarp forests. While there does not appear to be a negative rainfall trend in this region, warming is predicted to result in reduced surface moisture. While the southwest monsoon rainy period (May-July) is gradually becoming longer, the first intermonsoon (March-April) is yielding less rain, delaying the onset of the rains that follow the December-February dry season. These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests).","This species is uncommon (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020). However, it was found in large numbers at the type locality in 1996, perhaps benefiting from human modification of the habitat through the creation of mining pits, which this species uses for breeding (Fernando and Siriwardhane 1996).&#160;A decreasing population trend is inferred from the ongoing decline in the quality and extent of this species' habitat.",Decreasing,"This species was previously known only from two sites in southern Sri Lanka: Morningside in eastern Sinharaja, and Mahawalatenna in Balangoda.

At night males have been recorded calling from branches and leaves 0.3-1.5 m above the ground (Manamendra-Arachchi and Pethiyagoda 2005). This species breeds by direct development. The female excavates a deep hole in the forest floor where the eggs are then deposited. This species is not tolerant of habitat disturbance as it requires forest cover (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).","This species is threatened by habitat loss due to expanding human settlements, small-scale wood extraction, human-induced fires, and encroaching small-scale agriculture including tea plantations. Additionally, various species of invasive plants are encroaching on the natural forest habitat causing habitat loss and degradation (M.&#160;Meegaskumbura, N.&#160;Wijayathilaka, M.&#160;Wickramasinghe&#160;pers. comm. February 2020). Agro-chemical pollution due to biocide use and chemical fertilizers from areas surrounding the forest is also a threat.<br/><br/>Climate change is also a threat to the species. Annual rainfall is declining steeply across this region, especially on the perhumid western slopes. This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016). This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008). These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests). The preponderance of amphibian species in the highlands are <em>Pseudophilautus</em><em> </em>shrub frogs which, being direct developers, are independent of bodies of standing water. Instead, they depend on the ambient moisture of the forest for both homeostasis and reproduction. Highland aridification and warming therefore, are serious—if as yet unassessed—potential threats to these species.","This species was previously thought to be rare, but due to increased survey effort it is now known to be common in suitable habitat (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).

Future intensification of resource competition could lead to more rapid declines for exposed populations. Increasing oil exploration around the Falkland Islands is a growing concern for the species (Lynch 2013) and pollution from oil spills represents a threat on local scales. <br/><br/>Harmful algal blooms were attributed as the cause of the paralytic shellfish poisoning incident that resulted in a major Gentoo Penguin mortality event in 2002, from which the population took several years to recover (Pistorius <em>et al.</em> 2010).

However, the species needs conservation action to prevent future decline.","<p>  </p><p>Alpine Ibex typically inhabit open, rocky habitats above the upper tree-line ecotone in Alpine massifs. Steep slopes with rugged topography and meadows and pastures are preferred. Below the tree line, at subalpine levels, ibex are only found in open, sunny woodland interspersed with rocky outcrop. Ibex mainly feed on alpine grasses and herbs, but woody plants and cryptogams in low quantities have been also reported &#160;(Couturier 1962, Grignolio <em>et al. </em>2003, Hofmann and Nievergelt 1972, Nievergelt and Zingg 1986, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999, Villaret <em>et al. </em>1997).</p><p>  </p><p>Ibex activity peaks during daylight hours and is reduced during the night (Signer <em>et al. </em>2011). The Alpine Ibex shows seasonal migration between summer and winter home ranges. They spend the harsh winter months at lower elevations on south-exposed steep slopes, while they select higher altitudes in summer, following the green-up wave and seeking for lower temperatures (Aublet <em>et al.</em> 2009, Brivio <em>et al.</em> 2019). Winter and summer home ranges may be several kilometres distant, but individuals show a high fidelity to seasonal home ranges (Parrini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). </p><p>  </p><p>Males and females live in separate groups outside the rutting season (Villaret et al. 1997, Bon et al. 2001, Grignolio et al. 2003). Group size largely depends on the season, on the habitat and on the population density (Toïgo <em>et al. </em>1996), even if it can be affected by other environmental drivers (Grignolio <em>et al. </em>2019). &#160;Gestation lasts about 167 days (Stüwe and Grodinsky 1987). Females give birth from early June to mid-July, usually to one kid even if some cases of twinship have been reported (Couturier 1962, Apollonio <em>et al.</em> 2013). Males and females are sexually mature when 18 months old. However, males can access reproduction only at older ages because of social constraints, and the age of females at primiparity may be delayed in high density populations (Toïgo <em>et al. </em>2002). The rut takes place from early December to mid-January, with a peak between 15<sup>th</sup> of December and 10<sup>th</sup> of January (Couturier 1962; Willisch and Neuhaus 2009, 2010; Apollonio <em>et al. </em>2013). Dominant (i.e. older) males adopt the ‘tending’ tactic, courting oestrus females to gain exclusive access to mating, while younger, subordinate, males adopt &#160;the alternative ‘coursing’ tactic, trying to achieve temporary access to females who eventually are separated from the tending, dominant male (Willisch and Neuhaus 2009, Apollonio <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>  </p><p>Maximum longevity is up to 15-17 years for males and 20-22 years for females, even if rare exceptions have been reported for older individuals.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>              <a name=""_msocom_1""></a>","<p>  </p><p>Although at present the species is not considered threatened because of its increasing numbers during the last decades, there is concern regarding its genetic diversity and ability to cope with the rapid global changes that are currently occurring. </p><p>  </p><p>A major threat for Alpine Ibex comes from its extremely low genetic diversity and high inbreeding levels, which are consequences of the severe repeated bottlenecks experienced by all extant populations combined with the small size and isolation of these populations linked to low recolonization rates (no genetic exchange between populations) (Biebach &amp; Keller 2009, 2010, 2012). This may lead to inbreeding depression (Brambilla <em>et al. </em>2015), increased disease susceptibility (Brambilla <em>et al.</em> 2018) and reduced population growth rates (Bozzuto <em>et al. </em>2019). At a time when the environment changes rapidly because of global changes and when new diseases emerge, this low genetic diversity may be a serious threat for Alpine Ibex.</p><p>  </p><p>Modification in human activities may also represent a potential threat. The increase of recreational activities, i.e. hiking, climbing, paragliding, the use of drones or helicopters, represent a disturbance that can affect Alpine Ibex home range selection and activity budget (Brambilla and Brivio 2018). The intensive use of pastures by domestic herds (cattle, sheep and goats) may promote competition for food resources and transmission of diseases. Hybridization with domestic goats is also a threat for the conservation of the species. </p><p>  </p><p>The Alps are severely exposed to climate warming with many negative consequences on Alpine Ibex through direct effects (adaptive behaviour to avoid heat to the detriment of feeding) or indirect effects (mismatch between vegetation peak and birth dates, decreasing food quantity and quality in summer) (Aublet <em>et al.</em> 2009, Brivio <em>et al. </em>2019, Mason <em>et al. </em>2017, Pettorelli <em>et al. </em>2007, Toïgo <em>et al.</em> 2017). In consequence of the ongoing climate change, ibex is predicted to forage in limited areas closer and closer to mountaintops (Brivio <em>et al. </em>2019) and thus to find more and more restricted suitable habitat.&#160; The ongoing natural expansion of a predator (i.e. the wolf) in the Alps does not seem to give rise to concern (Grignolio <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019, Palmegiani <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).</p><p>  </p><p>Some diseases may endanger populations, e.g. sarcoptic mange, infectious respiratory syndromes (caused by viruses and bacteria), arthritis-encephalitis virus infections (CAEV).</p><p>  </p><p>The Alpine Ibex is legally hunted in some countries (e.g. Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Argentina), while hunting is prohibited in other countries such as France and Italy (Shackleton 1997). Legal hunting is not considered a threat if it is properly planned and regulated, but poaching is a potential threat (Dupré <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p><p>  </p><p>Because of all the reasons mentioned above, the species may be at risk in a not too far future. Conservation measures have to be undertaken such as the reinforcement of genetic diversity and connectivity between populations.&#160;<br/></p>","After centuries of decline caused primarily by intensive hunting, Alpine Ibex was close to extinction at the beginning of the 19th century, with only one hundred individuals surviving in the region around the Gran Paradiso massif along the Italian-French border (Grodinsky and Stüwe 1987). Thanks to active protection and to intensive reintroduction programs conducted in the 20th century, the species recovered and is now present again along the entire Alpine arc (AIESG Alpine Ibex European Specialist Group)<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><a name=""_msoanchor_1"" class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1""></a>. <br/>An overall estimate of about 53,000 individuals from 180 colonies was assessed in the years 2008-2017 (AIESG Alpine Ibex European Specialist Group). The numbers of Alpine Ibex in the different countries of the native range are around: 9,450 in France, 16,400 in Italy, 18,000 in Switzerland, 7,400 in Austria, 500 in Germany, and 300 in Slovenia. The overall number of individuals appears to have very slightly increased over the last 10 years compared to the estimates of previous reports.&#160;<br/>However, the distribution is quite fragmented and not all the suitable habitat is occupied, mainly because the species has a very low colonizing potential. Recently, some restocking and translocations were conducted to increase genetic variation of the reintroduced populations and to favour gene flow among them. Indeed, because of its particular history, the species experienced several severe genetic bottlenecks, and all the extant populations have a low genetic diversity and high inbreeding levels (Biebach and Keller 2009, 2012; Grossen<em> et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Stable,"<p>The Alpine Ibex is endemic to Europe, where its native range is the Alps (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005). The species was driven very close to extinction in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century due to overhunting and poaching. Thanks to active protection and reintroduction programs, nowadays the species is present again across the entire Alpine arc. All current populations originate from re-introductions or introductions, except for the population in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy). Alpine Ibex populations are present in: France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria and Slovenia. Additional ibex populations can be found in Bulgaria and Argentina, regions where it was introduced around 1980s, far away from the species’ native range. Although the range of Alpine ibex has increased over the last century, as a result of translocations and few natural recolonizations, its distribution is still fragmented because of the very long recolonization time of the species. <br/><br/>Alpine ibex mainly occurs between 1,600 and 3,200 m asl although several populations may be found as low as 700-800 m asl (Nievergelt and Zingg 1986).</p>","Management regulations are different between countries. Alpine Ibex is completely protected in some countries (France, Italy), while hunted for sport and food in others (Austria, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Switzerland). Legal hunting is well-managed and is not considered to be a threat to the species. No data are available to estimate poaching pressure.",Terrestrial,"<p>  </p><p>The Alpine Ibex is included in the Bern Convention (Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, Appendix III – Protected Fauna Species, 1979) and in the European Directive 43/92/CEE “Habitat”, Annex V (Updated with Directive 97/62/CE, 27 Oct 1997). The species is protected under national legislation in France and Italy and occurs in several protected areas in most countries. It has been the subject of intensive conservation management in the form of reintroductions and introductions ( Stüwe and Nievergelt 1991, Shackleton 1997). Reintroductions began at the beginning of 20<sup>th</sup> century in the Swiss Alps and in the Alpi Marittime region (Italy) but most reintroductions have been conducted from the 1970s (Dupré <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p><p>  </p><p>Most recent recommendations for the conservation of the Alpine Ibex strongly emphasize the need (1) to reinforce the genetic diversity of existing populations by translocating individuals from other populations, and (2) to enhance the connectivity between populations by reintroducing individuals in areas potentially connecting two populations. A particular focus has to be exerted on the genetic characteristics of translocated individuals to maximize genetic diversity in the reinforced population. A good knowledge of the space use patterns within and between subpopulations is a prerequisite for translocations aimed at increasing the connectivity between them.<br/> <br/> Reintroductions to suitable areas where the Alpine Ibex is still absent should also be planned to ensure a safe future to this species. For such reintroductions, as recommended earlier by <br/> Shackleton (1997) and Dupré <em>et al.</em> (2001), it would be appropriate (1) using reliable environmental suitability models for the selection of areas where Alpine Ibex colonies could be reintroduced. These models should particularly take into account the availability of areas where overheating during summer may be avoided; (2) conducting a translocation strategy that aims to make the separate colonies part of a metapopulation; (3) giving priority to protected areas, or at least to &#160;areas capable of guaranteeing an efficient surveillance against poaching and disturbance (this does not mean that controlled hunting areas should be excluded<em> a priori</em>); (4) selecting founder individuals for new colonies according to specific criteria (sex, age, genetic diversity); (5) limiting or even possibly eliminating domestic sheep and goat grazing in reintroduction areas to decrease the risk of disease transmission, resource competition, and hybridization; and (6) screening the suitability of reintroduction sites in relation to the absence of endemic diseases. <br/> <br/> Other conservation recommendations include ensuring that any harvest should be sustainable (through monitoring, legislation, and international cooperation), eliminating poaching (through legislation, law enforcement, education and communication), reducing the impacts of human disturbance (e.g. by providing refugees in areas with intense tourism pressure), monitoring all populations and investigating the effects of global changes.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Europe

The species is believed to have undergone a decline  exceeding 50% in the western part of its range over the past 30 years  (approximately four generations). The world-wide population of Sea Otters decreased to  approximately 2,000 animals by the end of the commercial fur trade in  1911 (Kenyon 1969). The population recovered from 11 remnant populations  located in Russia (Bering Island, Kamchatka Peninsula, and Kuril  Islands) and in the United States (in Alaska [Aleutian Islands, Alaska  Peninsula, Kodiak archipelago, and Prince William Sound] and California)  (Kenyon 1969, Lensink, 1960). The remnant populations were small and  widely dispersed, resulting in low genetic diversity compared to  pre-exploitation levels and as measured by both nuclear and  mitochondrial genetic markers (Larson <em>et al.</em> 2002a,b, and 2012).  However, both theoretical models and empirical data suggest populations  have retained approximately 70% of pre-exploitation diversity (Ralls <em>et al.</em> 1983, Larson <em>et al.</em> 2012). Population estimates and counts made between 2000–2018 give a generalised worldwide estimate of 128,902 Sea Otters. However, many populations have not been surveyed regularly or recently; there is a pressing need for these surveys to be able to update the global population size estimate and to monitor future population trends more accurately<br/><br/>Since  the mid-1900s, there has been population recovery for the species  (Kenyon 1969). However, in the United States, two subspecies of Sea Otters are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (1973),  a significant population segment in the SW Alaska genetic stock (<em>E. l.  kenyoni</em>) in Alaska (USFWS 2013a, USFWS 2013b) and<em> E. l. nereis</em> in  California (USFWS 2003). In Russia, significant Sea Otter (<em>E. l. lutris</em>)  population declines are thought to have occurred for the Kamchatka  Peninsula and northern Kuril Islands in the past decade (Kornev 2007,  Kornev 2010, Bodkin 2015). In Alaska, precipitous population declines  occurred in the Aleutian Islands beginning in the late 1980s–2005. By  2000, counts of Sea Otters had decreased by 90% with a declining trend  through 2005 and an estimated loss to the population of 62,000–90,000 Sea Otters (Doroff <em>et al.</em> 2003, Estes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Burn and Burn <em>et al.</em> 2003, Burn and Doroff 2005). The probable cause of the decline was increased predation by killer whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Estes <em>et al.</em>  1998). Population counts also remain low for the Alaska Peninsula (Burn  and Doroff 2005, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Stock Assessment  Reports). In the listed population, the Kodiak archipelago and lower  Cook Inlet appeared stable or increasing during the same period that  population declines were documented in the Aleutian chain west of the  Alaska Peninsula. In total, five of the six remnant population centres  have experienced significant population reductions in the SW Sea Otter  population stock.<br/><br/>The other threatened subspecies, the southern Sea Otter in California is recovering to near its threshold for delisting under  the Endangered Species Act (1973), however, the present range  distribution is only a fraction of the historic distribution (Tinker <em>et al.</em>  2019). Population range expansion has been greatly impacted by  shark-bite mortality in the northern end of the subspecies range  (Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2018). In addition, the habitat north of the  central California sea otter range, northern California and Oregon in  the Pacific Northwest has had major reductions in canopy-forming kelp in  the past decade due to the loss of sea stars from sea star wasting  disease resulting in an abundance of sea urchins that graze intensively  on kelp (Roger-Bennett and Catton 2019). The giant kelp canopy likely  afforded Sea Otters protection from shark predation, and it has been  hypothesized that the loss of this habitat has been a factor in intensifying the predation. Central and southern California thus remains  the only location for this subspecies to date, and it is one of the  extant 11 historical remnant populations.<br/><br/>In the western parts of  the range the northern Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula have  declined from approximately 22,000 Sea Otters to approximately 10,600  since the early 2000s (Kornev 2007, Kornev 2010, Bodkin 2015). This is a  long-established region for Sea Otters, and there are no documented  reasons for this decline. The Commander Islands population is believed to be stable  and had one of the longest time-series for population surveys for the  species, however this region has not been surveyed since the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Unquantified environmental stressors to all the subspecies  populations will include future ocean conditions becoming warmer,  acidifying, and deoxygenating (IPCC 2019). Warmer oceans favour range  expansion and prevalence of dinoflagellate phytoplankton species, many  of which are toxin producing (IPCC 2019) and will impact Sea Otter prey  in ways that are not yet understood. In California, effects of harmful  algal and cyanobaterial blooms may be acute or chronic on sea otters and  have resulted in individual health declines and deaths (Kreuder <em>et al.</em> 2003, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2010, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2017). Recent studies have shown saxitoxins increase in toxicity through biochemical changes associated with lower pH (Roggatz <em>et al.</em>  2019), this has the potential to decrease available prey in future  scenarios for Sea Otters. In addition, calcium carbonate shell forming  bivalves are thought to decrease with increasing ocean acidification  (Waldbusser <em>et al.</em> 2015). The effect of changing and decreasing  bivalve abundance on sea otter populations is unknown, but it will  likely be negative.<br/><br/>Within the last two decades, large-scale population declines in Sea Otters have been recorded in the North and Western Pacific (regions that contain the majority of the global population of Sea Otter). Based on these declines, the global population is suspected to have undergone a more than 50% reduction over the past 21 years (three generations based on Gagne <em>et al</em>. 2018). Population surveys are urgently needed across large parts of the Sea Otter's distribution. The prevalence of diseases (<em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>in California and <em>Streptococcus </em>Syndrome in parts of Alaska) are indicated to have slowed down the growth rate of Sea Otter populations (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2019). Moreover, oil spills, entanglement in fishing gear and increased predation by killer whales (in the Aleutian Islands) and white sharks (in California) (Tinker <em>et al</em>. 2016) are posing continuous threat to the species. Increase in the extent of these threats have limited sea otter populations to refugia, leading to decreased use of suitable habitats, increased competition and slower population growth rates. In view of these ongoing threats, the species is listed as Endangered under the criteria A2abe.<br/><p></p><p></p>","Throughout their range, Sea Otters use a variety of near shore marine environments and 84% of foraging occurs in water ≤30 m in depth (Bodkin <em>et al.</em> 2004) and most of their foraging occurs within a kilometre of the shore. Their classic association is with mixed rocky intertidal substrates supporting kelp beds, but also frequent soft-sediment dominated areas where kelp is absent (Riedman and Estes 1990, DeMaster<em> et al.</em> 1996, Burn and Doroff 2005). Kelp canopy is thought to be an important habitat component, used for foraging and resting (Riedman and Estes 1990). They are found most often in areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds and swells, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, barrier reefs and refuges such as inlets, bays and estuaries. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, Sea Otters can also live in areas where the sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Individuals generally occupy a relatively small home range a few to tens of kilometres long and have high site fidelity, remaining there year-round, however, some individuals, primarily males, do make long distance (more than hundreds of kilometers) movements and migrations (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 2000; Tinker <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2019). Sea Otters forage in rocky and soft-sediment communities on or near the ocean floor. The maximum confirmed depth of dive was 97 m (Newby 1975); however, recent studies using time-depth recorders implanted in Sea Otters indicate average maximum forage depths of 54 m for female and 82 m for male Sea Otters (Bodkin <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/> <br/> Sea Otters are weakly territorial (Kenyon 1969) with fighting and aggression rare (Loughlin 1980). Only adult male Sea Otters establish territories. Males patrol territorial boundaries and attempt to exclude other adult males from the area. Females move freely between and among male territories. Groups of male and female Sea Otters generally rest separately. Sea Otter annual home ranges can occupy up to 0.8 km² (80 ha) and extend along 16 km of coastline (Kenyon 1969, Loughlin 1980). Typically, female sea otter home ranges are about 1.5–2 times larger than resident adult males during the breeding season; however, females have smaller annual or lifetime home ranges than males (Riedman and Estes 1990). Jameson (1989) found that territorial adult males occupied a mean home range of 40.3 ha during the summer-fall period (when home range size was considered equal to territory size); and mean coastline length was 1.1 km. Winter-spring mean home range size of territorial adult males that remained in female areas was 78.0 ha, with a mean coastline length of 2.16 km.<br/> <br/> Sea Otter diet consists almost exclusively of marine invertebrates, including sea urchins, a variety of bivalves such as clams and mussels, abalone, other molluscs, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and snails, to kelp and cancer crabs, to giant Pacific octopuses (Estes 1980). Sea urchins, abalones and rock crabs are the principal prey of Sea Otters in newly reoccupied habitats of central California (Vandevere, 1969), whereas, clams and crab make up the majority of the diet in soft-sediment habitats (Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992, Doroff and DeGange 1994). Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are present in a range of sizes, Sea Otters tend to select larger prey over smaller ones of similar type (Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992). In California, it has been noted that Sea Otters ignore Pismo clams smaller than 3 inches (7 cm) across. One exception is in the Aleutian archipelago were Sea Otters were observed to regularly eat fish, which could comprise up to 50% of their diet in some seasons. The fish species eaten were usually bottom dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as the Red Irish Lord and Globefish (Estes 1980). They also consume crab, clam, mussels, turban snails, sea cucumbers, squid, octopus, chitons, tubeworms, large barnacles, scallops, and sea stars (Wild and Ames 1974, Riedman and Estes 1990). Burrowing bivalve molluscs such as clams are excavated by digging in sand or mud bottoms and are the most common prey in soft-sediment communities (Calkins 1978, Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992, Doroff and DeGange 1994).<br/> <br/> Male Sea Otters reach sexual maturity around age five or six, but probably do not become territorial or reproductively successful for two or three subsequent years (Riedman and Estes 1990). Most female Sea Otters are sexually mature at age four or five, though some are mature as early as 2.5 years (Kenyon 1969, Jameson and Johnson 1993, Monson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Monson and DeGange 1995, von Biela 2007). Thus, it is thought that Sea Otter generation length is approximately seven years (Gagne <em>et al.</em> 2018). Sea Otters apparently are polygynous, although the exact nature of the mating system may vary. Females normally give birth to a single pup that weighs 1.4 to 2.3 kg at birth (Riedman and Estes 1990). Gestation has been documented to be approximately six months with an obligatory two to three-month delayed implantation phase and a four-month implanted phase when fetal growth occurs (Riedman and Estes 1990). Twinning has been documented in Sea Otters (Williams <em>et al</em>. 1980); however, litters larger than one are rare, and when they occur, neither pup is likely to survive (Jameson and Bodkin 1986). Pups are precocial and remain dependent upon their mothers for about six months (Jameson and Johnson 1993). Longevity in Sea Otters is estimated to be 15 to 20 years for females and 10 to 15 years for males (Riedman and Estes 1990).","<p>Oil spills are the greatest anthropogenic threat to Sea Otters (Geraci and Williams 1990). Sea Otters become hypothermic when oiled because oiled Sea Otter fur loses its insulation property and Sea Otters have no blubber layer. Oil can be ingested while grooming, leading to gastrointestinal disorders, other ailments and death. Thevolatile components of oil inhaled by sea otters can cause lung damage. Estimates of sea otter mortality following the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound ranged from 2,650 (Garrott <em>et al.</em> 1993) to 3,905 (DeGange <em>et al</em>. 1994). <br/> <br/> Significant numbers of Sea Otters drowned in gill and trammel nets in California from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (Estes 1990). Population declines in California’s sea otters may be incidental to summer commercial fisheries. Estes <em>et al</em>. (2003) found that Sea Otter mortality was elevated in the summer months and that commercial fin fish landings in the coastal live trap fishery increased. <br/> <br/>An ongoing and long-term study of sea otter health, body condition, and  causes of death for the southern Sea Otter indicate that shark bite  mortality is the most common primary cause of death followed by  acanthocephalan peritonitis, probable domoic acid intoxication,  cardomyopathy, end-of-lactation-syndrome, and primary bacterial  infection (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2017, Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2019). In  Alaska, Streptococcal endocarditis, encephalitis and/or septicemia,  referred to as Strep. syndrome has been identified in northern Sea Otters, as well as trauma from boat strikes. Goldstein <em>et al.</em> (2009) found northern Sea Otters from the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak and Kachemak Bay area infected with phocine distemper.<br/><br/>Killer  Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>), Great White Sharks (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>),  Bald Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em>), Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), wolves  (<em>Canis lupus</em>), and Brown Bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) have been documented as  predators of Sea Otters (Riedman and Estes 1990). Predation by Killer  Whales is one factor believed to have caused Sea Otter population  declines across the Western Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (Doroff <em>et al.</em> 2003, Estes <em>et al.</em> 1998, Hatfield <em>et al.</em>  1998). Significant declines in preferred prey species populations—Northern Fur Seals (<em>Callorhinus ursinus</em>), Harbour Seals (<em>Phoca  vitulina</em>), and Steller Sea Lions (<em>Eumetopias jubatus</em>) are believed to  have caused Killer Whales to prey switch and consume Sea Otters, a less  preferred prey because of their lack of blubber layer (Estes <em>et al.</em> 1998).<br/><br/>Unquantified  environmental stressors to all the subspecies populations may  include future ocean conditions becoming warmer, acidifying, and  deoxygenating (IPCC 2019). Warmer oceans favour the range expansion and  prevalence of dinoflagellate phytoplankton, many of which are toxin  producing and will impact Sea Otter prey in ways that are not yet  understood. In California, effects of harmful algal and cyanobacterial  blooms may be acute or chronic on Sea Otters (Kreuder <em>et al.</em> 2003, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2010, Miller <em>et al.</em>  2017). Ongoing studies are looking at the living population and data  from necropsies to elucidate the complex relationship between  cardiomyopathy and domoic acid exposure (Moriarty <em>et al.</em> 2019).  Work in Alaska suggests that Sea Otters can detect and avoid consuming  clams with low levels of saxitoxin or paralytic shellfish poisoning  (PSP) that is accumulated in Butter Clams (<em>Saxidomus gigantea; </em>Kvitek <em>et al.</em>  1991, Kvitek and Bretz 2004). Recent studies have shown saxitoxins  increase in toxicity through biochemical changes associated with lower  pH (Roggatz <em>et al.</em> 2019), this has the potential to decrease  available prey in future scenarios for Sea Otters. Bivalves are an  important prey species for Sea Otters living in soft-sediment habitat  regions, like the Kodiak archipelago, where Butter Clams constitute  &gt;50% of the Sea Otter diet. In addition, calcium carbonate shell  forming bivalves are thought to decrease with increasing ocean  acidification (Waldbusser <em>et al.</em> 2015). The effect that changing  and decreasing bivalve abundance will have on Sea Otter populations is  unprecedented, is likely to be negative.<br/><br/>Studies in Alaska, and  Washington have shown that Sea Otter predation on sea urchins may  indirectly enhance the growth of kelp and kelp-associated marine  communities. Shellfish are important to commercial, recreational, and  tribal fisheries throughout the species range, and predation by sea  otters can be significant and result in localized depletion of  commercial and subsistence shell fisheries. Emerging studies are looking  at the benefits of kelp-dominated ecosystems such as increasing fin  fish populations and ecosystem stability in the face of climate change  (Markel and Shurin 2015).<br/><br/>Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by<em>  Toxoplasma gondii</em>, is a major cause of mortality and contributor to the  slow rate of population recovery for southern Sea Otters in California  (Conrad <em>et al.</em> 2005). Thomas and Cole (1996) reported that  mortality from infectious diseases, such as peritonitis, protozoal  encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, etc. were occurring at a high rate,  wherein, some diseases appeared to be on the rise while others were  newly reported. Several of the diseases were predominately affecting  prime age, breeding adults.</p>","<p>In the early 1700s, the worldwide population was estimated to be between 150,000 (Kenyon 1969) and 300,000 individuals (Johnson 1982), occurring along the North Pacific from northern Japan to the central Baja Peninsula in Mexico. Its abundance was greatly reduced by human exploitation. Although it appears that First Nations harvests periodically led to local reductions of Sea Otters (Simenstad <em>et al.</em> 1978, Jones <em>et al.</em> 2011), the species remained abundant throughout its range until the mid-1700s. Following the arrival in Alaska of Russian explorers in 1741, extensive commercial harvest of Sea Otters over the next 150 years resulted in the near extirpation of the species. When sea otters were afforded protection by the International Fur Seal Treaty in 1911, probably fewer than 2,000 animals remained in 13 remnant colonies (Kenyon 1969): two in the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka; one in the Commander Islands; a total of 10 in the following areas: Aleutian Islands (2) and along the Alaska Peninsula (3); Kodiak Archipelago (1), Prince William Sound (1), the Queen Charlotte Islands (1), central California (1), and San Benito Islands (1). However, the Queen Charlotte, Canada and San Benito Island, Mexico remnant Sea Otter populations became extinct and likely did not contribute to the recolonization of the species following near extirpation (Kenyon 1969).<br/> <br/>Sea Otters currently have established populations in parts of the Kuril  Islands, the Russian east coast, throughout coastal Alaska, British  Columbia, Washington, and California, and there have been reports of  single-animal observations in Mexico and Japan (a recent maximum of 20 in  the latter). Population estimates and counts made between 2000–2018 give  a generalised worldwide estimate of 128,902 Sea Otters. However, many populations have not been surveyed regularly or recently. The biggest  change during this time being the decrease in the northern Kuril Islands  and the Kamchatka Peninsula which have declined from approximately  22,000 Sea Otters to approximately 12,100 since the early 2000s (Kornev  2007, Kornev 2010), representing a decline of approximately 55% for this subpopulation within the last 21 years (three generations). This is a long-established region for Sea Otters (holding approximately 9–10% of the global population) and  there are no documented reasons for this decline. The population in the Commander Islands is believed to be stable and had one of the longest time-series for  population surveys for the species—however, this region has not been  surveyed since the late 1990s. It is thought that budget restrictions  have prevented any current population assessments for the species in  this region.<br/><br/>In Alaska, precipitous population declines occurred  in the Aleutian Islands beginning in the late 1980s–2005. In the 1980s, around 90,000 Sea Otters were thought to occur in the Aleutian Islands. By 2000,this population had decreased by 90% (to around 9,000), with a declining trend continuing through  to 2005 and an estimated loss to the population of 62,000–90,000 Sea Otters (Burn <em>et al.</em> 2003, Doroff <em>et al.</em> 2003, Estes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Burn and Doroff 2005). The probable cause of the decline was increased predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Estes <em>et al.</em>  1998). To date, there is no indication of further declines in counts  and no real indication that the population is showing signs of  significant recovery. Population counts also remain low for the Alaska  Peninsula (Burn and Doroff 2005, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Stock  Assessment Reports). In this listed population, the Kodiak archipelago  and lower Cook Inlet appeared stable or increasing during the same  period that population declines were documented in the Aleutian chain. A generalised estimate of Sea Otter numbers in Alaska is 98,780 (representing around 77% of the global population); in addition to ~9,000 in the Aleutian Islands, there are ~16,340 on the Alaskan Peninsula, ~46,700 in the Gulf of Alaska, and 25,700 in Southeast Alaska, however, many of these areas have not been surveyed thoroughly for over a decade (S. Larson pers. comm. 2021).<br/><br/>Between  1969 and 1972, 89 Sea Otters were translocated from Alaska (66% from  Prince William Sound and 33% from Amchitka Island in the Aleutians) to  the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where they  established a healthy population. Sea Otter range expansion has  continued and in 2008 it was documented that they have left Vancouver  Island and moved into northern Queen Charlotte Strait and the adjacent  British Columbia mainland coast and in some portions of the central  British Columbia mainland coast. The most recent population estimate is  6,754 (Nichol <em>et al.</em> 2015), representing around 7–8% of the global population. <br/><br/>During 1969 and 1970, 59 Sea Otters were translocated from the remnant population of Amchitka Island  to Washington State. The most recent surveys in 2019 indicate the  population is approximately 2,785 (around 2% of the global population) with an estimated average annual growth  rate of 9.8% and continued range expansion is expected (Jefferies <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/>California's Sea Otters are the descendants of a single colony of about 50 southern Sea Otters discovered near Big Sur in 1938. The southern Sea Otter  population in California is recovering to near its threshold for delisting under  the Endangered Species Act (1973), however, the present distribution is  only a fraction of the historic distribution (Tinker <em>et al.</em>  2019). The latest survey results report a three-year average of 2,962 Sea Otters (around 2% of the global population), including the mainland and the San Nicolas Island population,  which represents a &lt;1% growth rate per year (Hatfield <em>et al.</em>  2019). Population range expansion has been greatly impacted by  shark-bite mortality in the northern end of the subspecies’ range  (Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2019). The Pacific Northwest has had major  reductions in canopy-forming kelp in the past decade due to the loss of  sea stars through a wasting disease and now an abundance of urchins that  graze intensively on kelp (Roger-Bennett and Catton 2019). The giant  kelp likely afforded Sea Otters protection from shark predation, and the  loss of this habitat has been a factor intensifying the predation. On  the southern end of the range, at San Nicolas Island, the reintroduced  population originally established in the mid-1980s from the Central  California population is now well established, numbering over 100  animals, and has an estimated annual growth rate of 10.5% for the past five  years (Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2019). Schramm <em>et al.</em> 2014, based  on reports of sea otters in Baja California, Mexico, suggested that a  higher frequency of Sea Otters than in the past.<br/><br/>In Japan, small  numbers of Sea Otters (<em>E. l. lutris</em>) have been observed regularly on the  eastern side of Hokkaido Islands since the 1970s (Hattori <em>et al.</em> 2005). The most recent estimate is 20 individuals, but at present this is not believed to be an established population.</p>",Decreasing,"Historically, Sea Otters occurred across the North Pacific Rim, ranging  from Hokkaido, Japan, through the Kuril Islands, the Kamchatka  Peninsula, and the Commander Islands, the Aleutian Islands, peninsular  and south coastal Alaska and south to Baja California, Mexico (Kenyon  1969). In the early 1700s, the worldwide population was estimated to be  between 150,000 (Kenyon 1969) and 300,000 individuals (Johnson 1982).  Although it appears that First Nations’ harvests periodically led to  significant local reductions of Sea Otters (Simenstad <em>et al.</em> 1978, Jones <em>et al.</em>  2011), the species remained abundant throughout its range until the  mid-1700s. Following the arrival in Alaska of Russian explorers in 1741,  extensive commercial harvest of Sea Otters over the next 150 years  resulted in the near extirpation of the species throughout the range.  When Sea Otters were afforded protection by the International Fur Seal  Treaty in 1911, it is thought that fewer than 2,000 animals remained in  13 remnant colonies (Kenyon 1969). Remnant populations were located in  Russia (Kuril Islands, Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Commander Islands)  in Alaska (Southwestern Alaska population stock (the Aleutian Islands (two  remnant colonies), Alaska Peninsula (three remnant colonies), and Kodiak  Island (one remnant colony), the South-central population stock (Prince  William Sound), in Canada (Queen Charlotte Islands), in central  California, and in Mexico (San Benito Islands) (Kenyon 1969, Estes  1980). However, the Queen Charlotte, Canada and San Benito Island,  Mexico remnant Sea Otter populations have presumably died out and likely  did not contribute to the recolonization of the species following near  extirpation (Kenyon 1969).<br/><br/>In North America, the current Sea Otter’s range is fairly continuous from the Aleutian Islands to Prince  William Sound with population gaps along the Gulf of Alaska until  Yakutat (which was a translocated population) then another gap in the  population’s distribution until the outer islands of Southeast Alaska  (also a translocated population with Sea Otters from the Aleutian  Islands and Prince William Sound). The next gap in the Sea Otter  population distribution is between Southeast Alaska and British  Columbia, Canada. Translocation efforts were successful in Washington  State but not in Oregon, thus there is a large population gap between  the small sea otter population in Washington and that of central  California.<p></p><p>  </p>","Europeans and Americans first ventured to the North Pacific coast of  America in the late eighteenth century in pursuit of Sea Otter skins. As  the Pacific counterpart to the Atlantic beaver trade, the Sea Otter  trade led trappers into the North Pacific, where they established bases  from the Aleutian Islands to Baja California. In China, Sea Otter furs  were exchanged at good profit for prized oriental goods.<br/><br/>Russia  and Spain were the pioneer nations to engage in the sea otter trade.  After Vitus Bering's expeditions in the early eighteenth century,  promyshlenniki (fur traders) pushed eastward, and in 1784 they  established the first permanent Russian settlement in America, on Kodiak  Island. In the same year, Spain organized a Sea Otter trade between  California and China. At the opening of the nineteenth century, American  and Russian traders entered the California Sea Otter fields, where in  the face of strong opposition they poached throughout the Spanish  period. After 1821, the liberal commercial policy of independent Mexico  stimulated the California Sea Otter trade, and many Americans became  Mexican citizens to participate in the business. Between 1804 and 1807  it is estimated that almost 60,000 pelts were taken by American vessels,  while the period 1808–1812 yielded nearly 50,000.<br/><br/>The Sea Otter  trade ended once commercial hunting was no longer viable and nearly  exterminated the species. In general, the fur trade areas were exhausted  in the order they were opened. Kamchatka and the Aleutians were  depleted by 1790, Kodiak by 1805, Sitka to Nootka Sound by 1820, and  California by 1840. A treaty signed in 1911 by the United States, Great  Britain, Russia, and Japan banned the hunting of Sea Otters. However, Sea Otter trade still exists. Sea Otter pelts are also being sold in  Russia, with at least 300 skins being sold in the black market in Moscow  in summer 2005. Most of these were obtained illegally from the  Commander Islands Biosphere Nature Reserve. Since then we have been  informed that a further 300 Sea Otter skins were being sold openly in  the black market at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, with 200 of them from the  Commander Islands. Most of these skins will be sold on to the markets  in China (IOSF 2006).

It has been recorded up to 476 m above sea level (Goulding <em>et al.</em>2019a). It is absent from heavily fragmented landscapes lacking contiguous forest cover, and absent near some large human populations and areas with a history of past disturbance, e.g. old coconut plantations on NW of Tagula Island (Goulding&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2019).&#160; Forages in and near mangroves and secondary habitat when these habitats are adjoining contiguous forest.

It has been observed most frequently in the canopy layer, followed by the emergent layer and understorey layers (Goulding <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019a). It feeds on arthropods and fruit, including <em>Ficus</em>&#160;species, and occasionally on small vertebrates such as small lizards (Goulding&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019a). It nests in the forks of emergent trees or trees slightly isolated from forest margins, such as on the edge of a river (Goulding <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019a).","<p>Forests on Junet and Panawina are under increasing pressure from subsistence agriculture from growing human populations on Grass and Sabara Islands. Commercial gold prospecting has been occurring in forests of Tagula Island in recent years. Logging has degraded some of the lowland forest on Tagula (Beehler 1993).&#160;In 2019, there were plans to commercially log forest on Tagula Island between Reuwo on the south coast and Rambuso Creek on the north coast. Associated roads have also been discussed, that would dissect the island between these two points and along the north coast to Tagula Station (W. Goulding <em>in litt.</em> 2020). The species avoids highly disturbed habitat and prefers forest with a relatively intact canopy (Goulding <em>et al. </em>2019a). However, forest loss on Tagula has been relatively slow from the 1970s-2010s (Goulding <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Forest loss between 2000 and 2014, caused largely by subsistence gardening, was 1.7% on Tagula, 4.1% on Junet Island, 2.2% on Panawina Island and 0.3% on Sabara Island (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>Changing climate and more extreme weather events such as cyclones may pose a threat to forest integrity and resources for this species (Goulding <em>et al. </em>2016a). Around Araetha village on the north coast of Tagula Island, the number of breeding pairs dropped from five to three after Cyclone Ita in 2014 (W. Goulding <em>in litt. </em>2016). Individuals disappeared that were known by local people to have called from particular locations for numerous years. However, this could have resulted from emigration from the area due to ongoing habitat degradation, rather than from the cyclone (W.

Avian Pox has been observed on Rossel Island, and may pose a risk to this species if it spreads (W. Goulding<em> in litt. </em>2016).

Conservative extrapolation using forest cover greater than 80% (79,200 ha; Hansen <em>et al. </em>2013), combined with the observed densities, suggests that the global population of mature individuals is 11,500 - 23,200, although it was noted that this may be a slight overestimate (Goulding <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2019a).<br/><br/>The island with the largest population is Tagula, which was estimated to have a population of&#160;10,000–21,500 mature individuals (Goulding&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2019a).

Pollution from a sugar cane mill near the town of  Tamazula has made a portion of the former range of the species in the  lower Tamazula River uninhabitable since the 1970’s (Lyons and  Mercado-Silva 2000). Additional pollution from waste water from the town of Tuxpán, and from sewage from a huge paper mill in Atenquique (García 2008), leads to an ongoing decline in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy and quality of habitats. From 1995 to 2016, the species has  been found at about 10 collection sites, several of them moderately large, and recent surveys indicate that probably all of these populations still persist and have been quite stable since the 1980's and 1990's. <br/><br/>Though the best case scenario of the estimated extent of occurence (1,350 km<sup>2</sup>) and area of occupancy (280 km<sup>2</sup>) meets the threshold for Endangered, due to a high number of locations (9&#160; and relatively stable stocks, this species is assessed&#160;Vulnerable.","The Peppered Splitfin&#160;is known to inhabit permanent freshwater rivers in the Río Coahuayana basin in the state of Jalisco and occurs in rocky streams&#160;and riffles over  substrates of sand, rocks and boulders. The vegetation associated to its habitat is typically  green algae, sometimes sparse or asbsent, especially in large rivers where  the species is scarce. The currents are slight or moderate to swift, the  water is turbid or clear. It can be found in depths of 1 m, but usually  it prefers depths of 0.5 m or less.&#160;Like all known&#160;<em>Allodontichthys </em>species, the Peppered Splitfin is a bottom-dwelling and riffle-inhabitating<strong>&#160;</strong>species (Lyons 2011).<br/><br/>Observations of Köck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in March 2016 in the Río Contla about 100 m north of the Highway 110 bridge at Contla, revealed a very shallow habitat with water depths less than 30 cm and a width of 3 to 4 m; in the rainy season the width reaches to about 8m, inferred from the existing pebble shore. The habitat was structured with a few big rocks and boulders in the middle of the current, a lot of gravel of different sizes, mud, sand and silt. There were few patches of submersed vegetation (Characeae) could be seen in the more quiet parts of the creek. The current was mainly swift, the water clear. The water parameters about noon were: pH 7.6, carbonate hardness 3°, total hardness 7°, water temperature 22°C. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, a discharge of polluted water close to the bridge raised the pH to 8.6 and led to the occurence of nitrite (1 mg/l) and nitrate (25 mg/l) that were absent above the discharge pipe.&#160;<em>Allodontichthys tamazulae&#160;</em>was associated with its congener&#160;<em>Allodontichthys hubbsi</em>&#160;(in about the same quantity),&#160;<em>Ilyodon whitei&#160;</em>(dominant species, about 90% of the total number of fish),&#160;<em>Poeclia butleri</em>&#160;and Tilapias (species not determined). The top predator seemed to be Dobsonfly larvae (subfamily Corydalinae, family Corydalidae) of about 10 - 12 cm in length, that could be seen hunting successfully twice in 30 minutes.&#160;<br/><br/>The Río Tamazula east of Tamazula de Giordano has a width of 5 to 10 m with a depth of about 50 cm. The bottom is comprised of big rocks and boulders, gravel, silt, mud and sand. The water in March 2016 was swift to torrential, depending on ground and width, and clear to murky. The water parameters were similar to the ones from the Río Contla. The species was associated with the same fish as in its affluent, and a few&#160;<em>Xenotoca lyonsi </em>were also found. The embankment was comprised by small trees (probably&#160;<em>Salix</em>), reeds and few herbaceous riparian plants; the main sections of the riverbank were free of vegetation. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, viscous remains of burnt sugar cane were found very close by: this would be washed into the river with rain.","<em></em>Water pollution has been identified as main threat for this species. Sewage from a sugar cane mill near the town of Tamazula de Giordano has made a portion of the former range of the species in the lower Tamazula River uninhabitable since the 1970’s (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). Moreover, waste water from a huge paper mill at Atenquique has had a heavilyy negative impact on downstream sections of the Río Tuxpán (García 2008), enhanced by sewage from the town of Tuxpán. Additional threats include wash-in of fertilizers and pesticides from ubiquitous sugar cane fields, in addition to sediment as a result of almost entire deforestation in the headwaters of the Río Atenquique (and other affluents of the Río Tuxpán), along with the Río Tuxpán itself for paper production. It is also threatened by non-native fish species (Tilapias).","From its distribution in two distinct river systems, two subpopulations (the Río El Tule and the Río Tuxpán subopulation) can be inferred. <br/><br/>The Río El Tule subpopulation is probably restricted to the Río El Terrero downstream to sections of this river just below El Pozo Santo and to one of its affluents, the Río La Trampa (Arroyo San José de Tule). Discharges from a sugar cane mill in San José de Tule and sewage from these two towns seem to deteriorate the water quality of this river significantly, making it uninhabitable for this species downstream. Due to its restricted range and declining stocks, this subpopulation is regarded Endangered. <br/><br/>The Río Tuxpán subpopulation was found in the Río Tamazula/Tuxpán system from approximately La Garita downstream to just below Atenquique, encompassing some of its affluents like the ríos Contla and San Grergorio and the arroyos Tecalitlán and Espanatica. This subpopulation is threatened by waste waters from a sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Giordano, making the river section after the town uninhabitable for this species since the 1970's (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). However the species occurred in several surveys by Lyons (1999 - 2010) in the Río Tuxpán, so it seems to persist there though it is scarce (T. Lyons pers. comm. 2018, Köck <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). From most of its affulents, the stocks seem to have remained quite stable since the 1980's and 1990's (Lyons 2011). Taking into consideration the restricted range and population declines in some of the habitats, this subpopulation is regarded Vulnerable.",Decreasing,"The Tuxpán Splitfin is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco, historically widely distributed in the upper sections of the Río Coahuayana (Miller <em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2005), named ríos Tamazula and Tuxpán&#160;(downstream to about the town of San Marcos), and the upper Río El Tule drainage (ríos El Terrero and La Trampa), an affluent of the Río Naranjo, the name of the Río Coahuayana section following the Río Tuxpán. The historical extent of occurrence included several affluents of the ríos Tamazula and Tuxpán, the ríos Contla, San Gregorio (San Jeronimo or Cobianes) and Atenquique, and the arroyos (creeks) Tecalitlán and Espanatica. Due to water pollution caused by sugar cane mills (e.g. Tamazula de Giordano), by sewage from the town of Tuxpán and by a huge paper mill in Atenquique, it is inferred that nowadays the main river is only scarcely populated with this species, and the Río Tamazula past the sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Giordano is thought to be uninhabitable (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). However, it still inhabits the listed affluents and the Río Tamazula above the sugar cane mill; in total, it is known from about 10 collection sites.

The eggs and larvae develop in shallow areas of ponds, lakes, or reservoirs, or in pools of slow-moving streams. The toads undertake seasonal migrations to and from breeding sites; newly metamorphosed young form&#160;large aggregations and migrate en masse to upland foraging areas.This species exhibits breeding site fidelity (COSEWIC 2012).

Eggs are highly susceptible to the pathogenic fungus <em>Saprolegnia ferax</em>, which is most probably introduced during fish stocking (Kiesecker and Blaustein 1997). In the Cascade Range of Oregon, persistent predation of adults by ravens during the toad breeding season appears to have contributed significantly to some population declines (Olson 1992). In Mexico its main threat is habitat degradation through agriculture and pollution of streams (G. Santos-Barrera pers. comm. Red List Assessment 2014).

Several strongholds can be listed: around Talara, particularly to the east and south-east of the town, where the local population is estimated to be 400-600 individuals (Flanagan and Chávez-Villavicencio 2000, Flanagan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009); Islilla, in small forest patches around the Andalucite mining operations, holding c. 100 individuals (Devenish <em>et al</em>. 2020); the sanctuary at Bosque de Pomác historical site in Lambayeque, holding c.270-370 individuals (Nolazco and Roper 2011, Nolazco 2018); around Paiján, La Libertad, where some 200-400 individuals may exist in 200-300 ha of dry scrub as well as in very small patches of suitable habitat amongst farmed land; including near Monte Zarumo, which is possibly the most important site in the south of the range with c. 500 individuals in forest patches within farmed land (C. Devenish <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The well-known site at Rafán (G. Engblom <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 1998, 1999, 2000; Begazo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2001) may support some of the highest population densities—at least 10 birds were observed in 1.5 hours in 1999 (Begazo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001)—but there was as little as 100 ha of suitable habitat in 1998 and high pressure from logging since then will undoubtedly have reduced suitable habitat further (Flanagan<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2009).

178652661,3797,Capra walie,Vulnerable,D1+2,2020,2020-03-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Walia Ibex (<em>Capra walie</em>) is assessed as Vulnerable (VU) under criterion D due to its small population size, which currently is substantially smaller than 1,000 but is now greater than 250 mature individuals. Weakening of current protection could again cause an influx of people, habitat destruction, and poaching. There is also a risk of disease transmission from livestock (e.g., foot and mouth disease, peste de petit ruminants, or contagious caprinae pleuropneumonia), or just an outbreak of unknown origin (e.g., sarcoptic mange). Both threats could rapidly drive the Walia Ibex to CR or EX. The species occurs in only one location: Simien Mountains National Park (SMNP).","<p>Walia Ibex lives in mountainous habitats, sub-afroalpine grasslands and areas with low vegetation cover in the SMNP. The species is an outstanding rock-climber with strong and relatively short legs and hooves that hold the ground better than other ungulates. Hence, it can move safely up and down on steep cliffs (Last 1982). As infants need additional protection against predators, lactating Walia Ibex females prefer habitat ranges in steep and extremely inaccessible cliffs within the park (Nievergelt 1981). <br/><br/>Walia Ibex prefers areas with little or no disturbances, and thus it occupies remote areas in the Simien Mountains National Park (Hurni and Ludi 2000). This species used to be widely distributed from Beyeda along the escarpment to Gich and Adi-Arkay (Last 1982). At the end of 1960s, for example, the main habitat ranges of Walia Ibex were in the central part of the Park, between Gich camp and Imetgogo. In the 1970s, the population had increased and its habitat gradually enlarged towards Sankaber and Chenek–Buahit areas. Currently, the Walia Ibex habitat model indicates that most of its preferred habitats occur from Chenek-Buahit to Mesareria towards the eastern and southeastern parts of the park. </p>","The Simien Mountains National Park (SMNP) has a fragile ecosystem that has faced problems, which are deeply rooted due to the presence of local residences and their related activities (UNESCO 2001). The main problem directly related to the occurrence of Walia Ibex in SMNP is the low protection efficiency of wildlife and ecosystems. Habitat destruction in SMNP by the local people affects the future survival of Walia Ibex (Hurni and Ludi 2000, Schwartz 2009). Livestock grazing inside the SMNP is the main threat to wildlife in general and Walia Ibex in particular (Ejigu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Intensive anthropogenic disturbance near and within the park might be an important issue contributing to the decline of wildlife in general and threatening Walia Ibex in particular. It is known that in addition to human related problems, natural predators such as Leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>) and Hyaena (<em>Hyaena hyaena</em>) are capable of killing Walia Ibex (pers. comm., with park scouts). Moreover, juveniles are usually at great risk from different predators including Wildcats <em>(Felis</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>lybica</em><em>) </em>and Common Jackal (<em>Canis </em><em>aureus</em>) (Dunbar 1978).","<p>Based on a population projection model of Ejigu (2013) the population size of Walia Ibex in the Simien Mountains National Park (SMNP) in 2020 might be over 975 (585 mature) individuals. The population of Walia Ibex numbered 150-300 individuals between 1966-1969 (Nievergelt 1981), increasing slowly until 1983 when there were possibly more than 500 individuals, and then decreasing again during the period of civil unrest during the early 1990s (Wale 2016). Geberemedhin and Grubb (2008) suggested that by 2004 the population had increased to around 500, from lower levels of 200-250 animals in 1994-1996. Ejigu <em>et al</em>. (2013) demonstrated a continuous increase in directly recorded numbers from 680 in 2009 to 790 in 2011 (mean population size from 2009 to 2011 was 752 individuals), with an average increase in recorded numbers by 28. In 2012, according to the SMNP scouts' count, the population of Walia Ibex was estimated at between 800-850 individuals (Wale 2016). Projecting the trend of annual increase from Ejigu <em>et al</em>. (2013) to the following eight years of population growth, the current (2020) population size might be more than 975 individuals. The dry season count in 2019 yielded records of 619 Walia Ibex (AWF 2019), which is lower than the mean of records during 2009-2011 (Ejigu <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, this single record does not change the overall trend of an increasing population size.<br/><br/>According to Ejigu <em>et al</em>. (2013) there are more adult females than other age and sex classes in the herd. Females in general comprised 48.5% of the total population out of which adult females accounted for 38.3%. Adult males and sub-adult males together represented 31.4%, and adult males alone comprised 19.4%. Yearlings and kids together constituted 19.2%. Male to female ratio is 1<strong>:</strong>1.55, indicating that Walia Ibex population is female biased. The ratio of adult males to adult females is 1<strong>:</strong>1.97.<br/><br/>The main reasons for the change in Walia Ibex population size could be expansion of habitat use by the species towards higher altitudes in the southern and southeastern part of the park, and strict conservation of this ibex and its habitat in SMNP both by the local community and the government. As a result, the population of Walia Ibex has increased through time.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Simien Mountains National Park (SMNP)&#160;of Ethiopia is the southernmost limit of <em>Capra</em> species distribution in the world and it is the only place where Walia Ibex occurs (Nievergelt 1981, Gebremedhin <em>et al. </em>2009). Walia Ibex exists in highland massifs of Simien Mountains with altitudes ranging from 2,300 to 4,000 m asl within narrow and restricted habitats (Last 1982, Yalden and Largen 1992). Its main distribution range is in steep, rocky and topographically heterogeneous slopes that are not more than 50 km from east to west along the escarpments and with restricted habitat range between the north and the south (Nievergelt 1981).<br/><br/>Walia Ibex prefers to live in mountainous habitats, sub-afroalpine grasslands and areas with low vegetation cover. Its restricted distribution range in SMNP is a factor to its small total population (Yalden and Largen 1992, Hurni and Ludi 2000). However, Walia Ibex is an outstanding rock-climber with strong and relatively short legs and hooves that hold the ground better. It can move safely up and down on steep cliffs (Last 1982). As infants need additional protection against predators, lactating females prefer habitat ranges in steep and extremely inaccessible cliffs (Nievergelt 1981). <br/><br/>The presence of livestock in ibex habitat has a negative effect on its relative abundance and distribution, causing <em>Capra</em> species to select poor habitats (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2007). Large areas of suitable habitats in SMNP have been abandoned by Walia Ibex as they retreated to the most inaccessible and steepest parts of the Park (Hurni and Ludi 2000, Ejigu 2013, Ejigu <em>et al</em>. 2015). This is because the original Walia Ibex habitats have been changed by intensive human activities in the Park for various uses. Excessive numbers of livestock grazing has a devastating effect on wildlife habitats (Desbiez <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Unless resources are abundant, two populations cannot occupy the same niche at the same place and time (Jonson 2000). Some degree of competition can occur in natural populations (Namgail 2006). Thus, negative interactions will increase the extinction probabilities of a species and result in reduction in the population size (Mielke 1989, Hickman <em>et al. </em>1993). Similar scenarios can also occur in SMNP, where the original habitats of Walia Ibex, especially in Gich area, have been occupied by livestock. The Walia Ibex population is confined to relatively inaccessible habitat ranges within gorges and escarpments towards the eastern part of the Park (Hurni and Ludi 2000). <br/><br/>Habitat preference of a species refers to the disproportionate use of a given habitat in relation to its availability (Block and Brennan 1993). It is most remarkably observed when animals spend a high proportion of time in habitats that are not very abundant in the area. Hence, identification of potential habitats for wildlife is an essential step to ensure its sustainable conservation (Huettmann and Calgary 2003, Desbiez <em>et al</em>. 2009). Habitat preference modelling techniques use information on species location records and environmental factors to generate statistical functions that allow predictions of potentially suitable habitats for the species (Brotons <em>et al. </em>2004). Using a habitat preference model, it is possible to indicate the likelihood of occurrence of a species and enable to find its preferred habitats (Doswald <em>et al</em>. 2007, Hirzel and Le Lay 2008). The model can be identified using different environmental variables in order to predict the presence or absence of a species in a given area. Thus, a habitat preference model can determine the ecological niche of a species through the relationship between observed locations and the environmental parameters that restrict or drive its distribution and abundance (Hirzel and Le Lay 2008).<br/><br/>Different environmental factors and differences in sex, age, life cycle, rank, competition, predation and human disturbances can affect habitat preferences of a species (Ottaviani <em>et al</em>. 2004). Habitat loss is a critical threat to most endangered species and the problem becomes significant in SMNP. Thus, defining the extent of the remaining suitable habitat is a key issue in conservation of Walia Ibex, as conservation intervention is required to protect the remaining habitat (Owen 2009). One approach to infer habitat preference is by directly observing the movement of individuals. However, habitat models based on these types of data often fail to adequately incorporate spatial processes (Rhodes <em>et al</em>. 2005). To overcome this problem, additional data can be collected using presence or absence of pellets. The probability that an individual selects a habitat patch is likely to be dependent not only on habitat type, but also on its spatial context. Different spatial properties such as the individual’s current location, its home range, presence or absence of competitors or predators, and the type of habitat patches may affect the probability of an individual to select its habitat preference (Ottaviani <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rhodes <em>et al</em>. 2005). Land cover classes are commonly described variables used in developing GIS-based habitat preference models. Moreover, variables such as distance to water, density of roads, slope and aspect are also used in determining the model (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 1998). <br/><br/>Walia Ibex prefers areas with little or no disturbances and thus occupy remote areas in the SMNP (Hurni and Ludi 2000). This species used to be widely distributed from Beyeda along the escarpment to Gich and Adi-Arkay (Last 1982). At the end of 1960s, for example, the main habitat ranges of Walia Ibex were in the central part of the Park, between Gich camp and Imetgogo. In the 1970s, the population increased and the habitat was gradually enlarged towards Sankaber and Chenek–Buahit areas. Currently, when applied to the spatial context of quadrats within SMNP, the model indicated that most preferred habitats of Walia Ibex occurred from Chenek-Buahit to Mesareria towards the eastern and southeastern parts of the park. This result was in line with direct observations of Walia Ibex during the study period. Population censuses both during the wet and dry seasons also showed that more than 53% of Walia Ibex population occurred in this area of the park (Ejigu <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>","<p>Since strict conservation measures are carried out by the Community and Government, currently this species is not used or traded.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Walia Ibex is the least known <em>Capra </em>species in the world (Festa-Bianchet 2009, Schwartz 2009). Over the last half a century, Walia Ibexes have been considered one of the most threatened ungulates in the world. Two decades ago, they declined alarmingly in number and only a small population was left in the SMNP (IUCN 2008). Genetic diversity in the Walia Ibex population is low, which may reduce their immunity to diseases and other environmental stochasticity (Gebremedhin <em>et al.</em> 2009) In the past, population estimation of Walia Ibex indicated that the total number might not be greater than 400 head (Massicot 2001, Anonymous 2006). Socioeconomic aspects of the local community and their participation in conservation activities should be considered to bring changes in conducting sustainable conservation to the degraded Simien Mountains (Puff and Nemomissa 2001). Enforcement of conservation policy by law, conservation strategies that could initiate community support and opportunities for the local community to share the available benefits should be designed for effective conservation strategy (UNEP 1990).<br/><br/>As the geographical distribution of Walia Ibex is limited only to SMNP, detailed study of its ecology and population biology (population genetics) is essential to ensure its survival. Obtaining accurate information about this species of concern is essential for its sustainable conservation (Skinner <em>et al</em>. 1977). Effective management of a species depends on detailed study on the biology of the species and its interaction with the environment. Few researchers (Nievergelt 1981, Gebre 2005, and Gebremedhin <em>et al</em>. 2009) have studied different aspects of Walia Ibex. Since SMNP is highly influenced by human related activities (Hurni and Ludi 2000, Ludi 2005), detailed research on different aspects of the park and its wildlife is a must.<br/><br/>In 1978, the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO declared SMNP a World Heritage Site (Hurni and Ludi 2000; Debonnet <em>et al.</em> 2006; Anonymous 2006 2009), based on its importance for biodiversity conservation and exceptional natural beauty (Debonnet <em>et al.</em> 2006). During its establishment, it was the smallest Park in the country, with an area of only 136 km² (Hurni and Ludi 2000). However, since then the area of the Park was extended gradually to include the main habitats of Walia Ibex. Currently, the park boundary includes Limalimo Wildlife Sanctuary, Ras Dejen, some areas in Telemit and Beyeda, with a total area of 412 km² (Anonymous 2009). Thus, conservation of Walia Ibex in SMNP would also benefit the conservation of the endemic Ethiopian wolf (<em>Canis simensis</em>).<br/><br/>Currently, strict conservation measures have been taken in the SMNP including reduction of human and livestock impact in the park; effective implementation of the regulations and establishment of a strong monitoring program. Moreover, a detailed ecological and biological study of the species and habitat assessment on the potential new areas for re-establishment of Walia Ibex is needed to ensure sustainable conservation of Walia Ibex in the SMNP.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
178748090,55267,Alytes maurus,Endangered,"B2ab(iii,v)",2021,2020-07-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Endangered on the basis that this species has a measured area of occupancy (AOO) of 104 km<sup>2</sup> and a maximum AOO less than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. Its population is considered to be severely fragmented, and there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. The detection of the amphibian chytrid fungus in Morocco in 2005, the low densities of animals recorded in surveys of this species and site losses within the Western Rif, together with possible evidence of recruitment failure, suggests that there is likely to be a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals.","This species is generally found in humid sites in montane karst and escarpment areas. Adults inhabit cracks and fissures in rocks, or live under stones close to permanent streams, pools, and other waterbodies. It is commonly found in open forests, agricultural terraces bordered by stone walls and open, rocky valleys in the vicinity of streams or other&#160;water sources (Beukema <em>et al.</em> 2013). Surrounding vegetation may be scrub, cork oak groves, and orchards. Larval development in related species is prolonged and generally takes place in deeper pools within streams or close to springs (R. Marquez pers. comm. 2020) and Martínez del Mármol (2019) report that <em>Alytes maurus&#160;</em>larvae ""can expend much time in development"". The species is therefore expected to be reliant on breeding sites with either permanent water or long hydroperiods (R. Marquez pers. comm. 2020). Females are presumed to transfer eggs to males on land during mating, in common with midwife toads whose breeding has been recorded (P-A. Crochet and R. Marquez pers. comm. 2020). Females produce approximately 60 eggs at a time (with 3-4 clutches a year), which are then carried around outside the water by the male, who releases the larvae back into water at the point of hatching. Its advertisement call is described by&#160;Márquez <em>et al.</em> (2011).","This species is under pressure from a combination of habitat destruction and disease. The amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>) was first detected in northern Morocco, close to this species' distribution, in surveys between 2005 and 2009 (Mouden <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). More than a decade later, it has been detected along the Rif and in the Middle Atlas, and chytrid-induced mortality in this species has been recorded at its eastern range limit (Donaire<em> et al.</em> submitted). This disease has spread rapidly through the related, and ecologically similar,&#160;<em>Alytes dickhilleni&#160;</em>over the past decade and has been implicated in the low population densities of&#160;<em>A. maurus&#160;</em>reported in recent surveys (J. Bosch pers. comm. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Habitat conversion for cropland and associated water extraction is a major threat in the Rif Mountains, which is likely to have resulted in ""severe population fragmentation"" (W. Beukema pers. comm. 2020). An additional pressure exists from overgrazing (S. Fahd pers. comm. 2020). Annual fires, especially in forests, are burning greater areas of natural habitat each year (S. Fahd pers. comm. 2020). The long-hydroperiod water sources on which this species relies are subject to human use and to water livestock, while those in urban areas are subject to rubbish dumping and other forms of water pollution (R. Marquez pers. comm. 2020, ATED 2019). Over the past decade tourist development and industrial development in the Chefchaouen region has expanded, placing additional pressure on permanent water sources (S. Fahd pers. comm. 2020, ATED 2019).&#160;This worker reports that, in both his surveys and those of colleagues, every waterbody found to contain tadpoles of this species was subject to some level of disturbance and potentially at a level that could disrupt the successful recruitment of new cohorts.&#160;<br/><br/>It is also considered to be at risk from the introduction of the predatory fish <em>Gambusia holbrooki</em> to breeding ponds; known sites impacted by fish include Bouhachem Park (S. Fahd pers. comm. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>A reduction in habitat suitability (based on measures of annual precipitation, diurnal period and mean annual temperature) of 18-35% throughout its range by 2050 has been projected under four different climate change scenarios by Rodríguez-Rodríguez e<em>t al. </em>(2020).","A previous (2004) assessment of this species reported that it was locally common in suitable habitat. Subsequently it has been recorded in ""extremely low"" densities in even the best-known localities; this appears to be a genuine decline and is thought to be the result of a high incidence of chytrid fungus (Donaire-Borroso <em>et al</em>. submitted). Although quantitative estimates on rates of decline are not available, current population densities of the related Betic Midwife Toad in Iberia are very low&#160;relative to the preceding 20 years; J. Bosch (pers. comm. 2020) estimates a decline of 10% over the past decade.&#160;This species is likely to exhibit a similar sensitivity to this disease (J. Bosch pers. comm. 2020). In surveys of the western and central Rif mountains since 1990 the species has been recorded from only a small number of scattered localities, where it exhibits low population densities (S. Fahd pers. comm. 2020).

The extent of occurrence (EOO) of its mapped range is 14,459 km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>While these localities may not be continuous, and the major distribution centres in the Atlas and Rif Mountains appear to be disjunct, the low level of variation in mitochondrial DNA suggests recent gene flow throughout the species' range (Pous&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), which these authors suggest is likely to reflect greater connectivity between these areas during the Last Glacial Maximum. Mateo <em>et al.</em> (2013) reidentified two museum specimens from the Tlemcen region of extreme western Algeria as <em>Alytes maurus </em>and subsequently recorded <em>Alytes </em>larvae at this locality in 2006. These specimens have not been located in this collection by another worker, and the species' occurrence in Algeria requires confirmation (E. Rodríguez Rodríguez pers. comm. 2020).

Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Its core breeding areas are located in endemic palm forest dominated by coco de mer <em>Lodoicea maldivica</em>. The species nests in tree cavities mainly in dead coco de mer palms, but they have also been recorded to nest in cavities in other palms and living broadleaf trees (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a), with breeding activity from October to March (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013; Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Deep cavities in hollow <em>L. maldivica</em> trunks with dense canopy cover over the entrance are preferred (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Breeding activity fluctuates widely between years (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016), with approximately one year in four showing minimal or no breeding activity.&#160;In one study, 53% of nests were found to be successful out of 36 nest attempts with 57% fledgling survival to one year (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). It is also found in cultivated areas and residential areas with gardens, which are suitable feeding habitats (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). It feeds on a range of plant species, the majority of which are endemic and native (Reuleaux <em>et al. </em>2014b). It mainly feeds on the fruit pulp, followed by seeds and buds, with occasional observations of feeding on leaves, flowers, bark and scale insects (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014b).","The decline in this species prior to the 1960s is thought to have been driven mainly by predation by introduced rats and hunting by settlers and farmers (Rocamora and Laboudallon  2013). Other causes of increased mortality have included capture for pets and trade and incidental trapping when other species, namely fruit bats, are targeted. The most serious current threats to the species include ongoing nest predation from rats and cats, poaching of its main nesting tree (coco de mer), and habitat destruction caused by  fires, with potential threats including persecution, netting  of bat species and low genetic diversity (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Forest fires may represent the most serious threat to the species, with records since the early 1980s showing that approximately every 10 years a large forest fire occurs (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The availability of nesting cavities may be a limiting factor in very active breeding years, with some females occupying sub-optimal cavities. The poaching of coco de mer nuts could reduce the area of palm forest over the long term, although recent anti-poaching measures appear to be successful.&#160;Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri, </em>which once posed a major threat, have been entirely eradicated from the Seychelles by the Seychelles Islands Foundation. <em>A. krameri </em>carried diseases such as Beak and Feather Disease Virus, which was a serious threat for <em>C. barklyi </em>(Fogell <em>et al.</em> 2018). The impacts of introduced species through nest predation and competition for nest-sites may not yet be serious enough to limit the population; however, mynahs are increasing on Praslin (Dueker 2018). Invasive yellow crazy ants are an emerging threat, with numbers having increased substantially in Praslin's palm forest habitat from 2015-2018. The ants have caused at least two <em>C. barklyi</em> nest failures. Yellow crazy ants are now being controlled with a baiting programme across the Vallée de Mai and other parts of Praslin's remaining palm forest (N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2020). Predation of fledglings by cats and dogs is probably limited and post-fledging mortality is not currently a major concern as most fledglings are seen again in the year after they fledge (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). Another risk factor for the species is the substantial and so-far unexplained fluctuations in its breeding activity, with minimal or no breeding occurring approximately every four breeding seasons (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data).","Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% confidence intervals) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. The most recent point count survey in 2018 estimated a population of 1392 (1096-1742, 95% CI) individuals. On the basis of this new data, it is assumed that there are 730-1170 mature individuals in the population.",Stable,"<em>Coracopsis barklyi</em> is resident on Praslin, with occasional non-breeding records on Curieuse (c.1 km north of Praslin), <strong>Seychelles </strong>(Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% CI) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  No individuals were detected on Curieuse during point counts over four  days and during supplementary fieldwork, thus it is assumed that there  is no resident population there (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Prior to the surveys by Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. (2013), the most recent  population estimate on Praslin was of 645 individuals (95% confidence  intervals: 404-1,034 individuals), using distance sampling at 39 random  points (Walford 2008). However, this study was deemed to have several  methodological and analytical constraints, which meant that assumptions  of the distance sampling method were not met (Walford 2008; Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013) and resulting in an estimate range that was considered too broad to serve as a basis for conservation planning (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. A review of previous survey results indicates that this species&#160;has recovered from a low point of c.30-50 individuals in one area of the island in the late 1960s,  increasing until the at least the turn of the century, with uncertainty  over the trend since then (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013; Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Surveys in 2018 produced a population estimate of 1382 (1096-1742, 95% CI) individuals on Praslin (Dueker 2018), however this cannot be directly compared to the 2011 population estimate due to differences in survey seasons, which affects the vocalisations (the main detection method) of this parrot.",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species has been protected by law since 1966 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Endemic palms have been protected since 1991, and the restoration of native palm forest on Praslin and Curieuse is on-going. The species occurs in Praslin National Park, which was established in 1979, and the Vallée de Mai was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Fond Ferdinand and Curieuse island are managed as nature reserves, but they lack official protected status. Fond Peper, an area of mature palm forest of approximately 60 ha, adjacent to the Vallée de Mai, and another area of high quality black parrot breeding habitat, is now also under the management of Seychelles Islands Foundation and being prioritised for conservation. Artificial nest boxes were provided between 1983 and c.2005 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013; A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016), although these are now no longer in use, with no apparent ill effects to the population (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data).<br/>There is a firebreak around the core breeding area at Vallée de Mai,   but it is not guaranteed to work in the event of a large fire which   cannot be quickly contained (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>.  2014). The firebreak proved to be only partially effective when a fire destroyed several hectares of high quality breeding habitat in the south of Praslin in 2010 (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). The poaching of coco de mer nuts is being counteracted with  increased security and a regeneration programme, and awareness-raising  activities have been conducted to reduce persecution by farmers. Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri </em>were eradicated from Mahé&#160;in 2019 (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). An experimental trial to assess the effects of rat control on <em>C. barklyi</em> breeding success was carried out in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. And intensive baiting programme to control yellow crazy ants began in 2019 (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). <br/>A national action plan for the species was produced in 2009 and includes plans to introduce the species to Silhouette, along with captive breeding on Frégate Island and North Island if appropriate habitat restoration and management can be carried out (reviewed by Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Other conservation actions identified for this species include the control of introduced species, population monitoring and public awareness campaigns (reviewed by Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Analysis using statistical models is planned in 2014 after annual counts have been conducted for three years without interruption, and  conclusions regarding the species trend since 1982 will be published  (G.

Due to the ongoing conservation work, there is no longer believed to be a continuing decline in population size, or in the quality or area of the species's habitat. The species therefore no longer qualifies as Endangered. However, the population size remains small (&lt;1,000 mature individuals) and so the species qualifies as Vulnerable. Numbers fluctuate owing to predation and disease, and it seems doubtful that present populations could be maintained without the current intense management programme.<p></p>","The species inhabits native forest and has a diverse diet, including both native and exotic plants (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. In the early 1990s, the entire wild population nested in a single grove of introduced Japanese red cedar <em>Cryptomeria japonica</em>. However, ongoing studies suggest that rat predation in <em>Cryptomeria</em> is higher than in native vegetation, thus the value of <em>Cryptomeria</em> is unclear (Carter 1998; Swinnerton 2001)<strong></strong>. When restored native vegetation is available for nesting, birds use this in preference over exotic species. The species is territorial and breeds during the dry season (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). All subpopulations may have a skewed sex ratio, with males outnumbering females (Bunbury 2006); this may explain the occasional presence of male pairs in this species, which hold a territory and build a nest together (Jones <em>et al. </em>1992).<p></p>","Severe loss of habitat has been compounded by continued predation of nests and adults by introduced Crab-eating Macaque <em>Macaca fascicularis</em>, mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, rats and feral cats (Reese Lind 1994; Swinnerton 2001)<strong></strong>. Invasive plant species reduce the quality of breeding and foraging habitat. Cyclones destroy nests and accelerate habitat degradation (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Natural food shortages mean that birds must be provided with supplementary food, and these food shortages are exacerbated by competition over resource with rats, exotic birds and macaques&#160;(Jones and Owadally 1988). The disease trichomonosis was brought to Mauritius by alien pigeons (which now act as a reservoir for the disease), a<strong></strong>nd 359 (84.3%) of 429 individual birds screened between 2002-2004 tested positive for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Trichomonas gallinae</span> at least once; however, pathogenicity was found to be low, with active signs of the disease recorded in only 1.9% of birds which tested positive (Bunbury <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Nevertheless, the disease causes significant levels of mortality, especially in juveniles, and it is likely to be limiting population growth (<strong></strong>Swinnerton <em>et al. </em>2005; Bunbury <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). The blood parasite <em>Leucocytozoon marchouxi</em>&#160;may also cause mortality, especially in juveniles (Bunbury 2006).&#160;Inbreeding depression is an ongoing concern (Swinnerton <em>et al. </em>2004)<strong></strong>. This species also may treat calls of the invasive Madagascar Turtle-dove <em>Nesoenas picturata </em>as if they were conspecific; and while there is currently no evidence for hybridisation, males may put more effort into territory defence, which might have a negative impact on breeding success (Wolfenden <em>et al. </em>2015).<p></p>","Jones <em>et al. </em>(2013) estimated the population to number 370-380 individuals in total. The species does undergo fluctuations, and over recent years the&#160;<em>known&#160;</em>wild population has ranged from c.325 to c.410 individuals, while the&#160;<em>possible</em>&#160;wild population has ranged from c.375 to c.490 individuals (N.

Although once common, it declined to just 10 wild individuals in 1990, and were it not for intervention, it would have rapidly gone extinct. Since then, intensive management has resulted in a spectacular increase, although the population is still dependent on ongoing intensive management. Since 2000, the population has remained above 300 individuals. Numbers have fluctuated, but in 2007 there were 380 birds (C. Jones <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>, in 2010 the population was estimated at 376-493 birds (V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2010) and in 2011 estimated at 365 known individuals from six subpopulations&#160;(five in the national park [Pigeon Wood, Camp, Bel Ombre, Combo, and Lower Black River Gorges], and one on Ile aux Aigrettes), and so a possible total population of 370-380 individuals (Jones <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In 2020 the population was estimated at 308 known individuals (S. Henshaw 2020, pers. comm.).&#160;Releases have now occurred at an additional three sites, Petrin, Ferney Valley, and Ebony Forest (Tatayah 2013, C. Jones <em>in litt. </em>2017). In 2007, of the five (then) established subpopulations, two were in decline (Plaine Lievre c.110 birds and Bel Ombre c.48 birds), two were increasing (Pigeon Wood c.65 birds and Combo c.65 birds), and the subpopulation on Ile aux Aigrettes was believed to have reached carrying capacity and to be stable at 85 birds (<strong></strong>K.

Therefore, it is listed as Near Threatened.","This species occupies a variety of habitats generally associated with open areas and short vegetation (Yosef and International Shrike Working Group&#160;2017). This includes parkland, pastures, open woodland, orchards and agricultural land with hedgerows and perching sites (such as fences) and impaling sites for storing food (e.g. barbed wire or vegetation with thorns/spines) (Yosef 1996, Yosef and International Shrike Working Group 2017). Shrike habitat typically includes four 'common elements': 1) foraging areas, typically bare ground and exposed rock, 2) nesting sites, usually small trees and shrubs, 3) perching sites, and 4) impaling sites, often barbed wire, thorns of sharp branches (Pruitt 2000, A. Chabot <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species typically feeds on arthropods, amphibians, and small mammals, birds and reptiles, such as the&#160;<em>Thamnophis sirtalis infernalis</em> (Hughes 2019, Yosef 2020).","Several ideas have been presented that may account for declines in this species (see Lymn and Temple 1991), including pesticides (Anderson and Duzan 1978), fire ant presence in wintering habitats (Lymn and Temple 1991), West Nile Virus (Bertelsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Smallwood and Nakomoto 2009) and habitat fragmentation and loss, particularly through conversion to agricultural land. The Loggerhead Shrike has been evidenced to be significantly more abundant in better connected areas of suitable habitat (Froehly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) whilst occupancy significantly increases in areas with greater than 15-25% habitat suitability (A. Chabot <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Migratory connectivity is known to be greater in western <em>L. ludovicianus</em>&#160;populations where the impacts of habitat loss on populations are thought to be reduced, hence western populations may be at comparatively less risk than eastern populations (Chabot <em>et al</em>. 2018). Habitat loss and fragmentation are therefore thought to only be of regional significance, hence in other locations additional factors must be responsible for limiting Loggerhead Shrikes and driving the witnessed declines (Brooks and Temple 1990, Froehly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;The species may have also been persecuted and shot in the past, but this has likely reduced (Yosef 1996).&#160;While the use of certain pesticides is now prohibited in U.S.A. the potential effects of other threats may be likely to continue into the future (Pruitt 2000, COSEWIC 2014). Collisions with vehicles contribute to the species's decline as roads display a number of essential habitat features; 29% of all <em>L. ludovicianus</em>&#160;winter mortality in Virginia has been attributed to collisions on roads (Blumton 1989). Furthermore, intraspecific competition on wintering grounds between migrants and resident shrikes that occupy territories year round likely contributes to the decline of obligant migrant populations of Loggerhead Shrike in north-eastern North America (Brooks and Temple 1990; Cade and Woods 1997; Pruitt 2000; COSEWIC 2000). Loss of habitat in wintering areas may exacerbate competition (Lymn and Temple 1991).&#160;Extreme local weather conditions have been implicated in declines as a result of high nest failure rates (e.g., nest abandonment or loss of young birds during cold wet breeding seasons, especially with heavy rains [Pruitt 2000]) and such threats may increase as stormy conditions are exacerbated under a changing global climate (COSEWIC 2014, Environment Canada 2015a).&#160;Predation of shrikes by a variety of species, including cats, raccoons, crows, magpies, and several raptors has been observed (Blumton 1989; Wiggins 2004) but the significance has not been evaluated. Predation by feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) impacts the endemic subspecies <em>L. l. mearnsi</em>&#160;on San Clemente Island, California, U.S.A. (Gustafson <em>et al</em>. 2020).","Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population to total 7,000,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is a widespread breeder across much of the <strong>U.S.A. </strong>and <strong>Mexico</strong>, extending into southern <strong>Canada </strong>in the breeding season.

The species was incorporated into the Canadian Wildlife Service's Operation Grasslands Community (Yosef 1996) whilst a targeted recovery strategy was developed and implemented in 2015 for subspecies <em>migrans</em>&#160;in Canada, aimed at re-establishing a viable population of the subspecies in Canada where less than 100 wild individuals remain (Environment Canada 2015a). This species has been&#160;successfully reared in captivity with captive-reared juveniles released to augment populations in Ontario and Quebec (as well as San Clemente Island, California); over 400 juveniles released between 2001-2010 with ~76% of such individuals thought to survive from release to migration initiation (Imlay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Nichols&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Lagios&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).

The vast majority of records come from the rainy season, i.e. from mid-October until late May. The species is found along a gradient from low elevation (0-250 m), disturbed areas (Becker<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2000, Ridgely and Greenfield 2001) to more intact, higher elevation (250-750 m), misty ""garúa"" (low-level cloud) forest in the hills of the Cordillera Chongón-Colonche (Ágreda&#160;2007). A record from a garden (J. Croxall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011) shows tolerance for degraded habitat and is thought to regularly breed in these areas (B. Harris <em>in litt</em>. 2020). However, it has to be considered that the species is not completely adaptable to degraded habitats and open areas as observations in such regions may be due to greater accessibility, with disturbed habitats continuing to limit its widespread occurrence (J. Freile <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It will also avoid large urbanized areas and agricultural fields, staying clear of banana, balsa, cacao, oil palm, pineapple, and rice or other monocultural landscapes particularly across central Pacific Ecuador (J. Freile&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). It generally breeds in lower elevation, disturbed areas and foothills along the central Ecuadorian coast and move to northwestern Ecuador for the non-breeding season (Harris <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Juiña&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010).&#160;A male studied in 2005 fed mainly in a flowering patch of understorey herb <em>Razisea</em><span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>(Ágreda&#160;2007).

Horstman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). A total of 21 active nests were encountered between October and April, at 30-350 m elevation and within 14 km of the sea (Harris<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2009, Juiña <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).

Breeding success however has not been formerly determined, with nesting failure thought to be high due to the use of narrow river beds that may tend to overflow (Juiña <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010, A. Ágreda <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>","Although current estimates show marginal forest loss (Global Forest Watch 2020), all forest-types within its range have greatly diminished owing to logging and agricultural clearance<strong> </strong>(Dodson and Gentry 1991, Best <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Persistent grazing by goats and cattle damages the understorey, prevents regeneration and is a serious current threat<strong> </strong>(Dodson and Gentry 1991,<strong> </strong>Pople <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. Habitat destruction is particularly persistent along the coastal Ecuadorian dry forest (Portillo-Quintero and Sanchez-Azofeifa 2010). Further habitat loss continues, at least in unprotected areas, and could remove almost all extant forest<strong> </strong>(Dodson and Gentry 1991). Uncontrolled forest fires are a major threat to forest in the Cordillera Chongón-Colonche (E. Horstman <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>2000, 2008). Even in Machalilla, its habitat is threatened by illegal settlement, deforestation, livestock-grazing and habitat clearance by people with land rights (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2000, Harri<span style=""font-style: italic;"">s et al.</span> 2009). More recently, parasitism by <em>Philornis </em>sp. may be a potential threat, however exact effects remain unknown (Bulgarella <em>et al</em>. 2019). An emerging factor is also vulnerability to climatic events such as La Niña which creates drier periods and El Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSO), that creates intense winter overflows of rivers, especially throughout the Coastal Cordillera Chongon Colonche region (A. Ágreda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<p></p>","Based on estimated population densities of 0.9-1.8 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>,&#160;the population was conservatively thought to number a maximum of 2,000-4,000 individuals, roughly converted to 1,250-2,750 mature individuals (Ágreda 2020). Albeit, considering that this may be overestimated, the population could number as low as 1,000-3,000 individuals, equating to 625-2,060 mature individuals (J. Freile <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Further information suggests that the population may number at c. 500-1,800 individuals, possibly reaching up to 2,000 individuals with any number of subpopulation unlikely to exceed 1,000 mature individuals (H. M. Schaefer&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Based on high levels of uncertainty and best available information therefore, the population has been placed in the band of 1,000-2,700 mature individuals, roughly equating to 1,600-3,900 individuals. The population is further thought to exist in at least 4-5 subpopulations at Jama, Pacoche, Cantagallo-Ayampe, Loma Alta and San Francisco-Galerita (M. Moens&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). However, the Chongon Colonche mountain range may equally represent only one single subpopulation (J. Freile&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Thus, it is tentatively assumed that there are 2-5 subpopulations within the species's range.",Decreasing,"<em>Chaetocercus berlepschi</em> is restricted to a small area of west <strong>Ecuador</strong> (Esmeraldas, Manabí, and Santa Elena), where it is very rare and localised (fewer than 20 known sites). The species has never been found in the Guayas province (A. Ágreda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Very little suitable habitat remains, however the species's fragmented&#160;distribution is not considered to be a major problem due the ability of the species to disperse well (B. Harris <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Small numbers persist from San Lorenzo (Manabí) south to Manglaralto (Santa Elena; B. Harris <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Manabí, it also occurs in Reserva Jama, Pacoche, and Reserva Cantagallo (M. Moens <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;It also nests along the Valdivia river near the village of El Suspiro, Loma Alta (D. Becker <em>in litt</em>. 2017). The species's stronghold may be in the vicinity of the río Ayampe and Machalilla National Park (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2000, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). It breeds along the coast between October and March (Juiña <em>et al</em>. 2010), but is absent during other months, when it apparently migrates to the subtropics (Fogden 2012). However, any seasonal or altitudinal movements may be limited by increased habitat disturbance along coastal regions (J. Freile <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In 1993, it was found near Súa, Esmeraldas, in an area severely threatened by logging<strong> </strong>(Best <em>et al.</em> 1996), and in 1998, one male was recorded on Isla de la Plata (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2000). Several males were observed in the Loma Alta Communal Reserve, Santa Elena, in December 2002 and 2003, and a male was at Dos Mangas Communal Reserve, Santa Elena in December 2005 (Ágreda&#160;2007). During 2007-2008, 11 new localities were found in the lowlands of Manabí and Santa Elena (Harris<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009). In 2017,&#160;it was also found in the Muisne-San Francisco Galeras area, Esmeraldas, during the breeding season (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020).

It is found in open and semi-open areas along the coast, but also in pastures, agricultural lands and secondary scrub (Luo 2020). It was thought to nest in holes in cliffs, trees or buildings, but recently discovered colonies were typified by nests built on a substrate of saltpetre or on dry-stone walls. Nests are similar to those of Markham's Storm-petrel (<em>Hydrobates markhami</em>) and Wedge-rumped Storm-petrel (<em>H. tethys</em>), and the colony-holding islands have a low density of guano birds (K.

The species may undergo local post-breeding movements, as numbers in south Peru increase between January and April. <p></p>","Threats to the species are unknown. Given the ecology of Peruvian Martin, it has been hypothesised that the species may be impacted by competition for nest sites with seabirds and nest predation, but potentially also intensification of agriculture and subsequent pesticide use (F.

This equates to 3,750-14,999 mature individuals, rounded here to 3,500-15,000 mature individuals; however, this may be an underestimate. In recent years, the species is more regularly observed in Chile, which may be attributable to an increase in survey effort, rather than to an increase in population size (F.

Nest building begins in early to mid-March, and eggs may be laid until mid-May (Ladd and Gass 1999, J. Reidy<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;in litt</span>. 2012, J.

Although productivity appears to be higher in Texas Red Oak (<em>Quercus buckleyi</em>) habitat compared to Post Oak (<em>Q. stellata</em>) (Marshall <em>et al. </em>2013),&#160;Campomizzi <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that the relationship between reproductive success and habitat conditions varies across the breeding range.<br/><br/>In winter, it occurs predominantly in pine-oak forested habitats in mixed-species flocks, foraging at sites with a high density of ""encino"" oaks (in comparison to pines and other oak species) at 1,100-3,000 m (Vidal <em>et al. </em>1994, Thompson 1995, Ladd and Gass 1999, Rappole <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2000, King <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2012) and oaks appear to be essential in the wintering habitat (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018). It was thought to have a wider winter habitat tolerance (and may be tolerant of moderate levels of logging and grazing [Rappole <em>et al</em>. 1999]<strong></strong>), but this requires substantiation (J. Sterling <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Breeding habitat is subject to clearing for land development and agriculture (Ladd and Gass 1999), leading to increased habitat fragmentation, which can&#160;impair gene flow (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008; Athrey <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011),&#160;and increase nest predation and brood parasitism (Pulich 1976, Peak 2007, Reidy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009b, Sperry <em>et al. </em>2009); thus reducing productivity (Peak and Thompson 2014). Long-term changes in this species's habitat have been documented (Heger 2012, Heger and Hayes in prep.), such that (based on only a portion of the range) potentially 23% of suitable breeding habitat was lost between 1993-94 and 2004-05 and 33% lost from 2004-05 to 2016. Duarte <em>et al. </em>(2013) additionally found a 29% reduction in total breeding habitat between 1999-2001 and 2010-11.&#160;Moreover, both Duarte <em>et al</em>. (2016a) and Diamond <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that lost habitat was unlikely to regenerate after a habitat patch was cleared. The 2011 drought and 2015 floods have potentially had an additional impact on habitat loss (Heger and Hayes in prep<em>.,&#160;</em>Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests <em>in litt. </em>2018), though these will have been incorporated as part of the Heger and Hayes (in prep) analyses. The 2011 drought also reinforced efforts to try to eradicate Ashe junipers (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;Importantly, habitat loss and fragmentation can lead to reduced connectivity across habitat patches and connectivity has been found to be essential to maintain species viability at both the local (Duarte et al. 2016b) and range-wide scale (Duarte <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<br/><br/>The decline may also be being driven by forest fires, logging and firewood-extraction, and agricultural conversion for cattle reducing pine-oak habitats in its wintering range (Ladd and Gass 1999,&#160;Rappole <em>et al</em>. 2003a, J. Lyons&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999, Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018)<strong></strong>. Millions of hectares of forest burned between 1998 and 2016, which is equivalent to 33% of total area of the ecoregion (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018). It is thought that suitable wintering habitat may be considerably more limited than that available in the breeding range with wintering habitat able to support just 15% of the population that could be supported by breeding habitat (Rappole <em>et al</em>. 2003b). Forest loss throughout this species's entire range is currently estimated at ~3.6% across a ten year period (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). An infestation of Southern Pine Beetle (<em>Dendroctonus frontalis</em>) since 2015, particularly in Honduras, has had a significant impact on forests in the wintering range, increasing the risk of catastrophic fires (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018).<br/><br/>A range of other factors could also have an influence on the species and its habitat. Predation of incubating females by rat snakes (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Elaphe </span>spp.) (and potentially other nest predators [C. Harper <em>in litt. </em>2016]) appears to be an important contributor to adult mortality, accounting for perhaps 15% of breeding female deaths (Reidy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a). White-tailed Deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>), invasive Wild Boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), invasive plants and oak wilt fungus (<em>Ceratocystis fagacearum</em>) and increasing wildfire risk may all impact the habitat (Russell and Fowler 1999, Juzwik <em>et al. </em>2008, USFWS 2014), while Tawny Crazy Ant&#160;(<em>Nylanderia fulva</em>)&#160;is expanding its range into central Texas, so could be a potential threat (LeBrun <em>et al. </em>2013, Kumar <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;Adult mortality from vehicle and window strikes has also been reported (Reidy <em>et al.</em> 2018). Increasing anthropogenic noise, particularly via road construction, has also been considered as a threat however, recent studies have not evidenced any effect from such changes on the species (Lackey <em>et al</em>. 2011; Long <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). Climate change is also thought to have significant impacts on the species, as its Ashe juniper dominated woodlands are likely to be unable to shift with shifting climate in the breeding range (EPA 2009), and some tree species in the non-breeding range may contract their range by 50% by 2050 (Goméz-Mendoza and Arriaga 2007). A petition in the state of Texas is also currently attempting to have the species's Endangered species status removed, significantly threatening the habitat in which it resides (USFWS 2016, Doyle 2020).<p></p>","There is&#160;currently only one range-wide estimate of abundance for the species (Mathewson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Mathewson <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted point count surveys in a subset of randomly selected habitat patches (301 patches total) across the breeding range in 2008–2009 and found density was most related to the predicted patch-specific occupancy probability based on the work of Collier <em>et al</em>. (2012). They estimated range-wide abundance for male birds to be ca. 262,013 (95% CI: 223,131 – 302,620). Using the density estimates of Mathewson <em>et al</em>. (2012), Hatfield<em> et al</em>. (2012) estimated there were ca, 11,600 – 18,300 male birds on conservation, recreation, and Department of Defense lands. Although other density estimates have been calculated for the species (i.e. Peak 2011, USFWS 2014, O’Donnell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Reidy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, amongst others),&#160;these estimates are based on individual parcels of land and ignore the spatial variability in densities across the breeding range.

There is no consensus on the extent of suitable habitat within the species's wintering range, and its ecological integrity has not been established as to assess the conditions required to maintain optimal wintering populations (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica <em>in litt. </em>2018).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Within the breeding range, federal lands that provide long-term protection include Department of Defense lands (U.S. Army Fort Hood, U.S. Air Force Joint Base San Antonio-Camp Bullis, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) and Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Lower Colorado River Authority, The Nature Conservancy, and other cities, counties, and conservation organizations also own lands within the breeding range. Land management practices vary, but many of these lands are managed compatibly for this species (Groce<em> et al.</em> 2010, USFWS 2014).&#160;In the USA, it is listed on the Federal Endangered species list and has a recovery plan (USFWS 1992, Ladd and Gass 1999), although there is ongoing action within the state of Texas, despite the efforts of the USFWS, to have such Endangered species status removed (USFWS 2016, Doyle 2020). Several regional habitat conservation plans have been approved or are under development (Ladd and Gass 1999, J. Lyons <em>in litt.</em> 1999), including the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve in western Travis County (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018). Control of invasive species is being attempted in the breeding range, e.g. in Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (W. Reiner and J. Scalise&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018). Efforts to protect the wintering range include the Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica, which was formed in 2003, and consists of institutions located in the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Alliance (2008) developed a conservation plan for the ecoregion with the goal of conserving pine-oak forest habitat. This conservation plan represents the first regional management, conservation, and sustainable development effort for pine-oak forests with the purpose of promoting and sustaining biodiversity, water, timber, recreation, and sustainable rural development (USFWS 2014).<br/>Since the species was listed on the Federal Endangered species list, habitat mapping, population monitoring, and viability analyses have increased our knowledge of species distribution, habitat requirements, and threats within the breeding range (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018). In 2017, the Department of Defense and USFWS initiated efforts to track movements between the breeding and wintering range using geolocators (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;Surveys in 2006-10 and 2014-8 have improved knowledge of its wintering distribution and trends (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018).

However, recent population surveys across parts of the breeding range found substantially more penguins than previously thought, raising questions about the validity of previous estimates. The species is still suspected to be declining, but the population is considerably larger than the thresholds for listing as Vulnerable. There is no current evidence for rapid declines, but the high level of uncertainty in the rate of population reduction means that the species is now listed as Near Threatened. Further monitoring aimed at deriving population trends is required.","This species breeds in loose colonies along stretches of coastline in habitats ranging from mature temperate rainforest and dense scrub, to coastal caves and rocky shorelines. Penguins arrive at their breeding sites from mid-June onwards, with most nests established by mid-July. Two eggs are laid, which are incubated by both parents and hatch after 33 days (Warham 1974). Chicks fledge around mid- to late November. A diet study on the West Coast found that penguins brought predominantly squid (85%) ashore, followed by krill (13%) and fish (2%) (van Heezik 1989). Penguins from Codfish Island/Whenua Hou&#160;took primarily fish (85%) and squid (15%) (van Heezik 1990). Breeding penguins show site-dependent differences in foraging ranges, with birds from the Jackson Head, West Coast, and Open Bay foraging within 20-100 km radii from their breeding colonies, while penguins breeding in Milford Sound remained within the fiord most of the time (foraging radius &lt;10 km) (Mattern and Ellenberg 2016; Poupart <em>et al</em>., 2019).&#160;On Codfish Island/Whenua Hou, Fiordland penguins were found to forage either very close inshore (&lt;500 m of the island’s coast, presumably foraging in kelp forest) or travelled to deeper waters about 20-40 km west of the island (Mattern and&#160;Ellenberg 2018). Outside the breeding season, Fiordland penguins forage deep into the sub-antarctic south of Australia (Mattern<em> et al. </em>2018, Mattern <em>et al. </em>unpublished data).<p></p>","Introduced terrestrial predators are an imminent threat. Stoats <em>Mustela erminea&#160;</em>are considered the most significant predator of the species at present (Ellenberg 2013, Wilson and Long 2017), with three trapped in 2016 following observations of stoats preying upon chicks at Jackson's Bay colony (Mattern and Ellenberg 2016). In this and the preceding year productivity at this site was very low, but improved in 2017 (Mattern and Ellenberg 2016). Dogs also represent a potentially significant predator, particularly when moulting adults are confined ashore for 20-30 days, during which time a single dog would have the potential to wipe out a whole colony (DOC 2012). Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em>, rats <em>Rattus </em>spp., Weka <em>Gallirallus australis&#160;</em>(Marchant and Higgins 1990, Mattern 2013) and Common Brushtail Possum&#160;<em>Trichosurus vulpecula&#160;</em>are also potential predators, but they appear to have negligible impacts on Fiordland Penguin populations (Mattern and Ellenberg 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Resource competition with squid fisheries (Ellis <em>et al. </em>1998) and bycatch are both threats imposed by local fisheries. In 2011 annual bycatch mortality was estimated to be between 38-176 birds (Ellenberg 2013) with set nets of particular concern close to shore or within the fiords themselves (e.g. Milford Sound). Birds are occasionally disturbed by humans at nest-sites (Ellenberg <em>et al. </em>2015), with human disturbance in the more accessible colonies in South Westland anecdotally attributed as causing nest failures and a decline in population (Wilson and Long 2017; DOC 2012). Small numbers are killed on roads (DOC 2012). The pathogen <em>Leucocytozoon tawaki</em> has been identified from the species, but infections are of low prevalence and there appear to be no ill-effects reported (Jones and Shellam 1999). Pollution could become a major threat if proposed deep-sea oil exploration off the West Coast proceeds (Mattern 2013), and oil spills represent an&#160;ongoing, chronic threat with potential for a dramatic incident, most likely limited to a portion of the breeding range. El Niño events were found to have a detrimental effect on the breeding success of Fiordland penguins from the West Coast, although penguins breeding in Fiordland seem to be less affected by the climate phenomenon (Mattern and Ellenberg 2016).<p></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Previously, the population has been estimated at c.5,500-7,000 mature individuals (Mattern 2013, Long 2017). More recently, population counts across parts of the species’s breeding range (Southwestland, Milford Sound, Stewart Island) suggest a considerably higher population number (Mattern and Wilson 2019).&#160;Due to the cryptic breeding habit and resulting difficulty of surveying the species, previous surveys have almost certainly underestimated the true population size considerably (Mattern 2013). Extrapolating from recent data, Mattern and&#160;Wilson (2019) suggest that the Fiordland penguin population more likely ranges between 12,500-50,000 mature individuals.</p><p></p> <p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-US""><em>Eudyptes pachyrhynchus</em><span lang=""EN-US""> nests on the west to south-west coast of the South Island,&#160;<strong>New Zealand</strong>, from Bruce Bay in South Westland, to Coal Island in southern Fiordland. They are also found breeding on Solander Island, Codfish Island/Whenua Hou, along with Stewart Island and several of its offshore islands (Mattern and Wilson 2019).&#160;Non-breeding dispersal ranges from the subtropical front to the polar front with most birds foraging along the sub-antarctic front, travelling up to 3,000 km away to the Southwest of New Zealand. During the non-breeding season, birds have been observed on the Snares, Auckland, Campbell and Macquarie Islands.

As part of a five-year project commenced in&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">2014, the marine ecology (foraging ranges, diving behaviour, diet composition) of breeding Fiordland penguins was studied across their entire breeding range; the project also investigated the pre-moult dispersal of adult penguins (Mattern and Ellenberg 2016; Mattern and Ellenberg 2020). The species’s non-breeding migration will be investigated between 2016 and 2021 (S. Waugh, <em>pers. comm.</em>). A video monitoring study examines the impact of introduced terrestrial predators on breeding Fiordland penguins (Wilson and Long 2015). Population surveys are being carried out at additional sites throughout South Westland and Stewart Island which have not been surveyed recently, or at all (R.

182550979,22720855,Palmeria dolei,Critically Endangered,"B1ab(i,ii,iii,v)",2021,2020-08-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has an extremely small range. Its population size and extent of habitat are declining, probably as a result of the encroachment of avian malaria into higher elevations as temperatures increase due to climate change. For these reasons, it is listed as Critically Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","It occurs in mesic 'ohi'a-koa and wet 'ōhi'a forest from 1,100-2,300 m (99% above 1,500 m, mostly below 2,100 m). It primarily feeds on 'ōhi'a nectar, also taking invertebrates, especially caterpillars. When 'ōhi'a bloom is at its seasonal low, it feeds on subcanopy and understorey flowers and fruit (Berger 1972; Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986; P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999; J. C. Simon <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. All known nests have been in 'ōhi'a trees (Berlin and VanGelder 1999)<strong></strong>. It raises 1-2 young per nest, usually nesting twice seasonally (November to June [<strong></strong>Simon <em>et al. </em>2001]<strong></strong>), and has a relatively high success rate (J. C. Simon <em>in litt.</em> 1999; <strong></strong>Simon <em>et al. </em>2001)<strong></strong>. Adult survivorship is similarly high (<strong></strong>Simon <em>et al. </em>2001)<strong></strong>. Birds, perhaps especially immatures, may disperse to lower elevations (<strong></strong>Berlin and VanGelder 1999)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Habitat destruction and modification and the rapid spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the lowlands are thought to be responsible for past declines. There has been extensive historic loss of forest within the species's range, through logging and clearance for agriculture.<br/><br/>The most significant long-term threat is Avian Malaria (Judge <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The disease&#160;is transmitted by the introduced southern house mosquito&#160;<em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>, and has been detected in the Akohekohe (Feldman <em>et al.&#160;</em>1995). Both the&#160;<em>Culex quinquefasciatus&#160;</em>mosquito and the&#160;<em>Plasmodium relictum</em>&#160;parasite develop more easily at higher temperatures (LaPointe <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), and the resultant prevalence of malaria at lower elevations is thought to explain the species's recent range contraction at lower elevations (Judge <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The species may be particularly vulnerable to mosquito-borne diseases, including avian malaria and avian pox, because it migrates altitudinally in response to varying 'ōhi'a flowering physiology, potentially increasing exposure to mosquitoes at lower elevations (USFWS 2003)<strong></strong>.&#160;Increased temperatures associated with climate change are predicted to increase the prevalence of malaria at higher altitudes in the future (Freed&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). An analysis of the impact of a two degree Celsius temperature rise (as predicted by the end of this century) on the area of malaria-free forest in the Hanawi Forest found that the area where malarial infection is highly probable would increase from 40% to 63% (Benning&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002). A model of the impact of malaria encroachment under climate change on the species's range predicted that the species will lose 92.1% of its range between 1990–2010 and 2080–2100 (Fortini&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>From 1945 to 1995, the spread of feral pigs on Haleakala caused chronic habitat degradation (Loope and Medeiros 1995)<strong></strong> and facilitated the spread of mosquitoes into remote rainforests (Pratt 1994)<strong></strong>. In Hanawi Natural Area Reserve, there was a 473% increase in pig activity, as indexed by ground-cover disturbance, during 1970-1997 (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>, and this reduced alternative food sources to 'ōhi'a bloom (Berlin and VanGelder 1999)<strong></strong>. Predation by introduced rats, cats, Barn Owl (<em>Tyto alba</em>) and possibly small Indian Mongooses (<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>) is a further limiting factor (Berlin and VanGelder 1999,  J. M. Scott <em>in litt.</em> 1999, J. C. Simon <em>in litt.</em> 1999,  E. VanGelder <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>Recently introduced pathogens,&#160;<em>Ceratocystis</em><em>&#160;lukuohia and C. huliohia</em>, both of which cause rapid 'ōhi'a death (R.O.D.), or 'ohi'a&#160;Wilt, have spread rapidly across the Hawaiian islands and caused extensive mortality of 'ōhi'a&#160;(Keith&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), which is an important food and nesting plant for Akohekohe. The effects of R.O.D.&#160;were noticed on Hawai'i&#160;by 2012, the disease was first identified in 2014 (Keith&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and the&#160;<em>Ceratocystis</em>&#160;species involved were confirmed in 2018 (Barnes&#160;<em>et al.</em>).&#160;<em>Ceratocystis&#160;</em>sp. have now spread rapidly across much of the lowland forests on Hawai'i&#160;island, as well as on Kaua'i and&#160;O'ahu, with more than 600 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of forest affected by 2019 (Mortenson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016; Fortini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019; College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources 2020). Surveys of infected forest have found that an average of 25% of 'ōhi'a&#160;trees were dead (Camp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Surveys in an infected area of forest found that the density of another Hawaiian honeycreeper, the Hawaii Amakihi (<em>Chlorodrepanis virens</em>), declined by 79% between 2003-2004 and 2016, following the infection of the forest with R.O.D.&#160;(Camp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;In 2019,&#160;a single 'ōhi'a tree was confirmed to be infected on Maui and was destroyed (College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources 2020).&#160;<em>C. lukuohia</em> appears to<em>&#160;</em>be associated with higher temperatures, and a model of its potential range across Hawaii under current climatic conditions suggested that it may not affect habitat at higher elevations on Maui&#160;where the Akohekohe occurs (Fortini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), but climate change could facilitate its spread into higher elevations where it may impact the Akohekohe.<br/><br/>Climate change may also cause habitat shifts and increase the frequency of extreme weather events that could present further threats to the Akohekohe.","<p></p> <p></p>Surveys in 2017 resulted in a population estimate of 1,768 (95% C.I. 1,193–2,411) individuals (Judge <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).

Nests generally have surrounding vegetation that conceals them from visual contact with conspecifics (Seddon and Davis 1989), but this is not believed to be a prerequisite for successful breeding (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2015). Two eggs are laid from mid-September to mid-October, with hatching occurring at the beginning of November. Chicks fledge from mid-February to mid-March (Seddon <em>et al. </em>2013). Prey species on the mainland are primarily opalfish, sprat, silversides, ahuru, blue cod and arrow squid; red cod used to be an important prey species in the 1980s (van Heezik 1990, Moore and Wakelin 1997, Browne <em>et al.</em> 2011). Blue Cod DNA has been found in 100% of all faecal samples taken from mainland Yellow-eyed Penguins, indicating a significant change in prey quality and type (M. Young <em>et al. </em>unpublished). Yellow-eyed Penguins forage predominantly along the seafloor (87% of all dives) whereas pelagic dives mostly occur when they travel back to their breeding areas (Mattern <em>et al. </em>2007). They occasionally dive deeper than 120 m but predominantly forage in depths of less than 100 m (Seddon <em>et al.</em> 2013). Individuals have preferred foraging sites that they revisit on subsequent foraging trips and even between years (Moore 1999, Mattern <em>et al.</em> 2007). They appear very sensitive to disturbance and degradation of their benthic foraging habitat (Browne <em>et al. </em>2011, Ellenberg and Mattern 2012, Mattern <em>et al.</em> 2013). &#160;<p></p>","<p>By-catch mortality in the commercial gillnet fisheries is thought have driven significant declines over the past two decades, both on predator-free islands, such as Whenua Hou, and along the mainland coast (Ellenberg and Mattern 2012, Mattern <em>et al. </em>2017). Current estimates are 17 (95% CI 6-34) birds caught annually (Ministries for Private Industries, 2019) but this is likely an underestimate and modelling suggests that even these low numbers are sufficient to drive significant population declines (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017). Recreational gillnets are likely to have had an effect on the yellow-eyed penguin population, but are currently banned within coastal waters of up to 4 miles around the South Island (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017), excluding Rakiura, and as such, represent less of a threat. However, if this ban were lifted, this threat would be of similar magnitude to the large-scale gillnets that principally operate further out. Furthermore, fisheries activities appear to affect prey availability and prey quality (Mattern 2007; Browne <em>et al.</em> 2011), and influence penguin foraging behaviour (Mattern<em> et al. </em>2013). Modelling has found a likely correlation between changing sea surface temperature and penguin vital rates, whereby productivity and survival are projected to decline under predicted climate change (Mattern <em>et al.</em> 2017). This has been seen in the Boulder Beach colony, where changes in SST have been found to account for 33% of the population fluctuations (Mattern <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>Introduced ferret <em>Mustela furo</em>, stoat <em>M. erminea</em>, unleashed dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em>, and possibly feral cats <em>Felis catus</em>, are predators in the South Island. Predation by pigs <em>Sus domesticus&#160;</em>on the main Auckland Island and in the Catlins is known to occur (B. McKinlay per D. Houston <em>in litt.</em> 2012). A rogue female New Zealand sea lion <em>Phocarctos hookeri</em> and her daughter had been estimated to eat 20-30 birds annually on the Otago Peninsula (Lalas <em>et al. </em>2007), but they have since died of natural causes. Accidental fires in breeding areas are a known, but infrequent, threat. Repeated adult die-off events remain little understood but might be due to toxins (Gill and Darby 1993). Disease appears to be a growing problem in some populations in most recent years, with diphtheritic stomatitis (caused by the bacteria <em>Corynebacterium</em> spp.) and the blood parasites <em>Plasmodium spp. </em>and&#160;<em>Leucocytozoon tawaki</em>, the latter formerly only known from Fiordland penguins, causes of mortality for chicks (Argilla <em>et al.</em> 2013, Gartrell <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Human disturbance, particularly from unregulated tourists at breeding areas, negatively affects energy budgets, fledgling weight and probability of survival (McClung <em>et al.</em> 2004; Ellenberg <em>et al. </em>2007, 2009, 2013), with human to penguin distance being a predictor of the likelihood of defensive behaviour (French <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;</p><p></p><p></p>","Past estimates suggested there were around 1,700 breeding pairs (3,400 breeders), with an estimated 60% of these in the sub-Antarctic (Auckland Campbell Islands) (Seddon<em> et al.</em> 2013), but recent declines on mainland New Zealand indicate the total population is lower that previously thought.&#160;Surveys in the Auckland Islands in 2017 estimated 577 pairs (Muller&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2020). The Campbell Island population was last estimated in 1992 at 350-540 pairs (Moore 2001). Stewart Island and outliers were estimated at 220-400 pairs in 1994, dropping to 178 pairs in 1999-2001 (Massaro and Blair 2003). In 2011-2012 South Island's south-east coast was thought to hold 452 pairs (Seddon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013), in 2015, there were 252 breeding pairs counted on the South Island, while in 2019, the total number of breeding pairs counted in the South Island was 227 (DOC;&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>). Based on these most recent estimates, the global population is estimated to be in the range of 2,684 - 3,064 mature individuals, rounded here to 2,600 - 3,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>There is very little movement between the mainland and sub-Antarctic and genetic analyses reveal two distinct sub-populations (mainland New Zealand including Stewart Island, and the sub-Antarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands; Boessenkool <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/><p></p> <p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Megadyptes antipodes </em>is endemic to New Zealand where it breeds on the South Island's south-east coast (452 pairs in 2011-/12 [Seddon <em>et al. </em>2013], 225 pairs 2018/19 [DOC <em>unpublished data</em>, 2020]), Stewart Island and outliers (178 pairs in 1999-2001 [Massaro and Blair 2003]), the Auckland Islands group (520-570 pairs in 1989 [Moore 1992] and 577 pairs in 2017 [Muller <em>et al</em>., 2020]) and Campbell Island (350-540 pairs in 1992&#160; [Moore 2001, Seddon <em>et al.</em> 2013]). The South Island population is genetically distinct from the two sub-Antarctic populations (inferred immigration rate 0.003 per generation; Boessenkool <em>et al.</em> 2010). Adults are sedentary and generally forage within 50 km of their breeding colonies (Mattern <em>et al. </em>2007), but juveniles may disperse north as far as the Cook Strait (Marchant and Higgins 1990).<p></p>","Breeding colonies are a tourist attraction in their own right, and the value of nature-based tourism with Yellow-eyed Penguin was estimated at NZ $100 million in 2007 to the Dunedin economy (Tisdell 2007).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Conservation management projects are and have been undertaken in the South Island by or under New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) approvals.

While some colonies appear to have stabilised, mass-mortality events believed to be connected to water temperature mediated food availability are occurring too frequently for populations to recover, and as such the population is suspected to continue to decline at a rapid rate. As such, the species has been assessed as Vulnerable.   <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>This species returns to its breeding colonies in October, which range from sea-level sites to cliff-tops, and sometimes inland. Clutch size is two eggs, laid and incubated during November and December for 32-34 days. Chicks fledge and depart the colony in February (BirdLife International 2010). At most breeding sites, only one chick fledges, but there is some evidence that it is not unusual for Southern Rockhopper Penguins in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) to raise two chicks (Clausen and Pütz 2002, Poisbleau <em>et al.</em> 2008). Pairs successfully fledging two chicks has also been observed on Crozet (C. A. Bost <em>pers. comm.</em>).<br/><br/>Southern Rockhopper Penguins prey on a variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods,&#160;with components varying in importance spatially and temporally (Williams 1995, Pütz <em>et al.</em> 2013). There is also individual dietary specialization during part of their annual cycle (Dehnhard <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>At the Falklands (Malvinas), hybridization occurs with Macaroni (White and Clausen 2002) and Northern Rockhopper Penguins (Crofts and Robson 2016).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>Climate change appears to be a significant factor in driving declines. Survival of adult Southern Rockhopper Penguins appears to be sensitive to ocean temperatures, with highest survival probabilities under moderately-cold to long-term average temperature, and reduced survival probabilities under increasingly cold or warm ocean temperatures (Raya Rey <em>et al.</em> 2007, Dehnhard <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Southern Rockhopper Penguins in the Falklands (Malvinas) delayed breeding under warmer environmental conditions and laid lighter eggs, with potential impacts on breeding success (Dehnhard <em>et al.</em> 2015a, b). Temperature extremes have caused collapse in accessible food resources in the past, and these are part of an ongoing trend in more frequent unusual oceanographic conditions recurring in the area (Dehnhard <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Penguins and their habitats may also be threatened by increased frequency of storm events at breeding sites (Wolfaardt <em>et al.</em> 2012). Severe mortality was recorded in moulting birds found unusually far from colonies in 2016, which appeared to be related to a set of poorly understood oceanographic conditions, leading to lowered primary productivity near to breeding sites immediately prior to moult (Morgenthaler <em>et al. </em>2018). Wind-patterns are also subject to change under global warming scenarios and have been shown to affect the foraging success of rockhopper penguins; the currently dominating southerly and westerly winds increased foraging success while foraging success was lower under northerly and easterly wind directions, which may become more frequent in the future (Dehnhard<em> et al. </em>2013b).<br/><br/>Besides these apparent bottom-up effects, climate change may also lead to top-down changes in food web structure, causing increased inter-specific competition and secondary predation, e.g. competition and predation by the rapidly increasing pinniped (fur seal and sea lion) populations (Barlow <em>et al. </em>2002, Raya Rey <em>et al.</em> 2012, Morrison <em>et al.</em> 2017). Overwintering conditions are thought to influence the proportions of birds skipping breeding at Marion Island (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2006) and potentially elsewhere. Predation by native eared seal species&#160;impacts, for example, the populations on Marion and Campbell Islands, where modelling indicates that it is an important driver of the very rapid declines in the local population. Yet, the impacts of occasional years of poor food availability appear to exert a larger impact on the species' demographic rates than do predation regimes (Morrison <em>et al. </em>2017). Overwintering conditions are thought to influence the proportions of birds skipping breeding at Marion Island (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2006) and potentially elsewhere. The number of Southern Rockhopper Penguins returning to Marion Island to breed decreased by about 20% between 1994/95 and 2007/08 and was significantly correlated with breeding success (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2008).<br/><br/>The number of Southern Rockhopper Penguins affected by oil pollution is currently not thought to be as great as in the past, when 40,000 Magellanic Penguins <em>Spheniscus magellanicus</em> were estimated to be contaminated annually in Argentina (Gandini <em>et al.</em> 1994). In Patagonian coastal waters, hydrocarbon exploitation still poses a threat (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1998), as does the potential development of hydrocarbons at the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (between 2008 and 2019, fewer than a hundred oiled individuals were reported in the Falklands (Malvinas), with the highest occurrence in September and October; S. Crofts pers. comm.<em>)</em>. Rockhopper penguins on Staten Island have elevated mercury levels, despite foraging at a lower trophic level when compared to conspecifics from other breeding sites (Brasso <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>At some sites, introduced grazing animals have caused significant vegetation loss. In the past, overgrazing by rabbits led to serious erosion and landslips on Macquarie Island; however, vegetation is now recovering following the successful Macquarie Island Pest Eradication Project (Parks and Wildlife Service 2014). The impact of grazing goats and deer at Isla de los Estados is not known and should be investigated. It is thought that introduced pigs on the Auckland Islands continue to negatively impact local penguin populations, and eradication efforts have been suggested (BirdLife International 2010). Cats and rats are present in parts of the species’ range, but have not been found to cause significant mortality (BirdLife International 2010).<br/><br/>There are very few records of disease outbreaks, although a few colonies are visited regularly. Avian cholera caused the deaths of a small number of adults and chicks at Campbell Island in 1985/86 (de Lisle <em>et al.</em> 1990). Avian Pox has been reported within the Falkland (Malvinas) population, but in a small number of individuals at few sites only (e.g. New Island in 2014, P. Quillfeldt unpubl.). An unknown disease caused up to a hundred adult mortalities at Steeple Jason (Crofts 2014). The massive mortality event on the Falklands (Malvinas) in 2002/03 was due to a Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB), causing mortality via paralytic shellfish poisoning (Uhart<em> et al. </em>2007). Impacts were region-wide, and affected populations took several years to recover (Crofts 2014).&#160; At the Falklands (Malvinas) and in southern Patagonia, adult mortalities of an unknown extent were reported during the moulting period following the breeding season 2015/16 (Crofts and Stanworth 2016, 2017, A. Raya Rey <em>pers. comm.</em>).</p><p>Egg collection was common at some colonies until the 1950s, such as in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), but is now prohibited. Historically, penguins were taken as bait for use in crab pots at a number of sites, including some Chilean islands (Ryan and Cooper 1991, P. G. Ryan <em>in litt.</em> 1999). The disappearance of the colony on Isla Recalada in Chile indicates that human depredation, in this case the collection of zoological specimens and as bait for crab pots (Oehler <em>et al. </em>2007), is still a serious threat to colonies where sites are accessible and not well protected. Although the number of birds taken in recent years from other Chilean colonies is less than 500 individuals per year (BirdLife International 2010), the potential remains to drive slow declines in parts of the species's range.<br/><br/>Another potential threat stems from interaction with fisheries; levels of bycatch mortality appear to be insignificant, but resource competition and indirect changes to the food web through modification of ecosystems may have more extensive impacts (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2017). Land-based human threats at breeding sites, such as tourism, research and land management, are considered low, and although it may vary on local scales, disturbance from such activities is currently deemed not significant at an overall population level at the Falklands (Malvinas) (Crofts 2014). Tourism is strictly regulated with visits only to a small percentage of the global population.</p><p></p>","Latest counts on islands off South America revealed a total of ca. 850,000 breeding pairs of subspecies&#160;<em>E.c. chrysocome</em>&#160;(Falkland Islands: 319,163 breeding pairs in 2010, Isla de los Estados: 135,000 pairs in 2010, Isla Pinguino: 1,061 pairs in 2014, Isla Ildefonso: 86,400 pairs in 2006, Diego Ramirez: 132,721 pairs in 2002, Isla Noir: 158,200 pairs in 2005, Isla Barnevelt: 10,800 pairs in 1992, Cape Horn: 600 pairs in 1992, Isla Terhalten: 3,000 pairs in 2008 and Isla Buenaventura: 500 pairs in 1992 [Schiavini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, BirdLife International 2010, Raya Rey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014,&#160;Gandini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Baylis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013]).&#160;<br/><br/>The subspecies&#160;<em>E. c. filholi</em>&#160;totals 422,000 breeding pairs; Prince Edward Islands: 38,000 pairs in 2008/09 (Crawford&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009); Marion Island: 58,955 pairs in 2018/19 (Makhado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;unpubl.); Crozet Islands: 152,800 pairs in 1982; Kerguelen Islands (French Southern Territories): 85,500 pairs in 1985; Heard Island (Heard and McDonald Islands [to Australia]): 10,000 pairs in 2003; Macquarie Island (Australia): 37,500 pairs in 2007; Campbell (New Zealand): 33,239 pairs in 2012 (Morrison<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2015); Auckland (New Zealand): 3,000 pairs in 1990 and Antipodes Islands (New Zealand): 2,700-3,600 pairs in 1990.<p></p>  <p></p>There is evidence that there are at least three subpopulations, two within <em>E. c</em>. <em>chrysocome </em>(Lois <em>et al. </em>2020) and <em>E. c. filholi</em>&#160;separate from these (Mays&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).

The foraging ranges of Northern Rockhopper Penguins have been investigated for penguins breeding on Nightingale and Gough islands in the Atlantic Ocean (Steinfurth&#160;<em>et al. </em>in revision) and for penguins breeding on Amsterdam Island (Thiebot&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Heerah <em>et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/><em>South Atlantic Ocean<br/></em><br/>Northern Rockhopper Penguins display marked variability in their spatial distribution during different stages of the breeding season and between islands but show high fidelity in the use of foraging areas between years. Duration of trips is shortest for brood-guard trips (74 hours max. duration) and longest for incubation trips (839 hours). Incubation trips are on average six days longer for males than for females, and five days shorter for males from Nightingale than from Gough. During the crèche stage both sexes perform two distinct trip types with short trips lasting generally just one day and long trips lasting up to three weeks.</p><p><br/>During incubation, penguins breeding on Nightingale Island disperse mostly east-west, remain mainly within the boundaries of the Tristan da Cunha EEZ (mean maximum range: 402 and 277 km for males and females, respectively) and stay north of the Subtropical Front, while penguins breeding on Gough Island have a greater foraging range (584 and 337 km, respectively) and show strong directionality with high continuity, travelling south and south-east towards the Subantarctic Front. During chick-rearing Northern Rockhoppers generally remain within 80 km of their colony (Steinfurth <em>et al.</em> in revision).</p><p>Outside the breeding season preliminary analysis of GLS tracking data from Nightingale and Gough islands reveal that birds disperse over an area stretching to the east along the Walvis Ridge and to the region of the Southern African shelf (approx. 21°S and 15°E) towards the South American continent (approx. 42°W) and south into the region of the Polar Front (approx. 51°S).&#160;<br/><br/><em>South Indian Ocean</em><br/><br/></p><p>Amsterdam Island penguins&#160;&#160;</p><p>Individuals make looping trips during the incubation period, with a mean foraging range of 230 km, but some birds may forage as far as 410 km away from their colony. Birds mostly targeted areas around and north-east of the colony. By contrast, brooding birds usually forage much closer to the colony (8-80 km). The core areas are essentially west and south-east of the colony (Heerah <em>et al.</em> 2019). During chick rearing,&#160; while Northern Rockhopper Penguins mainly stay within the French EEZ to forage within small areas east or north-west of the colony, some birds may forage up to 600 km south of Amsterdam Island during the creche stage. Long trips to the south, toward the Subtropical Front, are likely undertaken by failed breeders, when no chicks survive in the colony (C-A Bost, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>After moulting, GLS data indicate that Amsterdam penguins perform long-range movements of up to 2200 km away from the colony, mainly in longitudinal direction, as far as the south-western side of Australia, without any return to land. Most birds head south-east, along the Indian Ridge and forage south of the Subtropical Front using deep waters (3,000-3,500 m) with very heterogeneous sea surface temperature anomalies and chlorophyll concentrations (Thiebot <em>et al.</em> 2012). Oceanic fronts appear to be an important habitat feature as for many top-predators of the Southern Ocean (Bost <em>et al. </em>2009).<br/><br/><strong>Breeding and moulting biology</strong><br/></p><p>Adults arrive at the breeding colonies in late July (males) and August (females). At the Atlantic breeding sites, nests are located in a variety of habitats ranging from open boulder-strewn beaches on Gough Island and Tristan da Cunha to among dense stands of tall tussock grass (mainly <em>Spartina arundinacea</em>) on Nightingale, Alex (Middle) and Inaccessible islands (Cuthbert 2013). In the Indian Ocean, on Amsterdam and St Paul islands, penguins breed in steep or gently sloping ground in a variety of habitats from sea-level up to 170 m above sea-level. Habitats vary from open boulder-strewn beaches to among stands of tussock grass (<em>Spartina arundinacea</em> and <em>Poa novarae</em>).<br/><br/>Two eggs are laid in early September, the earlier ‘A’ egg being smaller than the later ‘B’ egg as for other <em>Eudyptes</em> penguins. Incubation is divided into two shifts: males make the first trip of three weeks’ duration and females the second lasting two weeks. Chicks hatch in October but only one chick is raised, usually from the B egg. Male birds guard the nest during the 2-3 week while females perform short-range daily foraging trips to feed the chick. Chicks then enter the crèche stage (when both parents forage simultaneously and leave the chick unguarded) until they fledge in December in the northern archipelago or January on Gough. For Northern Rockhopper Penguins breeding on Gough Island and hence south of the Subtropical Front, the penguin’s breeding cycle begins about 3-4 weeks later than in the northern islands. The breeding phenology on Amsterdam-St Paul islands in the South Indian Ocean is similar to that of the northern Atlantic sites.<br/><br/>After the chicks have fledged the parents undertake a pre-moult trip and return ashore between mid-January and late February to moult. The annual moult is completed in about three weeks after which the birds depart onto their winter migration, only returning to shore for the following breeding season.<br/><br/><strong>Prey</strong><br/><br/>Northern Rockhopper Penguins are opportunistic foragers, utilizing different areas during the breeding and non-breeding season. On Tristan da Cunha, they mainly feed on crustaceans, mainly krill (euphausiids) supplemented with small proportions of fish and cephalopods (Booth and McQuaid 2013, Cuthbert 2013). Juvenile squid and crustaceans were the main prey by mass at Amsterdam Island (Tremblay and Cherel 2003). Dietary studies from Tristan da Cunha and Amsterdam Island reveal seasonal changes in diets: crustaceans (Tristan da Cunha) and cephalopods (Amsterdam) dominated the diet during the early chick-crèche stage but fish became the main prey item at both islands in the later stages of chick rearing (Tremblay <em>et al. </em>1997, Booth and McQuaid 2013, Booth<em> et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/><strong>Predation</strong><br/><br/>During the breeding season, in the Tristan group and on Amsterdam Island, adult and immature Northern Rockhopper Penguins are regularly preyed upon by Northern (Amsterdam Is.) and Southern Giant Petrels <em>Macronectes halli&#160;</em>and <em>M. giganteus</em> on the shore and at sea (Ryan <em>et al.</em> 2008, A. Steinfurth, pers. obs., C-A. Bost, pers. obs), while in the colony, unprotected eggs and chicks are taken by the Subantarctic Skua <em>Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi</em> and Tristan Thrush <em>Turdus eremita</em> (A. Steinfurth, pers. obs.). In 2019, for the first time, predation by a subantarctic fur seal <em>Arctocephalus tropicalis</em> was observed off Nightingale Island (T. Glass, pers. obs.). On Amsterdam Island, active predation by Subantarctic Skuas also occurs during the breeding season. Predation on adults by seals close to the shore is reported but is believed to be rare. Predation by Subantarctic Fur Seals, Giant Petrels and Skuas is thought to influence population trends of <em>Eudyptes </em>populations elsewhere (Horswill <em>et al. </em>2014, Morrisson <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>The causes of current population declines are poorly understood, but introduced species (including pathogens), increasing competition for habitat and food with a rapidly growing Subantarctic Fur Seal <em>Arctocephalus tropicalis</em> population, changes in sea surface temperature and/or marine productivity, human-induced activities and pollution, are all likely to be implicated to some degree.<br/><br/><strong>Human exploitation</strong><br/><br/>Historically, vast numbers of birds and products from penguins were collected (i.e. eggs were harvested, oil extracted from moulting birds, feathers collected for stuffing pillows and mattresses, and feathers being used for making ornamental table mats on Tristan; eggs and adults on St. Paul Island used by sealers). These practices were largely discontinued by 1955 (Hagen 1952, Wace &amp; Holdgate 1976, Richardson 1984); the egg harvest was suspended in 2011 (following the MS Oliva oil spill) but as of 2018 has been reopened. To date, penguin guano is harvested from Nightingale and Alex islands after the breeding season by the Tristan community to provide fertilizer for their allotments.<br/><br/><strong>Fisheries&#160;<br/><br/></strong>Penguins have been taken as bait for use in crab pots at a number of sites, including at St Paul (Indian Ocean) and Tristan da Cunha (Atlantic Ocean) (Guinard <em>et al.</em> 1998, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2009), and driftnet fishing and rock-lobster fisheries may have caused significant mortality in the past (Ryan &amp; Cooper 1991, Crawford <em>et al. </em>2017, TAFF 2011). With only few records of fisheries-related mortality (Ryan and Cooper 1991) and no legal gillnet fishery, bycatch does not appear to be a major threat to the species now. However, recent evidence of illegal use of gillnets within the species' foraging range indicates that unobserved bycatch may be higher than suspected (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017). Still, it is considered unlikely to affect more than a minority of the overall population (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2009, Cuthbert 2013, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Food availability&#160;</strong><br/><br/>Food availability may have been compromised by climate change (through increased sea surface temperature [SST]), an increase in Subantarctic fur seal populations and shifts in marine food webs (Cunningham &amp; Moors 1994, Guinard<em> et al. </em>1998, Barlow<em> et al. </em>2002, Hilton<em> et al.</em> 2006, Cuthbert 2013). Population declines have occurred over relatively large spatio-temporal scales, possibly implying that at the ecosystem-scale, at-sea factors are likely to be involved (Hilton <em>et al. </em>2006). Population numbers have been found to correlate with SST on Amsterdam Island (Guinard<em> et al.</em> 1998), while Hilton et al. (2006) found some evidence for a link between decreased primary productivity and population declines and a shift to lower trophic levels due to warming SST. However, different sites showed divergent trends, and the impacts of climate change remain inconclusive. In addition, adult body condition at the beginning of the breeding and moulting periods has been stable since the mid 1990’s (Delord <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/><strong>Oil Pollution<br/><br/></strong>On 16 March 2011, the cargo ship MS Oliva ran aground on Nightingale Island, spilling 1500 tons of fuel and heavy crude oil. This impacted Nightingale, Middle/Alex and Inaccessible islands; breeding sites to almost half of the world’s Northern Rockhopper Penguin population (Tristan main island was unaffected by the spill). Thousands of oiled penguins were caught on Nightingale and transported to Tristan da Cunha where they were cleaned and rehabilitated by a project involving virtually all the island’s inhabitants. Only a few hundreds were saved, and it is impossible to say how many died in the wild. Moreover, the long-term effects of the oil spill on the populations are still unknown. The increase in volume of passing shipping poses a growing risk of chronic oiling and/or further catastrophic spills. <br/>For the Atlantic Ocean population, oil pollution is currently considered the main threat.<br/><br/><strong>Plastics<br/><br/></strong>So far, no impact of plastics pollution on Northern Rockhoppers has been reported from any of their colonies. However, in an ecosystem assessment at the islands carried out in 2017, microplastics were found in 15 of the 19 samples taken (Caselle <em>et al.</em> 2017). Whilst this is a small sample, it indicates the potential necessity for further investigation of the impacts of microplastics.<br/><br/><strong>Invasive species, disease and parasites&#160;<br/><br/></strong>Among birds, penguins are particularly prone to infection by pathogens (Grimaldi <em>et al.</em> 2015). The pathogen <em>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</em>, the causative agent of erysipelas, has been recently detected in Northern Rockhopper Penguins breeding on Amsterdam Island (Jaeger <em>et al. </em>2018). Another identified pathogen <em>Pasteurella multocida </em>(avian cholera) has been implicated in the high chick mortality of Indian Yellow-Nosed Albatrosses <em>Thalassarche carteri </em>on Amsterdam Island. These pathogens could be responsible for four successive years of complete breeding failure of the Northern Rockhopper Penguin population there, although further studies are needed to confirm whether this is the case. The only study of serology and infections on Northern Rockhopper Penguins in the Tristan group was confined to avian influenza on Gough island (Abad <em>et al. </em>2013). In this study, 5% of birds sampled tested positive for antibodies and none for active infection. The impacts on survival are unknown (few birds with antibodies could indicate that infected birds usually die, rather than infection rates being low). In the breeding season 2010/2011, Booth (2011) carried out a study on parasitism in breeding Northern Rockhopper Penguins at the Stony Beach colony on Tristan da Cunha. The protozoan <em>Babesia </em>was the only parasite observed in the samples. Sixty-one percent of all birds examined presented with<em> Babesia </em>infestation (likely <em>B. peircei</em>).&#160;</p><p>Introduced house mice <em>Mus musculus</em> on Gough Island are known predators of seabirds but have not yet been recorded preying on penguins. The same applies to introduced rats <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> on Amsterdam Island and <em>R. rattus</em> on Tristan da Cunha. The only reported cases of major predation by invasive species are by feral pigs on Tristan da Cunha and Inaccessible islands (where they were eradicated in 1873 and 1930, respectively). Domestic and feral dogs were also reported to kill penguins on Tristan da Cunha (BirdLife International 2010) but this threat is now controlled. Feral cattle used to occur on Amsterdam Island, but all were removed c. 5 years ago. On Tristan da Cunha cattle still exists and in close proximity to some of the penguin rockeries. Grazing of cattle has altered the extent and/or structure of the original habitat which may have had some indirect effect on the habitat. Direct impact by predation of rats, cats and mice on eggs, chicks or adults has never been reported in Amsterdam Island but are all possible. Rats may act as a reservoir for maintaining bacteria between two breeding seasons while seabirds are absent from the island (Jaeger <em>et al. </em>2018). Studies on Amsterdam and Gough islands to investigate the role of rats and mice in bacterial maintenance and transmission in the seabird community are currently being conducted.<br/><br/><strong>Tourism<br/><br/></strong>Tourism is not considered a threat at the current low volumes, but the number of cruise ships and tourists can be expected to increase, so the current regulations need to be kept under review. <br/><br/><strong>Hybridization<br/><br/></strong>In 2014, for the first time a breeding attempt between a Northern and a Southern Rockhopper Penguin was recorded on the Falklands Islands. A hybrid chick hatched but died before fledging. A negative impact of hybridization on the population is unlikely to be significant, in contrary, hybridisation could become important in <em>Eudyptes</em> penguins adapting to future climate change scenarios.</p><p></p>","The latest estimates suggest a total population of <em>c. </em>206,850 breeding pairs with the majority of the population (89.7%) being found at the Atlantic Ocean breeding sites (62,791 pairs on Middle/Alex Island in 2016, 64,700 pairs on Gough Island in 2006, 20,423 pairs on Nightingale Island in 2017, 33,867 pairs on Inaccessible Island in&#160; 2016, 3584 pairs on Tristan da Cunha islands in 2015) and 10.3% at the Indian Ocean islands (12,161 pairs on Amsterdam Island in 2015, 7,580 pairs on St Paul Island in 2018) (RZSS, BAS, CEBC-CNRS, RSPB, TAAF, TCD 2018).<br/><br/>Overall, recent analysis of population trends indicates that over the previous 30 years (three generations) the number of Northern Rockhopper Penguins globally declined by 57% (RZSS, BAS, CEBC-CNRS, RSPB, TAAF, TCD 2018).<br/><br/>Early records indicate that millions of Northern Rockhopper Penguins used to occur on both Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island prior to 1955. As a very rough estimate, approximately 2 million pairs (98%) were lost from Gough Island between 1955 and 2006, and Tristan da Cunha is thought to have held hundreds of thousands of pairs in the 1870s, which were reduced to around 5,000 pairs by 1955 (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2009). At Amsterdam Island, numbers have been declining at an average rate of 3.7% since the early 1970s resulting in a 80% decline over the past three generations (Barbraud <em>et al. </em>in revision). On Saint Paul Island, the population has increased at a rate of 1.4% since the early 1970s (Barbraud <em>et al. </em>in revision).",Decreasing,"<em></em><p>The Northern Rockhopper Penguin is found in the temperate South Atlantic and Indian oceans, breeding on seven islands between 37–40° S. Approximately 90% of the global population is found in the Atlantic Ocean, breeding at the Tristan da Cunha archipelago and Gough Island<strong> </strong>(<strong>Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha UK Overseas Territories</strong>) and the remaining 10% in the Indian Ocean on <strong>Amsterdam and St Paul islands</strong> (French Southern Territories) (Cuthbert 2013). The location of these islands places the breeding distribution of most Northern Rockhopper Penguins north of the Subtropical Front, with the exception of Gough Island, which lies between the Subtropical Front and the Subantarctic Front to the south. <br/></p><p>During the incubation period, penguins forage more than 800 km and 670 km away from their breeding site on Nightingale and Gough Island, respectively, whereas during brooding foraging ranges are restricted to a maximum distance of 35 km (Nightingale Island) and 24 km (Gough Island) (Steinfurth <em>et al. unpubl. data</em>). Tracking data from Nightingale and Gough islands further reveal that birds disperse after moult over an area stretching to the east along the Walvis Ridge and to the region of the Southern African shelf (approx. 21°S and 15°E) towards the South American continent (approx. 42°W) and south into the region of the Antarctic convergence (approx. 51°S). While penguins breeding on Nightingale Island display high variability in foraging locations during incubation and over-winter migration, penguins breeding on Gough Island show strong directionality with high continuity, travelling south and south-east. Penguins breeding on Amsterdam Island perform looping trips during the incubation, with a mean foraging range of 230 km, but some breeders may forage as far as 410 km off their colony. Brooding birds usually forage much closer to the colony, staying within the region of the shelf (range 8-80 km) (Bost <em>unpubl. data</em>). After moulting, penguins from Amsterdam Island perform long-range movements of up to 2200 km away from the colony, mainly in longitudinal direction without any return to land. The majority of birds head south-east, along the Indian Ridge and forage south of the southern boundary of the subtropical front, using deep waters (3000-3500 m) with very heterogeneous sea surface temperature anomalies and chlorophyll concentrations (Thiebot <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160; </p>  <p>Vagrants have been recorded from South Africa (Rollinson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and the Falkland Islands (Matias <em>et al. </em>2009, Crofts and Robson 2015). The first breeding attempt of a Northern with a Southern Rockhopper Penguin, <em>Eudyptes chrysocome</em>, was recorded in 2014 on East Falkland (Crofts and Robson 2015).&#160;</p><p></p>","The species is a tourist attraction in its own right, bringing international wildlife tourists to remote islands.

All research has to fulfil Tristan da Cunha conservation priorities and be approved by the Conservation Department and is subject to ethical clearance. Scientists are required to complete a permit application and protocol for researchers and must abide by the Tristan da Cunha Environmental Charter. The Tristan da Cunha Environment Charter outlines the environmental management commitments of the UK Government and the Government of Tristan da Cunha and serves as a framework policy to guide the development of management policies and plans. The Tristan da Cunha Fisheries Limits Ordinance 1983 controls commercial fishing activity within the Tristan da Cunha Exclusive Economic Zone covering 200 nautical miles offshore from the islands. Gough and Inaccessible Islands are managed as a World Heritage Site, Wildlife Reserve, IUCN Protected Area category 1, with research and weather monitoring the only activities permitted: each is surrounded by protected marine areas extending 12 nautical miles from their shorelines.<br/><br/>To avoid unregulated disturbance and introduction of invasive species into penguin colonies, tourists are permitted to go ashore at Nightingale and Inaccessible for guided wildlife tours, only if accompanied by a Tristanian appointed by the Conservation Department team and only on daytime visits. No tourism is permitted at Gough Island. As part of the Gough and Inaccessible Islands World Heritage Site Management Plan (2015-2020), “Guidelines for Day Visitors to Inaccessible Island” are provided to visiting tourists. All visitors to the outer islands and Tristan have to complete a “Biosecurity Self-Audit Checklist and Declaration”.<br/><br/>Amsterdam and St Paul islands are part of the Réserve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Françaises, administered by the TAAF (French Southern and Antarctic Territories), which incorporates a protected marine zone covering more than 672,000 km2. The St Paul colony is within in a strictly protected area. Amsterdam colonies are included in a scientific dedicated area with a restricted access. Here, protective measures are implemented on landing and moving around the island to minimise the risk of spreading pathogens. The seabirds of Amsterdam and St Paul islands are protected by law. The French Administration and her/his leader (Préfet) are assisted in management of the reserve by a scientific council comprising members of the Polar Environment Committee and a management committee. <br/><br/>Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands are included in the National Nature Reserve of the French Southern and Antarctic Territories (TAAF) created in 2006, including the entire surface of these islands as well as Crozet, Kerguelen, and a large portion of their surrounding waters. French Southern and Antarctic Territories carry out active environmental policies linked to the conversation of the biodiversity. <br/><br/><em>International designations<br/><br/></em>Gough and Inaccessible islands have been gazetted as an UNESCO World Heritage Site, as two of the least disturbed cool-temperate island ecosystems in the South Atlantic Ocean with international importance for colonies of seabirds, and several endemic species and subspecies of land birds. BirdLife International has designated the Tristan Endemic Bird Area (including Inaccessible Island) and Gough Island Endemic Bird Area. <br/><br/>The whole TAAF Réserve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Françaises is a Ramsar site. Gough and Inaccessible islands are also Ramsar sites and the Northern Rockhopper Penguin is among the species cited in the designations. Gough Island, and the Plateau des Tourbières on Amsterdam island are both listed as Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites, for endemic bird species (not penguins). Although some of these designations target primarily other species, they highlight the rich biodiversity value of the two island groups, and they attract support and funding from governments and international organisations, including for the waters around the islands, foraging and dispersal sites of Northern Rockhopper Penguins.<br/><br/><em>Conservation &amp; research projects<br/><br/></em>Northern Rockhopper Penguin numbers are monitored regularly on Amsterdam and St Paul islands (CEBC-CNRS), Gough, Nightingale and Middle/Alex islands and at all sites on Tristan da Cunha by the Tristan Conservation Department. Counts on Inaccessible Island are intermittent. On Nightingale Island, a deep rock crevice that was trapping and killing penguins was covered (Cuthbert 2013). The year after the oil spill, in 2012, a comprehensive penguin research programme was initiated in the islands to investigate aspects of the penguins’ ecology at vital breeding sites to help understand the potential impact of any natural and/or anthropogenic threats to this population and to inform conservation actions (e.g. Johaadien 2013, Steinfurth <em>et al.</em> in review). Survival rates are an important driver of population trends; a long-term demographic study was implemented on Nightingale Island in 2016 to understand the causes of current decline.<br/><br/>An assessment of sustainable egg harvest levels has been produced (Ratcliffe 2018) to give advice to the Tristan da Cunha Island Council on a sustainable harvest protocol (submitted to the Tristan Council in 2018).<br/><br/>In 2016, as part of its obligations to meet Aichi Target 11, the UK government initiated its Blue Belt Programme, which aims to designate Marine Protected Areas that encompass a total of four million km2 of sea within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of its 14 Overseas Territories, including Tristan da Cunha. To support this initiative, tracking data from three important colonies of Northern Rockhopper Penguins were used to provide information on the species’ spatial distribution to ensure that the most biologically valuable areas are recognized for protection.&#160; <br/><br/>Recent projects at breeding sites in the South Atlantic and South Indian oceans aimed at determining key marine habitats of the Northern Rockhopper Penguin with the main objectives of this project to characterize habitats during the breeding season, create habitat models to predict changes in the locations of habitats under various climate change scenarios and delimit marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (mIBAs) as a tool to help protect key foraging areas.<br/><br/>Following recommendations given in the recently published Northern Rockhopper Species Action Plan (RZSS, BAS, CEBC-CNRS, RSPB, TAAF, TCD 2018) investigations are underway to understand the genetic connectivity between island subpopulations across the species’ global breeding sites with emphasis on potential disease transfer.&#160;<br/><br/><em>Strategic framework&#160;<br/><br/></em>The UK Overseas Territories Biodiversity Strategy (DEFRA 2009) is a framework document covering conservation in all UK Overseas Territories and contains five strategic priorities (three are broadly relevant to Northern Rockhopper Penguins). The Tristan da Cunha Biodiversity Action Plan 2012-2016 (Tristan da Cunha Government and RSPB 2012) is currently undergoing revision. Management plans for Gough and Inaccessible islands were produced in 1994 and 2001, respectively; they were followed by a revised management plan for the Gough and Inaccessible islands World Heritage Site covering 2015-2020 (Tristan Conservation Department and RSPB 2012). Concerning the Indian Ocean population, a first management plan (2011-2015) has been produced for the Réserve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Françaises (TAAF 2010). In 2017, a new management plan covering 2018-2027 has been approved. This plan includes actions related to the impact of human activities, improvement of knowledge on species and habitats, restoration of species both on land and at sea within the natural reserve. A national action plan for the preservation of the Amsterdam albatross was produced in 2011 (TAAF 2011) and is currently in revision. It includes actions regarding the impact of disease and introduced mammals on the Amsterdam albatross and other seabirds, including the Northern Rockhopper Penguin.<br/><br/>An International Species Action Plan was developed at a workshop held at and hosted by the RZSS in Edinburgh, Scotland in October 2017 to identify the most important threats to this species and to recommend conservation actions until 2027 (RZSS, BAS, CEBC-CNRS, RSPB, TAAF, TCD 2018). <br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong></p><p>Following recommendations of the Northern Rockhopper Action Plan (2018), general actions are to; continue or start to monitor all populations in order to assess trends and improve methodologies for monitoring; conduct long-term demographic studies to understand the causes of the current decline; determine genetic connectivity between island subpopulations across the species’s global breeding sites with emphasis on potential disease transfer; conduct research into spatial and temporal links between population trends, sea-surface temperature and primary productivity; investigate the possible impact of oil exploitation; conduct studies to assess interactions with commercial fisheries; assess the threat from introduced predators; reduce disturbance from ecotourism through the use of codes of conduct; assess the threats of disease and increase biosecurity measures.</p><p>For Tristan da Cunha, bring the International Maritime Organisation to designate waters within 50 nautical miles of the coast as ‘Areas To Be Avoided’ so that shipping is routed away from vulnerable, nearshore aggregations of penguins. <br/><br/>For Amsterdam-St Paul islands, to regulate fishing activity within the islands’ EEZ by the French administration and only one commercial vessel can set demersal vertical longlines between November and April within the EEZ.

195863093,39255,Rupicapra rupicapra,Least Concern,,2021,2020-07-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Northern Chamois&#160;is widespread as a species and has a large population of just under 500,000 individuals (Corlatti <em>et al</em>. in press). Although it is declining in some parts of its distribution range, the bulk of the population (subspecies <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>) is found in the Alps and is currently secure. Consequently, it is assessed as Least Concern. However, most chamois subspecies qualify as threatened, and require urgent conservation action.</p>    <em>R. r. asiatica</em> – Recent data suggest that the subspecies has experienced catastrophic declines in population size in the last several decades due to intensive human impact. The overall population is less than 2,500 mature individuals (estimated between 500 and 750 individuals). There is an observed and projected decline by more than 20% in two generations based on recent, ongoing and planned development projects (roads and hydro-power plants in montane areas) affecting habitat and connectivity, and causing an increase in pressure by illegal hunting. Therefore, the subspecies <em>asiatica</em> should be listed as Endangered (EN) C1+2a(i).  <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> - Listed as Vulnerable (VU) D1+2. Confined to a single mountain, the population size was estimated at 1,500 individuals in 2017-2018 (Prévost 2018). Assuming that ca. 60% of the population are mature (IUCN definition), this would translate into a total of 900 adults. The past introduction of <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> to the Chartreuse to increase the small relict population (Rouland 1980) might jeopardize the long-term persistence of <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> due to the potential risk of crossbreeding (Apollonio&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) which could eventually lead to extinction by hybridization and introgression (Rhymer and Simberloff 1996).  <em>R. r. caucasica</em> – Previously no category assigned at subspecies level. The population size is approx. 6,000 mature individuals and there had been a decline by approx. 70% since the 1960-1970s, which is suspected to continue. The subspecies is therefore assessed as VU C1.<br/> <br/> <em>R. r. tatrica</em> - Listed as Endangered (EN) B1+2ab - has a restricted geographic range and small population of 1,350 individuals (1,000 in Slovakia and 350 in Poland (mean population size for 2014-2018, Ciach and Pęksa 2018; M. Ciach and Ł. Pęksa, unpublished). There are an additional ca. 100 individuals in the Low Tatra Mts (Slovakia) as a result of the introduction of a back-up population between 1969-1976 (Bačkor and Velič 2008), but these are presently hybridized with introduced <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> (<span class=""author"">Zemanová&#160;<em>et al</em>&#160;<span class=""pubyear"">2015) and cannot be accounted for the subspecies <em>tatrica </em>(J. Robovsky, pers. comm. 2020). There has been strong fluctuation in the number of mature individuals (decline of the population from ca. 1,100 individuals in the 1960’s to ca. 220 individuals by the turn of the century; Ciach and Pęksa 2018). The population increased rapidly between 2000 and 2018, with current numbers exceeding the population size prior to the decline (Ciach and Pęksa 2018, M. Ciach and Ł. Pęksa unpublished). Concerns are low genetic variation and a projected problem of hybridization with introduced <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> (<span class=""author"">Zemanová&#160;<em>et al</em>&#160;<span class=""pubyear"">2015).</span></span>","Northern Chamois&#160;inhabit steep, rocky areas mostly in the mountains, utilizing a variety of habitats including alpine meadows, open rocky areas, mixed broadleaf woodland, and coniferous woodland (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). This species occupies rocky areas and alpine meadows, and feeds on grasses, herbs, leaves of trees, buds, shoots, and fungi (Sägesser and Krapp 1986). Females gestate for 170 days and usually have 1 offspring per pregnancy. Females are sexually mature at 2.5 years, while males mature 1-1.5 years later. They live 14-22 years. Females and young occur in flocks of 5-30 animals, while adult males remain solitary.","<p>Poaching and over-hunting are a problem for the species in parts of its range, especially where it occurs outside protected areas and private hunting reserves (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000; Markov et al. 2016). Many of the less numerous subspecies (e.g. <em>R. r. balcanica</em>, <em>R. r. cartusiana</em>, and <em>R. r. tatrica</em>) are threatened by the deliberate introduction of subspecies from other geographic areas (especially <em>R. r. rupicapra</em><em>; e.g. Rouland 1980</em>), leading to hybridisation and genetic swamping (Shackleton 1997; <span class=""author"">Zemanová et al. <span class=""pubyear"">2015; Šprem and Buzan 2016; Iacolina et al. 2019). Human disturbance, particularly as a result of increased tourism and leisure activities in mountain areas, is also a problem (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000; Pęksa &amp; Ciach 2015, Pęksa &amp; Ciach 2018). Competition with domestic livestock and introduced species such as the mouflon <em>Ovis aries</em><em> musimon</em> is a threat to the more vulnerable subspecies, although it is not considered to be a major problem for <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>. <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> does, however, suffer periodic outbreaks of sarcoptic mange, causing local population declines (Shackleton 1997). Habitat loss is a problem in some areas (e.g. for subspecies <em>balcanica </em>in Albania and <em>asiatica</em> in Turkey; Shackleton 1997; Ambarlı 2014). Because its population is very small indeed, subspecies <em>cartusiana </em>is susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic demographic or environmental events (Shackleton 1997, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006).<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra asiatica</em><br/> </span>The main threats are poaching, trophy hunting, habitat degradation and isolation due to the construction of new roads to alpine habitats for mass tourism (Ambarlı 2014). Additional threats include the construction of hydro-electric power plants above 2000 meters, increasing tourism activities, heli-skiing causing avalanches and disturbing the animals during pregnancy, and chasing individuals by using unmanned aerial vehicles in refuge areas. For many years, the main threat to the population was considered to be poaching only. However, hunting regulations were changed in 2010, and the ban on killing females during trophy hunting was lifted because hunters had complained about difficulties in correctly sexing individuals from a distance. Moreover, trophy hunters are sometimes more interested in killing females due to their longer horns compared to males. As a result of the new hunting regulations, and because trophy hunting mostly takes place during the rut and birth seasons, both reproductive success and birth rates have likely also decreased. Additionally, the number of quotas is not determined based on robust scientific data. Instead, most are given out over the desk or by relying on hunters’ observations without knowledge of actual population sizes in wildlife reserves. Alpine tourism and new road constructions in the Kaçkar Mountains for the “Green Belt Roads"" Project by the Ministry of Tourism has caused catastrophic destruction of the prime habitats of Anatolian chamois. Additionally, interspecific competition with wild goats and livestock has probably pushed chamois up to higher altitudes and restricted the subspecies’ range in the alpine zone to mostly above 2,000 m.<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica</em><br/> In Albania, habitat loss is a major threat in some regions due to land demands by the expanding human population. There appears to be no competition from domestic livestock. Poaching does occur, but the extent is not known. In both Bulgaria and Croatia, the major threats are poaching and hybridization with Alpine chamois (Iacolina et. al, 2019). In Rhodope, this is almost complete, and is also a potential danger at Rila. In Croatia, the hybridization zone between the Alpine and Balkan subspecies is in the Velebit mountains (Šprem and Buzan 2016). Outside protected areas, poaching remains a problem. Although there has been a decrease in poaching in Bulgaria in recent years, it still has negative effects on populations. As a result, the majority of suitable habitats in Bulgaria have not been recolonized by chamois. Poaching is wide-spread in the entire country both in national parks and hunting territories. The genetic purity of the subspecies needs to be clarified, especially in West Rodopi, where ten female and 1 male Alpine chamois were introduced from Switzerland in 1977. Their influence on the neighboring subpopulations requires clarification. The influence of disturbance of chamois due to drive-hunting of wild boar, as well as the presence of feral and guard dogs around livestock, also need to be assessed. The Balkan population, which has been isolated for about 100 years, is still small and vulnerable, and poaching has not yet been eliminated (Markov et al. 2016). In Serbia, the population at Tara mountain had declined from 500 to ca. 60 individuals between 1992 and 1996, mainly due to poaching. However, due to conservation measures in the last decade, the number has increased to ca. 120 individuals. The population from Stolovi mountain is extinct, and only isolated individuals are occasionally encountered in the area around the Lim river. Populations from Šar planina are also threatened by poaching and are declining (estimated to be about 100 individuals). At Đerdapska klisura and Zlot, populations are not threatened. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, numbers declined in the last three decades due to poaching (e.g. by more than 80% to 90 individuals at Zelengora mountain). At Prokletije mountain (belonging to both Serbia and Montenegro), the population is not threatened and numbers up to 150 individuals.&#160; In Greece, the main threat is also poaching. All Greek sub-populations suffer from regular poaching to a greater or lesser extent (Papaioannou 2010, 2015, 2016a,b,c, 2020; Bounas et al., 2017).&#160; Poaching is more intensive in the border zones with the neighbouring Balkan countries. Additional problems are: fragmentation due to geographic isolation in restricted areas and resulting very small population sizes, disturbance due to legal hunting of other game species and livestock presence, competition with livestock, increased road accessibility for timbering and livestock keeping close to or inside the species’ key habitats, as well as a lack of an effective state wildlife management system at a national level (Papaioannou 2010, 2015, 2016a,b, 2020; Papaioannou &amp; Kati 2016; EEA, 2019). Genetic effects on one of the northern Greek populations due to re-stocking with individuals of other subspecies from Bulgaria, as well as current road construction for installation of wind power stations, seem to be future threats, too (Papaioannou 2020). Both population size and geographic range are estimated to be less than 10-20% of the carrying capacity in Greece (Papaioannou 2020). This latter point is normally not accounted for in species assessments, which means that particularly in Greece with its extremely small and isolated populations, the Balkan chamois should be listed as higher conservation concern (i.e. vulnerable) than the assessment based on overall population size would suggest.</p>  <p><br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra carpatica</em><br/> Grazing by domestic sheep in summer leads to disturbance and thus to higher dispersal of animals. In some areas, high livestock densities create intense grazing pressure and lead to interspecific competition. Additional concerns are small, fragmented populations and poaching in some areas (Valdez 2011).<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra cartusiana</em><br/> Many factors threaten this subspecies, and the most important include: food and space competition with domestic livestock, red deer <em>Cervus elaphus</em> and introduced mouflon; potential hybridization with introduced <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> (Rouland 1980); over-harvesting and poaching; forestry; summer tourism and winter cross-country skiing. <br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra caucasica</em><br/> The main threat for the subspecies is poaching. In some areas, competition with domestic livestock is a problem, and competition with tur (<em>Capra caucasica</em> and <em>Capra cylindricornis</em>), red deer, and roe deer <em>Capreolus capreolus</em> is also possible.<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra</em><br/> <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> is not threatened overall. However, the ongoing increase in human land use and particularly increases in (winter) outdoor / tourism activities contribute to habitat degradation and disturbance (e.g. Ingold, 2005). In parts of its range, the subspecies was / has been subjected to increased hunting pressure at local scales, in order to prevent browsing damage to mountain forests (e.g. Baumann &amp; Imesch 2010; Wotschikowsky 2010) and to afforestations. In areas managed by the State Forestry Board in Bavaria chamois are managed on the basis of a spatio-temporally structured zonation system. Under legislative regulation, year-round hunting is exerted in small areas to support regeneration of forests with protective attributes (e.g. protection from avalanches and erosion), while in other areas hunting is restricted to few to no individuals. Debates regarding the management practices of chamois population units in some regions / countries have been ongoing, but compelling evidence is often limited. Over the majority of the subspecies’ range, however, harvest rates are generally considered sustainable. Regarding climatic factors, harsh winters (i.e. with a lot of snow) and warm summers may limit population growth in some areas (Vogt et al 2019, Willisch et al. 2013). Climate change seems to exert negative effects on body mass of young chamois (Rughetti &amp; Festa-Bianchet 2012, Mason et al. 2014), but its demographic effect in these populations is still unclear.&#160;Imperio et al. (2014) suggested that positive and negative effects of a changing climate may largely balance out, with an overall positive effect of lower winter snow depth on survival rates, but negative effects from higher spring-summer temperatures on population dynamics. Among the biotic factors that can negatively influence chamois populations are diseases such as infectious keratoconjunctivitis (Degiorgis et al. 2000, Mavrot et al. 2012) and sarcoptic mange (Rossi et al. 2007), competition with livestock (in this case also the danger of disease transmission) or other wild ungulates such as red deer, Alpine ibex <em>Capra ibex</em> or mouflon (e.g. Suter et al. 2005; Bertolino et al. 2009; Chirichella at al. 2012; Darmon et al. 2012; Vogt et al. 2019; Corlatti et al. 2019). Increased predation is expected due to the return of large carnivores such as the Eurasian lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em> (Vogt et al. 2019) and wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> (Gazzola et al. 2007). In 2015, a barbed wire border fence was constructed along the border between Croatia and Slovenia due to the European migrant crisis. This fence represents a major threat to the local chamois population, as it may cause mortality, obstruct seasonal dispersal, and reduce effective population size (Safner et al. 2019).<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica</em><br/> In the past, major threats included poaching and domestic sheep grazing. However, the Tatras are now protected in their entirety in the form of national parks: the Tatranský Národný Park (TANAP) in Slovakia was established in 1949 and the Tatrzański Park Narodowy (TPN) in Poland in 1954. As a result of strict conservation measures, hunting is banned and incidents of poaching are rare (Jamrozy et al. 2007). Sheep grazing, once common all over the Tatras, gradually declined following the creation of the national parks, and since the 1980s has been restricted to mid-forest meadows, which lie at lower altitudes, below the range of occurrence of the Tatra chamois. Currently, disturbance and habitat loss caused by tourism is a major threat to the population. This includes the constant presence of large numbers of tourists in the high mountains and the development or maintenance of tourist infrastructures (ski resorts, hiking trails), which impact the spatial distribution, behaviour and physiology of the Tatra chamois (Zwijacz-Kozica et al. 2013, Pęksa &amp; Ciach 2015, Pęksa &amp; Ciach 2018). In Slovakia, interbreeding with animals from introduced populations of <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> has caused the loss of the back-up population of <em>R. r. tatrica </em><em>in the </em>Low Tatra Mountains (Slovakia; <span class=""author"">Zemanová et al. <span class=""pubyear"">2015<em>), and further gene flow between introduced Alpine and native Tatra chamois can become a serious threat to the population occuring in the Tatra </em></span>Mountains. Both populations (natural, inhabiting the Tatra Mountains and introduced and hybridized in the Low Tatra Mountains) are relatively small, and their effective population sizes may limit the maintenance of genetic diversity and adaptability over the long term. A potential problem is the danger of disease transmission from domestic livestock to the wild population of the Tatra chamois.</p>","<p>The Northern Chamois&#160;as a species is widespread and appears generally stable, especially the Alpine subspecies <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>. However, many of the other subspecies are rare and/or declining:&#160;</p><p><em>R. r. asiatica -&#160;</em>The total population size is estimated between 500 and 750, with a total extent of occurrence (EOO) over 9,000 km<sup>2</sup>, but a very low area of occupancy (AOO). Group sizes in the Kaçkar Mountains have decreased significantly from 40 to 50 individuals in the 1990s to a maximum of 25 individuals (but mostly only 3 to 7) between 2006 and 2012 during mating time observations (Ambarlı 2014). Along with the disappearance from former habitats and increasing habitat fragmentation, the population size of Anatolian Chamois has decreased sharply in the last three decades (by ca. 60-70%, with the greatest reductions in population, AOO and EOO probably occurring between 1980 and 2000; Ambarlı 2014).</p>    <p><em>R. r. balcanica -&#160;</em>The total population numbers less than ten thousand individuals: ca. 500 in Croatia (Šprem and Buzan 2016), less than 1,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (cf. Adamič&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Korjenić&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009), ca. 320 in Central Serbia (data from 2017), ca. 200-300 in Kosovo, ca. 1,400 in Montenegro (Đurović 2018), ca. 1,400 in North Macedonia (V. Maletić pers. comm.), ca. 450-600 in Albania (F. Bego pers. comm.), ca. 2,500-3,000 in Bulgaria (with the largest sub-populations in Rhodopes – ca. 1000 - and Rila – ca. 1000; S. Avramov, pers. comm.), and ca. 1,500 in Greece (i.e. 1330-1765, with 4 populations numbering more than 150, the largest 380 and the smallest no more than 5-15; Papaioannou 2015, 2016a,b, 2020; Papaioannou and Kati 2016). In Bulgaria, the population size increased from 1,000-1,100 individuals estimated in 1997-2000 to 1,600–1,800 in 2005 (200-220 in the Central Balkan range, 450-500 at Rila, 200 in Pirin, and 750-850 in the Western Rhodopes; Spiridonov&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). </p>  <p><em>R. r. carpatica -&#160;</em>Following some fluctuations in population size (Şelaru 1997), chamois numbers in Romania have shown a steady increase from ca. 6,800 in 2008 to ca. 8,150 individuals in 2019. This has been paralleled by an increase in the number of harvested animals from 195 in 2008 to 443 in 2018 (A. Farkas, pers. comm).<br/> <br/> <em>R. r. cartusiana -&#160;</em>The population is currently estimated at ca. 1,500 individuals, with ca. 200 animals harvested in 2017-2018 (Prévost 2018). The population history is as follows: ca. 50 individuals in 1945, 250 in 1972 (Prévost 2018), 35 in 1977, and 67 in 1979 in the north-western nucleus of the introduced population (Rouland 1980), 150 in 1986 (Prévost 2018) and ca. 120 in 1990 (Berducou 1990). Between 2005 and 2016, both the assigned hunting quota and number of harvested chamois increased: in 2005, about 110 chamois were harvested out of a quota of ca. 140, and in 2016, about 180 out of ca. 200 (Chantreau and Gaudry 2019). The genetic integrity of the current <em>R. r. cartusiana</em><em> population is unknown.</em></p><p><em>R. r. caucasica -&#160;</em>The total population estimate for the entire Greater Caucasus is just over 9,000 individuals, and in general, the subspecies is still declining. In Russia, the total is ca. 5,500, with ca. 3,500 in the Western Greater Caucasus, up to 1,000 in the central part, and up to 1,000 in Chechnya and Dagestan (Reports on status of nature conservation in respective regions; Lukarevsky 2018; Yarovenko and Yarovenko 2018). Chamois numbers in Chechnya (mainly on the limestone Rocky Ridge; Lukarevsky 2018) probably amount to at least 300 animals, possibly more. Of all animals in Russia, ca. 1,200 occur in the Kavkazsky Biosphere Reserve (Trepet, 2018), 300 in Sochi NP (Semyonov and Voronin, 2018), ca. 200 in the Teberdinsky Biosphere Reserve (J. Tekeev, pers. comm.), and ca. 250 in the North Ossetinsky Nature Reserve, Tseysky Managed Nature Reserve and Alania National Park (Weinberg, 2018). The population history is as follows: 9,000 chamois on the northern slope in 1972, almost 6,000 of which inhabited Krasnodar Kray, and 1,200 in the Stavropol region (Ravkin, 1975). The population declined, and by the beginning of the 2000s, there were 1,500 in the Western Greater Caucasus (without Kavkazsky reserve), up to 1,300 in the Central Greater Caucasus, and more than 400 animals in Dagestan (Danilkin, 2005). In addition, there were about 1,000 Chamois in the Kavkazsky Biosphere Reserve (Trepet, 2014). In Georgia, combined aerial counts and ground censuses conducted during 2012-2014 produced a maximum number of 3,267 animals in the Greater Caucasus and 500-600 Chamois in Adjara in the Lesser Caucasus (Gurielidze 2015). This also represents a decline from an estimated 5,000 animals at the end of the 1980’s (Arabuli 1989). In Azerbaijan, only 600-800 individuals were left by the end of the 1990s compared to an estimate of 2,000-2,500 animals in the 1950-60s (Guliyev 2000). 341 animals were counted in the Zagatala Nature Reserve in 2015, and 315 in 2018; in Ilisu Nature Reserve, 24 and 18 animals, respectively, in the same years (A. Muradov, pers. comm.). No data are available from Shahdag National Park, the largest protected area in the Azerbaijan part of the Eastern Greater Caucasus. Chamois numbers probably decrease eastwards.&#160;<span class=""tlid-translation"">See Table 1&#160;in supplementary material.</p><p><em>R. r. rupicapra -&#160;</em>This subspecies comprises the bulk of the global Northern Chamois&#160;population, and is widespread and abundant in the Alps. Recent population declines have been suggested for some countries (e.g. Austria, Switzerland and Italy), but this is controversial, as there are large regional differences in population trends in all cases. The situation in Switzerland may provide a good example for the difficulties in inferring population trends from different data sources: In Switzerland, the total population size was estimated at ca. 91,000 in 2018. Compared to 2008, when there was an estimated number of about 96,000 chamois (Eidgenössische Jagdstatistik 2019), this would represent a decline of about 5%. However, as there is no standardized method to infer population abundance or trends of chamois in Switzerland, abundance estimates are not validated, and suspected changes need to be interpreted with care. The number of chamois shot in Switzerland peaked in the 1990’s and has since declined steadily. In 2008, about 17,300 chamois were shot, in 2018 about 13,700, which would correspond to a decline of 21% in ten years (data: Eidgenössische Jagdstatistik, Nov. 2019). However, care must also be taken regarding the interpretation of these data, as hunting regulations and hunting pressure have changed over the years. Reductions in numbers of shot animals therefore do not necessarily reflect population declines (Vogt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). While in some sub-populations, chamois numbers have experienced steady declines in the past 20-30 years, others have been stable or increasing (e.g., Vogt <em>et al.</em> 2019, Willisch&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Willisch pers. comm). A similar situation applies to Austria, where trends in the number of animals shot has differed widely between provinces, while the overall population trend is still under debate (Reimoser&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Germany, a population numbering approximately 1,200 animals today occurs in the federal state of Baden Wuerttemberg (Wotschikowsky&#160;2010; MLR 2019). In the federal state of Saxony, few occasional sightings of individuals that belong to a border population in Czechia occur (Hertweck and Riebe 2009). The bulk of the German chamois populations occur in the federal state of Bavaria for which Wotschikowsky (2010) suggested an estimate of roughly 20,000 individuals in 2010. Current population size and trends have been debated amongst different stakeholder groups, which resulted in the initiation of several research projects to inform this debate, but results are pending to date. In Italy, the total population estimate is ca. 137,000 individuals, with ca. 124,800 outside (in 2014; Pellicioli 2019) and ca. 12,600 inside National Parks (Gran Paradiso 2019: ca. 7,000; Stelvio 2019: ca. 3,500; Val Grande 2013: ca. 800; Dolomiti Bellunesi: ca. 1,300; Italian National Park Authorities). Given annual population counts of 119,042 (2009), 120,400 (2010), 123,475 (2011), 123,666 (2012), 126,825 (2013), and 124,847 (2014) outside National Parks (Pelliccioli 2019), the number of chamois (including kids)&#160;in the Italian Alps appears relatively stable. Nevertheless, declines have been detected in some populations, particularly high density areas: for example, in the Trentino sector of the Stelvio National Park, the decline was over 60% between the mid-1990s and 2019. In France, chamois abundance and distribution range have shown an increase over most of the overall monitoring period, although the total abundance may have tended to stabilize during the last 15 years (1988: 31,680, 1994: 55,570, 2005: 98,715; 2010: 103,345; Corti 2012; Barboiron&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Although the population expansion still seems to be ongoing at intermediate and low altitudes (Barboiron&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), contrasting local trends have appeared in other areas, including some local population decreases even in national parks such as in the Ecrins National Park and the Vanoise National Park. Difficulties in inferring <em>R. r. rupicapra </em>population sizes and trends also include limited economic and human resources allocated to absolute abundance surveys, and changes in survey methodology including the promotion of relative abundance indices (Loison&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006; Michallet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Although this may fulfill the objective of making local surveys cheaper for the purpose of adjusting annual harvest rates, it may weaken the availability and accuracy of total population estimates (e.g. Jullien and Cornillon 2017; Barboiron&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In practice, such indices of relative abundance are only reliable when calculated over a sufficient number of surveys per year and over a sufficient number of years (Loison&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), which is often not fulfilled (e.g. Chantreau and Gaudry 2019). <span class=""tlid-translation"">Partial participation of stakeholders further compromises the reliability of population monitoring, and the corrections of underestimation biases (De Danieli and Sarasa 2015) also remain an open question.&#160;</span></p><em>    R. r. tatrica</em> - The total population size is currently estimated at 1,350 individuals (1000 in Slovakia and 350 in Poland, based on the mean population size for 2014-2018, Ciach and Pęksa 2018; M. Ciach and Ł. Pęksa , unpublished). Numbers of the Tatra Chamois had declined steadily since the 1960s (Jurdíková 2000) from ca. 1,100 individuals to ca. 220 individuals by the turn of the century (Ciach and Pęksa 2018). After the period of decline, the population increased rapidly between 2000 and 2018, with current numbers exceeding the population size prior to the decline (Ciach and Pęksa 2018; M. Ciach and Ł. Pęksa unpublished). There is an additional population of ca. 100 individuals in the Low Tatra Mts (Slovakia), which was established from 30 individuals from the Tatra population and introduced as a back-up population between 1969-1976. It increased subsequently and has persisted to date (Bačkor and Velič 2008, <span class=""author"">Zemanová&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;<span class=""pubyear"">2015), although nowadays, this population is displaying high levels of introgression of the <em>R. r. rupicapra </em>genome.</span>",Stable,"<p>The Northern Chamois is native to mountainous parts of central and southern Europe and Asia Minor, where it occurs as seven subspecies: <em>R. r.</em> <em>asiatica, balcanica</em>, <em>carpatica</em>, <em>cartusiana</em>, <em>caucasica, rupicapra</em> and <em>tatrica</em> (Shackleton 1997, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). It occurs from 200 m to 3,500 m asl.&#160; It has been introduced to Czechia and New Zealand (not mapped), and possibly to Argentina (no information on its presence nowadays). <br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>asiatica </em>only occurs in the northeastern mountains of the Black Sea, eastern parts of Anatolia (Turkey) and the southwestern regions of Georgia in three mostly isolated populations. The Kaçkar Mountain and the transboundary populations between Turkey and Georgia have not been connected since 2000 due to the large dam water reservoirs in the province of Artvin. The eastern Anatolian and Kaçkar Mountain populations have become almost isolated after increasing highway constructions and decreasing population sizes, and there is no evidence that they are connected any longer. Previous distribution maps by Turan (1984) and Lovari and Scala (1984) showed a wide coverage in eastern and northeastern Anatolia including Mount Ağrı, Cilo and Kaçkar, but recent studies have indicated that Anatolian Chamois have been disappearing from former habitats (Ambarlı 2014). </p>  <p>The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>balcanica</em> occurs in Croatia (Dinara and Biokovo Mts.), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria (four main massifs), and Greece. In Serbia, it inhabits the mountain Tara, the area around the Lim river, Đerdapska klisura and Zlot. In Kosovo, it occurs in the mountains of Prokletije, Mokra Gora, Koritnik and Šar Planina. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, it inhabits the mountains of Zelengora, Prenj, Čvrsnica, Čabulja, Veleža, Bjelašnica, Treskavica and Sušica. In Montenegro, it is found in the mountains of Durmitor, Prokletije and Orjen, and in the Tara river canyon. In Bulgaria, there are five distinct sub-populations: Western Rhodopes, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha and Central Balkan. The population in Vitosha was reintroduced after 2000 (Valchev&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). A reintroduction project has also started in the Western Stara Planina, but requires additional animals in order to be successful. In Greece, there are 30 distinct sub-populations forming six discrete population blocks in the following mountain ranges: Northern Pindus (12 sub-populations), Central and Southern Pindus (7), South mainland mts (5), N-NW mts (1), Olympus mt (1), Rhodope mts (4) (Papaioannou 2010, 2015, 2016a, 2016b, 2020; Papaioannou and Kati 2016). The first three, and possibly the fourth, seem to share a common genepool, whereas the rest diverge slightly (Papaioannou&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The area of occupancy at the national level is estimated between 1950 – 2475 km<sup>2</sup> (EEA 2019, Papaioannou 2020). <br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>carpatica</em> occurs in many populations in Romania throughout the Transylvania alps and the Carpathian mountains. There have been a number of successful re-introductions (Shackleton 1997).<br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>cartusiana</em> is endemic to France, where it is restricted to a 350 km<sup>2 </sup>area of the Chartreuse limestone massif, centred around Grenoble, at the western edge of the French Alps. <br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>caucasica</em> is restricted to the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Its distribution in the Lesser Caucasus is currently confined to the northern and western parts, Adjara-Imereti Mountain Range (Vereshchagin 1947, Gurielidze 2015). In the Greater Caucasus, the chamois sporadically inhabits all three highest ranges, and sometimes occurs at lower altitudes. The outer limits of its distribution in the Greater Caucasus have not changed much during the last 50 years, except for the westernmost part, where it is no longer present. </p>  <p>The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>rupicapra </em>is found in Austria, southern Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, eastern France, Slovenia and NW Croatia. While the range has remained similar to the previous assessment in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, it has increased in France as a result of natural and assisted recolonisations.The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>tatrica </em>has a small island-like distribution range of some 300 km<sup>2</sup> and occurs in the open habitats above the tree line in the Tatra Mountains of Poland and Slovakia, including the ranges of Western, High and Belianske Tatra Mountains (Jamrozy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In Slovakia, it had also been introduced to the Low Tatra Mountains (Shackleton 1997), but this population is now hybridized with introduced <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> (<span class=""author"">Zemanová&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;<span class=""pubyear"">2015).</span></p>",This species is widely hunted through its range.,Terrestrial,"<p>The species is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and in Annex V of the EU Habitats and Species Directive (higher protection applies to some subspecies). Chamois occur in many protected areas. In general, conservation recommendations that apply to all subspecies include ensuring that any harvest is sustainable (e.g. through research, monitoring, legislation, and international cooperation), reducing poaching (e.g. through legislation, enforcement, education and awareness-raising, and provision of alternative livelihoods where necessary), reducing the impacts of human disturbance (e.g. by providing refugia in areas with intense tourism and hunting pressure), preventing habitat degradation, and protecting the genetic integrity of populations (by avoiding translocations of 'foreign' subspecies that could hybridise with the local population). Monitoring of all subspecies is important, especially those that are rare and/or declining. Due to increasing evidence of negative effects on chamois through interspecific competition with red deer, red deer (re-)introductions should be avoided in areas with chamois presence, and due to the danger of disease transmission from domestic livestock to wild ungulates, prophylaxis of domestic animals against infectious keratoconjunctivitis should become routine. Particularly the uncertainties in population trends in central Europe highlight the importance of methodologically consistent long-term monitoring programmes.</p>    <em>R. r. asiatica -</em>&#160;The Anatolian Chamois has so far been the only subspecies categorized as DD. There is only a limited number of studies about the species in Turkey. It has been fully protected by the Land Hunting Law 4915 since 2003 (Official Gazette of Turkish Republic 2003). However, continued trophy hunting has been permitted by the Directory of Game Animals since 1989, and poaching still continues mainly on the population of the northeastern Black Sea Region and transboundary populations. To protect chamois and stop the population decline in the 1990s, five wildlife reserves were established, but they have no viable populations any longer. Both the number of game wardens and conservation efforts in high mountain areas are inadequate, and limited resources are allocated to monitoring efforts and law enforcement.   <em>R. r. balcanica</em> is listed in Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. In Croatia, one of two Balkan chamois habitats – the Dinara Mountain - has been listed in the Natura 2000 sites in 2019. In Greece, the conservation status of the Balkan Chamois at the national level is U<sub>2</sub>-(i) (EEA, 2019), and it is included in the Greek National Red Data book as NT (Near Threatened, Legakis and Maragou 2009). It is a fully protected species, and hunting has been banned throughout the country since 1969 (Law 86/69). Most of the subspecies’ population ranges have been included in a no-hunting legislation status (Wildlife sanctuaries). In addition, several chamois ranges overlap - entirely or partly - with Natura 2000 sites, either SCIs or SPAs (Papaioannou 2016a, 2016c, 2020), and most of them are located within the boundaries of protected areas (e.g. extended National Parks, namely: Northern Pindos, Olympus, Oiti, Rodope, Tzoumerka-Peristeri-Aracthos gorge). The Greek Ministry of Environment has recently (2015) implemented monitoring projects for species listed on Annex 17 of the European directive 92/43 EU (EEA 2019) - including the Balkan Chamois - and the National Action Plan for this subspecies has just been accomplished (Papaioannou 2020). In Bulgaria, Balkan Chamois have been protected since 2007 (with poaching fines of 2500 euro and up to 5 years of emprisonment) and a National Action Plan was developed. The species is listed as Endangered in the National Red Book, but the status of U1 vs. U2 has been disputed. Although a small population growth at the national level was registered during the previous reporting period, the Balkan Chamois still inhabits less than half of its potential habitat in Bulgaria, and the present population size is several times lower than the potential number for the country. The distribution in Rila, Pirin and the Central Balkan is mostly within the borders of national parks where hunting is strictly prohibited, and almost all present Bulgarian populations and the majority of the potential chamois habitat are in Natura 2000 sites. The main tool to decrease poaching in Bulgaria is through community-based conservation, i.e. encouraging local hunters through a small number (35-55) of hunting permits, education of mountaineers and local communities. Under the National Action Plan, a National Chamois working group was established in order to coordinate the activities of the plan but it deals mainly with hunting derogations (Avramov at al. 2010). A few joint control actions against illegal trophies of chamois were carried out. More than fifteen trophies were confiscated and trials started against some of the most famous poachers. A large-scale media campaign was initiated against poaching. The Ministry of Environment organized the first National Chamois counting in 2009. The counts continue but their reliability has been compromised in the last years. The monitoring of chamois needs to be revised and improved.   <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> has been subject to intensive conservation management, including reintroductions. The subspecies was distinguished by Couturier (1938), while it was not distinguished from <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> during certain management actions and in many reports (Corti 1995). This uneven recognition has had substantial impacts on its conservation until nowadays. <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> was not assessed at the subspecific level in the Red List of Mammals of France in 2009 (IUCN France <em>et al.</em> 2009), while it was listed as vulnerable with unknown population trend in the Red List of Mammals of France in 2017 (IUCN France <em>et al.</em> 2017). It was considered as formerly abundant in Chartreuse, but overhunting and poaching probably put the population at risk of extinction from WWII to 1970 (Rouland 1980). Restocking and restauration programmes are cited in some references of grey literature (Corti 2006). During the 1974-76 period, 29 <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> individuals from the Bauges hunting reserve and the Markstein were translocated to the north-western part of the Chartreuse (Rouland 1980). During the 1990-92 period, 26 chamois assumed to be <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> were translocated from the south-western part of the Chartreuse to the south-eastern part (Michallet and Toïgo 2000). In practice, monitoring focused on estimating the relative abundance of chamois in Chartreuse is only partially fulfilled and suggests high interannual variability and an overall stability during the 2010-2016 period (e.g. Chantreau and Gaudry 2019). The conservation of <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> should incorporate improved monitoring and reporting of abundance, sustainable management of hunting pressure and active management of the risk of extinction by hybridization and introgression, beyond monitoring pressures from interspecific competition.  <em>R. r. caucasica </em>is listed in the Red Data Book of Azerbaijan as a “Species whose numbers declined in the past and are still low” (Guliyev 2013c). It is also listed in the Red List of Georgia as Endangered (EN/A2a) (Decree 2014). In both countries, these listings exclude any extractive use, but do not lead to restrictions on land use or development projects affecting the species and its habitat (S. Michel, pers. comm.). In the Soviet Union, the chamois was considered rare, but was not included in Red Data Books. Later, it was still not listed in the Red List of the Russian Federation. Now there are plans to include the species in the new version of the Red List of Russia. <em>R. r. tatrica</em> is listed in Annexes II* and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. It has been strictly protected by law since 1868 on the Polish side of the Tatra Mountains (the world's first parliamentary act on the protection of animal species). In spite of being strictly protected by law, numbers of Tatra Chamois continued to decline. In the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century, the whole Tatra massif became protected in the form of national parks: the Slovakian Tatranský Národný Park was formed in 1949 and the Polish Tatra National Park was formed in 1954. Moreover, the Tatras have been designated as an International Biosphere Reserve and are one of the areas protected by the Natura 2000 network in the frame of the Habitats Directive. Today, the entire population and its habitats are protected year-round in both the Polish and Slovakian national parks. The species is listed in the Polish Red Data Book as critically endangered. <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> introduced into Slovakia <em>should be managed for minimizing the threat of genetic introgression from dispersing males into the populations of </em><em>R. r. tatrica</em><em>. The population of </em><em>R. r. tatrica</em><em> in the Low Tatras, affected by introgression of </em><em>R. r. rupicapra</em><em>, should be maintained separately from the pure </em><em>R. r. tatrica</em><em> in the High Tatras</em><em> </em>(Zemanová <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><strong></strong>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In Finland, high proportions of spruce forest and agricultural land in the landscape are associated with greater reproductive success, possibly due to higher small mammal numbers, although birds avoid hunting in large open areas such as agricultural fields (Korpimäki &amp; Hakkarainen 2012). Old-growth forest is particularly important for lifetime reproductive success, potentially because it maintains higher prey numbers and refuges against large avian predators (Korpimäki &amp; Hakkarainen 2012).","The breeding population of this species fluctuates with vole cycles and the depth of annual snow cover, which inhibits foraging. Forestry can reduce primary prey populations, remove forest structure necessary for foraging, and eliminate nest cavities (Holt<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1999). Old-growth forest is particularly important - significant declines in northern Europe since the 1990s have been associated with loss of old-growth boreal forest due to clear-felling&#160;&#160;(Korpimäki &amp; Hakkarainen 2012).

Mortality from intentional poisoning, which appears to be a particular problem in hunting reserves where game is commercially exploited, may once again be on the increase (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C.

This is of particular concern, as the dip in the population in the late 1990s was caused by additional mortality due to poisoning events, with the Doñana National Park population seriously affected by the illegal use of poisoned bait&#160;during this period (Ortega&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009, Ferrer <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Electrocution remains a significant source of mortality, despite mitigation measures leading to a highly significant reduction in the numbers of birds killed (<span class=""msoIns"">Lopez-Lopez <em>et al. </em><span class=""msoIns"">2011). This is a particular problem for immature eagles, and of six satellite-tagged individuals that visited Morocco in 2015 one was electrocuted, prompting the discovery of four further carcasses of immature birds near two recently installed high-voltage powerlines (Godino<em> et al.</em> 2016).

The development of large areas of land for the production of renewable energy so far does not appear to have had negative impacts, however one individual was found dead in Andalucía in 2012 (J. R.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure).

The spread of large-scale farming, modernisation of agricultural methods and the reduction in the number of hollow trees may have driven its extirpation from areas in France and Spain (Holt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, König 2008). Urban developments may also lead to a loss of habitat (Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Switzerland, suitable habitat has been fragmented by spread of viniculture and agricultural intensification (Holt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999) and land abandonment leading to loss of grassland habitats favoured by the species is also a threat (Sergio <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Israel pesticide use reduced the population, however increases have occurred since the 1970s (Holt <em>et al</em>. 1999). Locally, increases in predator populations, such as Tawny Owls (<em>Strix aluco</em><em>)&#160;</em>may lead to decreases in this species (König 2008). Hunting, along migration routes in Italy and Malta, are also thought to impact the species (Tucker and Heath 1994).

It inhabits coral reefs and surrounding habitats on the continental and insular shelves at depths from the surface down to 70 m. The&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">coral reef area weighted relative population level of Yellow Stingray was estimated to have increased by 9.7% over the past three generation lengths (29 years). This species is mainly threatened by habitat loss and degradation of coral reefs and seagrass due to climate change, and small-scale exploitation for fisheries and the aquarium industry. In other areas such as western Venezuela and Colombia there is some bycatch mortality from fishing.&#160;There is no evidence of population decline, the species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold, and the Yellow Stingray is assessed as Least Concern.","The Yellow Stingray occurs in habitats surrounding coral reefs on the continental and insular shelves at depths of 1 m to greater than 70 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 76 cm total length (TL) (McEachran and Fechhelm 1998, Weigmann 2016); male and female size-at-maturity is 20 cm TL (Yáñez-Aranciba and Amezcua-Linares 1979); reproduction is biennial; size at birth is ~26 cm TL; fecundity is low (1–5 pups/litter) (Trinnie <em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.</em> 2012, Last&#160;<em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.</em> 2016). Age data have not been published for this species, but preliminary estimates give a female age-at-maturity of ~5 years, and a maximum age of 14 years, which result in an estimated generation length of 9.5 years (F.I. Trinnie unpubl. data 2019).<p></p>",There is considerable threat from habitat degradation and loss due to climate change as the species is dependent on coral reef and seagrass habitats (Ward-Paige <em>et al. </em>2011). This species is threatened by artisanal fisheries exploitation for food and for use as bait in parts of its range in some central American countries. The Yellow Stingray is occasionally collected for use in personal aquariums. This species may also decline due to recovery of their predators such as the Goliath Grouper (<em>Epinephelus itajara</em>) in Florida (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).,"There are two sources of population trend information: (1) a self-reported SCUBA diver data set&#160;from the&#160;Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REFF), and (2)&#160;the Global Finprint project, which is a global scale initiative to assess the spatial variation in status of sharks and rays on coral reefs. From 2015 to 2018, it sampled over 400 reefs as well as accessed legacy data from other research programs (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;Using data from the Reef Environmental Education Foundation, a self-reported SCUBA divers data set, the Yellow Stingray was widely distributed throughout the greater-Caribbean from central Florida to northern South America, and from the northwestern Gulf of Mexico to the Antilles. In total, the Yellow Stingray was observed on 5,658 surveys (6.7% sighting frequency) out of nearly 84,000 surveys with the highest occurrence in the regions surrounding Cuba. Overall, sighting frequency declined from 20.5% in 1994 to 4.7% in 2007 with a standardized decline rate of 0.11% (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;Using data from the Reef Environmental Education Foundation, a self-reported SCUBA diver dataset, sighting frequency declined by 70% decline in over 1.5 generation lengths. This dataset focusses on coral reefs, yet this species is distributed over a much broader range of habitats and hence the Global Finprint project analysis is more likely to encompass the wider range of habitats of this species and also avoid the heterogeneity of the volunteer and SCUBA-focussed REFF data.<br/><p></p><p>Spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed from the Global Finprint project that sampled in nations containing 73.6% of the coral reefs within the Yellow Stingray’s known range from 2015 to 2018. This is the largest data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimate population size relative to a reference level indicating natural levels of shark predation. Reef level relative population estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted relative population level of Yellow Stingray was estimated as 109.7% (standard error 73.8–145.5%) and the 9.7% increase was assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (29 years) (see Supplementary Information). This&#160;equated to a small increase in overall estimated population, the result of large increase in Jamaica, Florida, Dominican Republic, and Colombia outweighing decreases in the Lesser Antilles, Belize, Cuba, and Turks and Caicos.&#160;The relative population estimates indicate an overall stable population size, therefore based on Global Finprint data the Yellow Stingray meets the criteria for listing as Least Concern.</p>",Stable,"The Yellow Stingray is found in the western Atlantic from North Carolina to Florida in the United States, Gulf of Mexico&#160;and throughout the Caribbean (including the Greater and Lesser Antilles), Central America and to Guyana in the northern coast of South America (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).",This stingray is primarily collected for personal aquariums.

209530568,12590,Macroderma gigas,Vulnerable,C1,2021,2019-04-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion C1 because total population size is  estimated to be between 4,000 to 6,000 mature individuals with an  overall estimated continuing decline of &gt;10% in 24 years (three  generations) (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). The recent and likely  future declines are for a variety of identified operating key threats in  most populations across its range. The species comprises several  geographically and genetically isolated populations across northern  Australia (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999). There is evidence for declines in the southern-most populations of Queensland (Augusteyn <em>et al.</em>  2018), and in Western Australia there has been loss of some well-known  major roost sites, ongoing and increasing encroachment on natural caves  by mining-related activity and a persistent threat of collapse of  disused mine structures inhabited by the species. The Australian  Commonwealth Government listed this species in May 2016 as Vulnerable  under Australia’s national environmental legislation. This species has  also been upgraded to Endangered in 2017 under Queensland state  legislation.","<em>Macroderma gigas </em>is the second-largest echolocating species of bat in  the world, and the largest in Australia, weighing up to 150 g and having  a wingspan of 60 cm. They are present in a wide variety of habitats,  from the arid, rocky landscapes of the Pilbara region in Western  Australia, to tropical savanna woodlands and rainforests further north  and east. They rely on underground roosts with warm, humid microclimates  to maintain their heat and water balance (they do not enter torpor,  Leitner and Nelson 1967, Baudinette <em>et al.</em> 2000), especially in the more arid regions or at drier times of the year and during breeding (Pettigrew <em>et al.</em>  1986, Churchill and Helman 1990, Churchill 1991, Armstrong and Anstee  2000). As a result, roost availability is restricted to relatively few  subterranean structures, though individuals are sometimes found in old  mines and caves with cooler and drier conditions. Roosts in natural  caves are found commonly in the deeper limestone caves, tower karst and  sinkholes, sandstone formations, granite boulder piles and ironstone  landscapes (Toop 1985, Armstrong and Anstee 2000, K.N. Armstrong  unpublished data).<br/><br/>This species is carnivorous–their diet consists  of small mammals (including other bats), birds, reptiles, frogs and  large insects, though it can vary according to region and the seasonal  availability of some prey types, and the proportion of larger  invertebrates can be high (Pettigrew <em>et al.</em> 1986, Schulz 1986, Boles 1999, Claramunt <em>et al.</em>  2019). They forage either by perching in vegetation and ambushing  passing prey in the air or on the ground, or by gleaning surfaces,  including the ground. Echolocation calls are short and strongly  multi-harmonic, as is typical of the family. They also make several  social calls that are audible to humans (‘chirps’, ‘squabbles’ and  ‘twitters’, Kulzer <em>et al.</em> 1984, Guppy <em>et al.</em> 1985, Pettigrew <em>et al.</em>  1986), though there is an unresolved issue over whether some ultrasonic  non-echolocation calls attributed to them in the Pilbara (McKenzie and  Bullen 2009) are derived exclusively from other cave-roosting bats (K.N.  Armstrong unpublished data). Previous studies in Queensland have shown  that foraging areas were an average of 1.9 km from roosts and 62 ha in  size (Tidemann <em>et al.</em> 1985), though their wing morphology and the  size of some colonies suggests they are capable of a much greater  nightly range (Bullen and McKenzie 2002). Most prey is taken to a  feeding perch in trees, rock overhangs, or cave entrances to be  consumed, and feeding sites can be relatively common compared to diurnal  roost sites.<br/><br/>Females mostly give birth to a single young, although  pregnant females with twins in utero have been trapped in the Northern  Territory (Hanrahan <em>et al.</em> unpublished), and most females breed by two  years of age (Hoyle <em>et al.</em> 2001). Parturition occurs over a month  commencing in mid-October, and young can be shifted to other caves as  caves became warmer as summer progresses. Juvenile bats commence flying  at seven weeks with all young capable of flight by the end of January  (Toop 1985). Females have high fidelity to their natal roosts, with  males having a greater tendency to disperse (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1999). Relatively few breeding sites are known, and most are not explicitly protected or managed (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1997, Armstrong and Anstee 2000, Richards <em>et al.</em> 2008, Worthington Wilmer 2012). Generation time is estimated at 8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).","A variety of threats to the survival of this species have been  identified as currently operating or having the potential to cause  decline (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). <em>Macroderma gigas</em> is very  vulnerable to disturbance in its roost sites, and will readily fly into  daylight following the casual entry of the public or searches by  biologists, where it is vulnerable to predation by raptors and general  exposure to the external environment. Some of the known roosts readily  accessible by people are not managed. Bats may not return to a roost for  months or years after trapping activity, depending on how this is  undertaken. The most serious threat is the loss of roost sites, which  can occur from a variety of causes. Renewed interest in economic  reserves of remaining ore beneath historical mine workings has the  potential to cause disturbances and loss of habitat, and there has been  recent evidence of this in the Pilbara region. There is also an  increasing level of encroachment on cave roosts in ironstone habitats by  surface mining and associated exploration activity. The collapse,  flooding and blocking of entrances are realistic sources of potential  catastrophic loss to the large colonies that have been established in  historical and disused gold and copper mines. There has also been recent  evidence that cane toads contribute to the mortality of <em>M. gigas</em>, and  there are other unknown factors that appear to have caused very recent  but patchy declines in the Northern Territory (White <em>et al.</em> 2016). Genetic studies have demonstrated that it is potentially susceptible to cane toad toxin (Shine <em>et al.</em>  2016). Entanglement in barbed wire fences is known to have caused local  declines in the Pilbara after the ongoing entanglement of entire small  colonies (Armstrong and Anstee 2000). Pollution in old mines and an  unidentified herpes virus have also been identified as possible threats  (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). For the populations at the southern  limits of the species' range, the general paucity of suitable roost  sites, the geographic distance between existing colonies, and the  evident complete lack of gene flow indicates that these populations are  totally isolated and will not be rescued by immigration or recolonised  should local extinctions occur (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1999).  They can be captured inadvertently in pit traps used for small  terrestrial vertebrate surveys, depending on the width of the pit mouth  (Diete <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Population genetic studies showed that while <em>M. gigas</em> is distributed  widely over northern Australia, it occurs as a collection of population  isolates in several regions, including the Pilbara and Kimberley regions  of Western Australia, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and three  groups in Queensland (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999). The  structuring of populations is partly a consequence of the highly  philopatric nature of females, which seldom move from their natal  roosts. Further population genetic studies have revealed the effect of  roost philopatry within regions, which also promotes population  structuring on a smaller scale (K N. Armstrong <em>et al.</em> unpublished).<br/><br/>It  is relatively straightforward to make verifiable counts of<em> Macroderma  gigas </em>as they leave their roosts in caves and mines, especially with  video recordings. There has been no systematic approach for census, but  counts or estimates have been made at several extant colonies over the  past two decades. Colonies in natural caves typically comprise isolated  individuals or small groups of up to <em>ca</em> 30 individuals. Disused mines  can provide a refuge for several hundred individuals. The largest colony  has been recorded in a horizontal adit at Pine Creek in the Northern  Territory - historical counts were 1,200-1,500 individuals, but more  recent estimates with video technology gave a count of around 550  individuals. The largest recorded colonies are all in disused mines,  some of which have probably disappeared. Various estimates of total  population size have been advanced based on a combination of counts at  some roosts, plus calculations based on Area of Occupancy, but there is  no robust measure of abundance across the full range (summarised in  Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). Totals differ between authors, with  Worthington Wilmer (2012) suggesting somewhere between 4,000 - 6,000, and  the previous IUCN Red List account containing an estimate of 7,000-9,000  (McKenzie and Hall 2008) - but all agree that there are less than 10,000  individuals in existence.",Decreasing,"<em>Macroderma gigas</em> is endemic to Australia, though there is an unverified  record in Papua New Guinea (Filewood 1983). It ranges across northern  Australia, from the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia,  the Top End of the Northern Territory, with scattered colonies in the  Gulf Coastal and Mount Isa Inlier bioregions, the eastern side of Cape  York Peninsula, and a few localities in central-eastern Queensland  (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are many sites in central  Australia where the species has declined since European arrival, as is  evident from historical sightings and subfossil remains, plus numerous  other sites containing fossils (reviews in Molnar <em>et al.</em> 1984, Churchill and Helman 1990, Armstrong and Anstee 2000).",,Terrestrial,"<em>Macroderma gigas</em> occurs on numerous conservation reserves, but there are  also many known colonies that do not occur on lands that are managed  for wildlife or that are subject to scrutiny, including both pastoral  stations and small-scale mining or exploration leases. There is good  potential for effective conservation of this species and ameliorating  declines if efforts can be coordinated under a national recovery and  management plan, and with resource allocation and partnership amongst  government, industry and researchers. A programme of standardised  non-invasive monitoring at key roost sites would be helpful for  informing regional and local management approaches (Armstrong and Anstee  2000; Armstrong 2010, 2011; Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is a  need for priority attention on colonies in old, disused mine  adits-requiring scrutiny, protection and repair of sites and solutions  to allow sharing of underground structures between the interest of both  mining and bats. The encroachment of iron ore mining on roost habitat in  Western Australia is well regulated but would benefit from further  information about the effectiveness of buffer zones, the potential for  artificial roost habitat creation (as a measure of last resort), the  size, seasonal occupancy and breeding status of local occurrences in  project areas, and regional context to aid risk assessment and  management. There is also good awareness of the need for unbarbed top  strands of wire on livestock fences in the Pilbara, and mining companies  consider the risk of entanglements for fences on their leases,  particularly around new infrastructure. The outcomes from population  genetic studies need to be part of management and conservation  responses, in particular information about female site fidelity and the  distinctiveness of the population isolates. Postgraduate research into  acoustic ecology is underway and will resolve issues regarding their  acoustic identification. There are several captive colonies in zoos and  wildlife parks, which are bred and managed for genetic diversity. <em>M.  gigas</em> was only recently specially protected under national environmental  legislation in Australia, reversing a previous delisting that has  diverted attention away from this species that is deserving of better  consideration.",Australasian,,false,false,Global
