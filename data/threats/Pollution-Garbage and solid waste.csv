500780,11150,Lagocephalus gloveri,Data Deficient,,2014,2011-06-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Lagocephalus gloveri</em><span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>is distributed from the Andaman Sea east to  Indonesia, north to southern Japan, including the Yellow and Bohai seas, and can be found at depths ranging from zero to 100 metres. It is common in parts of its range. Adults inhabit the  continental  shelf over sandy or muddy bottoms, and juveniles can be found in   estuaries. Unpublished data indicate that this species may be a junior synonym of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus cheesmani</span>, and there is taxonomic confusion in several species of the genus including<span style=""font-style: italic;""> L. cheesemanii</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. gloveri, L. spadiceus</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. wheeleri</span>. <em>Lagocephalus&#160;gloveri</em> is a popular food fish in China, Taiwan and Japan. There is little species-specific population information available. This species is non-toxic and safe for consumption as processed and fresh fish product. It appears to be landed in large quantities in parts of its range, but does not appear to be particularly valuable. Based on population trends seen in other species of commercially important pufferfishes it is inferred that this species is undergoing population declines in parts of its range. It is also likely to be impacted by coastal habitat degradation, particularly near estuaries and river  mouths. Suspected population declines from exploitation and habitat degradation are not quantifiable and therefore do not meet the thresholds for a threatened category.&#160;Pending clarification concerning this species' distribution and population status, this species is assessed as Data Deficient.&#160;The taxonomy of this and several other species of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus</span> remains unresolved.<br/><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""></span>","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> is a tropical species found at depths ranging from 0-100 m. Adults inhabit the continental shelf where they are found over sandy or muddy bottoms. Juveniles can be found in estuaries (Matsuura and Liu pers comm. 2011). <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> feeds on molluscs, crustaceans and fishes. It is most similar to <em>L. spadiceus</em> and <em>L. guentheri </em>in appearance (Matsuura <em>et al.</em> 2011).<p>Puffers of the genus <em>Lagocephalus</em> are globally distributed in warm shallow waters, however classification at the species level in <em>Lagocephalus</em> has not yet been studied in depth, causing confusion in the status of several species including <em>L. cheesemanii</em>, <em>L. gloveri</em>, <em>L. spadiceus</em>, and <em>L. wheeleri </em>(Matsuura <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).</p>","<strong>Pufferfish fishery<br/></strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> is impacted by pufferfish fisheries in parts of its range. In Japan, Pufferfish landings have declined since the early 1990s. Concern about the fishery centers on the most valuable and preferred species, <em>Takifugu rubripes</em>,&#160;which, as of 2010, was considered depleted in Japan.<em> </em>Landings of <em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in Japan had declined to 5% of annual landings in 1987. Landings of ""other pufferfish"", a category which includes <em>L. gloveri, </em>were maximized after the decline in <em>T. rubripes </em>landings. These ""other pufferfish"" have declined from a peak of roughly 400 tonnes in 1999 to less than 100 tonnes in 2007, a decline of roughly 75%. Declines in landings have been attributed to the effects of highly-effective long-line fishing (Kawata 2012).<br/><br/>Fishery-dependent data from China showed declines in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of<em> L. gloveri</em> from 2001 to 2003, however this data may represent several species of this genus. In the Zhoushan Islands <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. gloveri</span> contributed about 15% of the total salted/dried tetraodontiform fish products found in markets. In northern Taiwan, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. gloveri</span> accounted for 80% of the tetraodontiform fish capture volume (uncited/unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Habitat degradation<br/></strong>Furthermore, habitat degradation is occurring in many coastal areas within this species' range, particularly near river mouths (J. Liu pers. comm. 2011). In the semi-enclosed regions of the North Bohai and Yellow Seas, large amounts of industrial and municipal effluents containing heavy metals, particularly arsenic, have been implicated in the deterioration of coastal environments (Luo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Heavy metals have also been implicated in the degradation of the heavily populated and industrialized Pearl River delta region in southern China (Cheung <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the Gulf of Thailand, coastal habitat degradation has resulted from pollution, primarily from untreated municipal and industrial waste water, as well as a rapid decrease in mangrove forests, coral reefs, and fisheries resources (Cheevaporn and Menasveta 2003).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagacephalus gloveri</span> is common and can be locally abundant (K. Matsuura and L. Jing pers. comm. 2011). It is common in Taiwan (Shao pers. comm. 2011) and in the east China Sea (M. Liu and J.

On a regional scale, the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1999 resulted in fisheries agreements reached between Japan, South Korea, and China. These agreements restructured fishery management by giving coastal countries the ability to regulate foreign fishing vessels. The Fisheries Agency of Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which led to the establishment of an off-fishing season, restriction on minimum body size, improvements to fishing grounds, and other measures. The plan was extended past 2010 to 2012 due to the failure of <em>L. gloveri</em> to recover (Kawata 2012).</p><p><strong>Other conservation measures</strong><br/>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>L. gloveri</em>, however its distribution overlaps with several marine protected areas.</p>","",,false,false,Global
507698,12695,Malaclemys terrapin,Vulnerable,A4acde,2019,2018-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>                 <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>&#160;is assessed as Vulnerable due to observed threats documented in the past and projected into the future with ≥35% population declines of monitored populations resulting from overexploitation, accidental mortality as bycatch in commercial Blue Crab fisheries, coastal habitat loss due to development, principally the loss of limited nesting habitat, in addition to extensive estuarine saltmarsh loss, and ongoing subsidized nest predation by mesopredators (threats reviewed in Roosenburg 2004; Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018; Chambers and Maerz 2018; Roosenburg and Kennedy 2018). Overall, it is our assessment that <em>M. terrapin</em> has sustained range-wide population declines over the last 30 years (two generations) of 25-30% and that the rate of decline is predicted to continue at the same rate for another 15 years (one generation), or about a 10-15% further decline, for a total decline over three generations (45 years) of 35-45%. The species therefore meets the criteria for Vulnerable designation under criteria A4acde. <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> was last assessed in 1996, when it was evaluated as Near Threatened.<br/><br/>Documenting population declines for a long-lived species like <em>M. terrapin</em> is challenging and requires intensive, long-term sampling (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 2001). Female terrapins become sexually mature at 4-13 years and longevity may exceed 50 years. Using an average estimated generation time of 15 years, it is reasonable to examine trends in the terrapin population for the past 30 years (two generations) and project 15 years (one generation) into the future. Subpopulations for which long-term data are available show significant declines, upwards to 75% decrease in population size over 20 years in the two populations with long term data in South Carolina (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007), Maryland (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and 55% decline in a New York population over 20 years (R.L. Burke, unpubl. data). Other populations have high mortality rates due to anthropogenic causes (Wood and Herlands 1997; Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006; Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018) and, in some cases, a change in population structure has been observed (Roosenburg <em>et al.</em> 1997; Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is not possible to determine range-wide population declines over specific time periods other than to rely on anecdotal evidence suggesting that terrapins are now rarely encountered in areas where they were once relatively common (Kennedy 2018a,b).</p><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p></span>","<p>                      </p><p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> is found in brackish coastal waters (salinity range = 0 to <a style=""mso-comment-reference: WMR_1;mso-comment-date:20161231T0810"">35</a>). Typical habitats include coastal regions, estuaries, lagoons, tidal creeks, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. In coastal estuaries supporting large watersheds, terrapins can occur far inland up to the terminal end of the salt wedge (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Hudson River, and Pamlico Sound). Although <em>M. terrapin</em> is found in brackish water, periodic access to freshwater is necessary for long-term health, and populations in high salinity habitats actively seek and drink freshwater which is essential for neonate survival and growth (Dunson 1985; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009) and may be a contributing factor to the semi-terrestrial behavior of neonates to 3-year-olds.&#160;Hatchlings are exceptionally desiccation tolerant (Figueras <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The diet of <em>M. terrapin</em> consists largely of invertebrates, crustaceans, and mollusks (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995, 2018) and a variety of plant materials and algae (Tulipani 2015; Erazmus <em>et al</em>. 2018). In some populations terrapins are predators of the Salt Marsh Periwinkle (<em>Littoraria irrorata</em>), a snail that grazes on epiphytes that grow on Salt Marsh Cord Grass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>). Silliman and Bertness (2002) demonstrated through a series of experiments that when periwinkle predators were removed, periwinkles damage and kill cord grass, leaving a barren mudflat and increasing marsh erosion rates. Although terrapins were not removed or tested in this experiment, as a periwinkle predator they are frequently identified as a potential saltmarsh keystone species. This extrapolation suggests that healthy terrapin populations play a role in maintaining primary production in salt marsh ecosystems and stabilizing shoreline vegetation, thus reducing local erosion.<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> exhibits considerable variation in size, sexual size dimorphism, and reproductive output throughout its range. In general, along the Atlantic sea board there is a gradient of increasing body size, greater sexual dimorphism, later ages of maturity, and higher reproductive output with increasing latitude (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gulf Coast populations do not conform to this latitudinal variation and are larger than their counterparts on the Atlantic Coast at the same latitude. Most comprehensive life history data come from long-term studies of populations in South Carolina, Maryland, and New York, with limited data from other parts of the range focused mostly on reproductive output and females. Nonetheless, the differences in morphological and life history traits contribute to different environmental stressors and management strategies relevant to terrapin populations throughout the range. Careful modeling is needed to compare reproductive traits among populations to assess how total annual reproductive output per individual varies along the latitudinal gradient.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins under natural conditions exhibit high adult survivorship, low reproductive rates, and high egg/juvenile mortality characteristic of most temperate turtles (Mitro 2003). As a consequence of this suite of life history traits, increases in adult mortality result in declining populations (Congdon <em>et al</em>. 1993, 1994). Marked variation in life history traits can be attributed to a broad latitudinal distribution (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Females from northern populations mature later and at a relatively larger size than those from southern populations. Clutch size and body size appear to be somewhat correlated over the range; females from New York average 12.8 eggs per clutch (Burke <em>et al</em>. 2018), Maryland females may produce as many as 26 eggs per clutch (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and smaller females from more southern populations produce only 4–6 eggs per clutch (Seigel 1984). Average annual reproductive output depends on the number of clutches produced per season. In Chesapeake Bay populations, the average female may produce 1–3 clutches of about 13 eggs in a single nesting season (13–40 eggs/year) and detailed nesting data suggest that terrapins rarely forgo nesting annually, but the number of clutches per year may vary (Roosenburg and Dunham 1997). For detailed reviews of reproductive data, see Roosenburg (1994), Butler <em>et al</em>. (2006a, 2006b), Brennessel (2006), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Lovich <em>et al</em>. (2018).<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> demonstrates marked sexual dimorphism, most likely as a fecundity advantage (Carr 1952), with females being considerably larger, with maximum reported population mean female carapace length of 20.1 cm and male carapace length of 13.3 cm (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Female terrapins can reach weights over 2.5 kg in northern populations, but males rarely exceed 0.5 kg throughout the range (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The maximum recorded size for an adult female, 32 cm carapace length, is much greater than that of males, 16 cm, from the same population, and the discrepancy between male and female size increases with latitude (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Female terrapins mature later and at a larger size than males. The resulting difference in body size is more pronounced in more northern populations. Size differences result in differences in jaw morphology and bite forces that likely contribute to resource partitioning (diet, habitat) between the sexes (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1999; Herrel <em>et al</em>. 2018). Throughout their geographic range, population means for hatchlings range from 25–38 mm in carapace length and 6.3–8.8 g in mass (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Maturity is reached at 4–13 years of age in females, and 2–7 years in males, depending on location (see summary in Brennessel 2006). Longevity may be greater than 40 years for some individuals; marked adult females have been recaptured 30 years after their initial capture as adults (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation time has not been reported in the published literature; available information indicates that it ranges from 13 to 20 years and also increases with increasing latitude (Mitro 2003; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation times in more southern populations are shorter, as maturity at lower latitudes is attained several years earlier (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Nesting requirements vary among subpopulations (Roosenburg 1994, Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> embryos have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), with females produced at higher incubation temperatures, generating&#160;important differences between populations (Jeyasuria <em>et al</em>. 1994; Burke and Calichio 2014). The challenges of climate change, combined with sea level rise and nesting habitat loss (Michener <em>et al</em>. 1997, Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017) could potentially affect sex ratios in populations. The conservation challenges associated with climate change and TSD as it affects sex ratios generates new concerns for the effective management of terrapin populations throughout their range, particularly when integrated with the nesting habitat loss due to development (Seigel and Gibbons 1995).<br/><br/>Terrapin hatchlings in northern parts of the range also facultatively overwinter in the nest, suggesting that the nesting environment is critical habitat throughout the entire year (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2018; Graham 2009; Kitson 2016). Post-emergence neonate habitat is poorly known, but after emergence, some hatchlings move to shallow, self-excavated hibernacula in upland areas (Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004, Duncan and Burke 2016) before moving into intertidal marshes where they may remain semi-terrestrial well into their second growing season (Muldoon and Burke 2012). Adult terrapins hibernate communally in depressions in the mud at the bottom of tidal creeks and embayments protected from prevailing weather (Haramis <em>et al</em>. 2011), in undercut banks within the tidal zone, or burrow into creek banks (Yearicks <em>et al</em>. 1981). Southern subspecies (e.g., <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>) may be active throughout the winter.</p><br/><p></p>","<p>                      </p><p>                     </p><p>Four main factors pose the most significant threats to <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> populations: 1) mortality of juveniles and adults in crab pots and mostly nesting females on roads, 2) loss of nesting and juvenile habitat to development and sea level rise, 3) the effect of subsidized predators at nesting beaches (Roosenburg 1991; Siegel and Gibbons 1995; Feinberg and Burke 2003; Woodland et al. 2017), and 4) loss of estuarine saltmarsh and mangrove habitats throughout their range (Kennish 2001; Ner and Burke 2008; Gedan <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In states with a commercial Blue Crab (<em>Callinectes sapidus</em>) fishery, which includes almost the terrapin’s entire range, incidental drowning in crab pots is considered to be the major threat to <em>M. terrapin</em> (Butler <em>et al</em>. 2006; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Terrapins, attracted to the bait, enter through an underwater opening, become trapped, and drown within a few hours (Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Small males and juveniles are caught more frequently than adult females due to the limitations on the size of the trap entrance. Wolak <em>et al</em>. (2010) suggested that high mortality in crab traps has led to selection on body size traits in a Chesapeake Bay population. Most studied populations where terrapins occurred with crab pots have skewed sex ratio biased toward females that have lower catch rates because of their larger size (Chambers and Maerz 2018).&#160;Crab pots remain the most prominent threat to terrapin populations and their ubiquitous use throughout the terrapin’s range and habitat hamper other conservation restoration efforts because the mortality caused by crab pots is so high.<br/><br/>Adult female terrapins are frequently struck and killed by motor vehicles while attempting to cross roads and motorways in search of nesting sites (Wood and Herlands 1997; Szerlag and McRobert 2006; Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011; Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018). Hatchling terrapins migrate to water after emerging from the nest and can get trapped in vehicular tire tracks left in the sand on nesting beaches. If the hatchlings are unable to escape, they may die of dehydration or be crushed by the next vehicle. Large female terrapins often bear scars from the propellers of motor boats; in the Chesapeake Bay region and in Jamaica Bay, New York, boat impacts are a significant source of mortality for this age class in areas with moderate to high boat traffic (Roosenburg 1991; R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Although most states now have legislation that regulates the collection of <em>M. terrapin</em> (Hackney 2010; Nanjappa and Conrad 2011; Kennedy 2018a), this species is still taken commercially in parts of Louisiana. Commercial interest in terrapins remains high, primarily for trade and consumption in Asia or to Asian communities in North America. Hatchlings sell in pet markets of Hong Kong for $50-500 each depending on colouration (T. Leuteritz, pers. comm.). In 2006, the last year in which terrapins were legally harvested in Maryland, watermen reported a catch of 10,500 pounds of terrapins. Additionally, harvest of terrapins for turtle farms in the US and Asia is taxing wild populations and contributing to potential illegal harvest in states where they are currently protected. One such event resulted in the offtake of more than 3,000 females from a single population in New Jersey. Serendipitously, this event resulted in the closure of the commercial terrapin harvest in New Jersey.<br/><br/>One of the terrapin subspecies, <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>, is considered endemic and endangered in its restricted range in southern Florida. Unless examined by expert terrapin biologists familiar with all the subspecies, <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em> could easily be traded unnoticed because of its similarity to the other subspecies. Similar to endangered map turtles, genus <em>Graptemys</em>, some of which also can only be recognized by experts, the trade of endangered terrapin subspecies is facilitated by the trade of the species in general. Furthermore, several states throughout the range have provided protected status to terrapins or restricted trade and harvest. These terrapins cannot be distinguished from terrapins that were collected from areas where they were legally harvested or from farm-produced individuals.<br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses a serious and ongoing threat to the species. The Diamondback Terrapin’s range is coincident with areas of dense human population (Ner and Burke 2008), and &gt;50% of original estuarine saltmarsh habitat in terrapin range has been lost over the last century (Kennish 2001). Coastal development, particularly salt marsh draining and shoreline armoring for residential or agricultural purposes, increased use of coastal waterways for commercial and recreational purposes, and loss of sand dunes (important nesting habitat) contribute to habitat loss and degradation which negatively affects terrapins (Isdell <em>et al</em>. 2015). Coastal development is particularly problematic because it frequently destroys nesting beaches (Roosenburg 1991; Roosenburg and Place 1995). Three consequences of development for terrapins are: 1) higher concentration of nesting habitat in remaining areas resulting in greater predation rates of nests, 2) alteration of incubation conditions potentially affecting survivorship and gender because of temperature-dependent sex determination, and 3) increased predation on adult females. Additionally, sea level rise due to climate change may have a severe impact on diamondback terrapin habitat including loss of nesting habitat, but more seriously the elimination of critical juvenile salt marsh habitat. Recent GIS modeling based on predicted sea level rise suggests substantial habitat loss during the next 50-100 years in Chesapeake Bay (Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Human-subsidized predators (i.e., native or introduced animals whose populations prosper as a result of association with humans and human-altered habitats) are another threat to turtle populations (Boarman 1997). Studies across the range have identified (locally introduced) Raccoons (<em>Procyon lotor</em>), Skunks (<em>Mephitis mephitis</em>), Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), feral Hogs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), and non-native Norway Rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) as major predators on the adults, juveniles, and eggs of <em>M. terrapin</em>, accounting for a nest predation rate of 92%, and emerging hatchling predation rate of up to 20% (Feinberg and Burke 2003; Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004; Muldoon and Burke 2012; Buzuleciu <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Finally, the impacts of various pollutants in heavily urbanized estuarine environments jeopardize terrapin populations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals and various insecticides and herbicides all potentially affect terrapins (Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2018). Many of these compounds have been discovered in terrapins and have been demonstrated to have deleterious effects on development, growth, and survival (Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009; Holliday and Holliday 2011; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Microplastics, which are both pollutants themselves and synergists with other pollutants, were found in the feces of eight of eight terrapins tested in Jamaica Bay, New York (R.L. Burke, unpubl. data).</p><p></p>","<p>In the early 1900s, populations of <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> were in danger of extinction due to intense commercial harvest for human consumption (Hay 1917). Although pre-harvest population data are lacking, many populations had recovered to some extent by the late 20th century and <em>M. terrapin</em> was listed as Lower Risk/Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List in 1996 (Kennedy 2018b). However, data from long-term studies (Avissar 2006; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Roosenburg 2004; Wood and Herlands 1997) suggest that many terrapin populations are again in decline. Effects that contribute to observed declines in well-studied subpopulations (ongoing habitat loss/degradation, crab pot mortality, subsidized nest predation, and road mortality) are ubiquitous and likely to have a similar effect throughout the terrapin’s range (Seigel and Gibbons 1995). Low recruitment due to high nest predation, juvenile and adult male mortality in crab pots and high adult female mortality from vehicle collisions and crab pots in southern populations are cause for alarm because population models suggest a stable population requires both modest recruitment and, most importantly, high adult survival (Roosenburg 2004; Mitro 2003).<br/><br/>In Kiawah, South Carolina, population estimates from a mark-recapture study of <em>M. terrapin</em><span class=""datalabel1""> suggest a decline of 75% over the last two decades (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). High male and juvenile mortality rates in this population, likely due to incidental drowning in crab pots, result in an increase in the proportion of large females in the population (Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). Similarly, crab pots have been suggested to cause female biased sex ratios (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) and potentially driving the evolution of male body size (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010) in Chesapeake Bay. Similar levels of decline have been observed in the adult female population during a 20 year population study in the Patuxent River of Chesapeake Bay. Factors contributing to the decline in the Patuxent population include commercial harvest, bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries, an oil spill, and nesting habitat loss (W.M. Roosenburg, <span class=""datalabel1"">unpubl<span class=""datalabel1"">.<span class=""datalabel1""> data<span class=""datalabel1"">).<br/><br/>Commercial and recreational use of crab pots continues to be the major contributing factor to the population declines from New Jersey to Texas (Bishop 1983; Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Seigel and Gibbons 1994; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Populations in Chesapeake Bay have female biased sex ratios due to the impact of crab pots (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) in addition to compensatory growth and changed size structure as a consequence of continued crab pot mortality (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent work has suggested that even a single crab pot in a tidal creek or local area can drive population declines (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In estuaries near Tuckerton,&#160;New Jersey, road mortality contributed to a significant decline in the number of adult females over 13 years (Avissar 2006). This demographic shift was not attributed to crab pot mortality because the site is closed to crabbing; however, a decline in large females is consistent with the observation that road mortality of nesting females had increased (Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006). A long-term study on the Cape May Peninsula of southernmost New Jersey documented 4,020 road kills during a 7-year period (Wood and Herlands 1997). As of 2011, the total number of roadkills at this study site has surpassed 10,000 adult females (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data). The terrapin population decline during this time is unknown, but is likely substantial because the area also has a significant commercial and recreational crab fishery (Wood 1997). Similarly in Georgia, small tidal creeks impacted by commercial crabbing and nearby roads had reduced terrapin populations relative to creeks more isolated from these threats (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>New York’s largest terrapin populations inhabit the heavily-urbanized Jamaica Bay. Researchers observed over 2,000 nests on one island in this study area in 1998 (Feinberg and Burke 2003). Recruitment is low because annual nest predation rates, primarily by raccoons, vary from 92-100%. The number of nests laid per year declined 43% from 1999-2011 (Feinberg and Burke 2003; R.L. Burke, unpubl. data) and the nesting terrapin population has experienced a 55% decline from 1998 to 2017 (R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Little is known about terrapin populations along the Gulf Coast. Historical accounts suggest large populations once existed in this part of the range, but overexploitation has reduced populations which are slow to recover in the face of heavy crabbing pressure (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Dauphine Island, Alabama, formerly supported a significant terrapin fishery which currently remains as a relic population (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Recent studies in Louisiana have discovered subpopulations in the Rockefeller National Wildlife Refuge and its adjoining bayous and in Barataria Bay, but detailed population and life history data are lacking from this area (Selman <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pearson and Wiebe 2018). Small populations are also known from Galveston Bay, Texas, but the combination of development and pollution has reduced the available habitat to a few small islands within the bay (V. Guillory, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bermuda’s terrapin population is estimated at about 100 individuals and recruitment is low, caused by low nest success (Outerbridge 2014). The reasons for developmental failure are not known, but could be due to insecticides and herbicides used around the only wetland where terrapins are found (M.E. Outerbridge, pers. comm.).</span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Malaclemys terrapin </em>inhabits the estuarine coastal waters of the United States along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Corpus Christi, Texas (Iverson 1992; TTWG 2017). A breeding subpopulation also is found in the Bermuda Islands (Davenport et al. 2005), which was considered native by Parham <em>et al</em>. (2008) and genetically attributed to subspecies <em>M. t. centrata</em>. The human role in the origin of the Bermuda subpopulation remains under consideration (Lovich and Hart 2018), but it currently is an established and protected population (Outerbridge 2014).<br/><br/>Subspecific distributional information for the morphologically-defined historically recognized subspecies is as follows (noting, however, that molecular phylogeography does not agree with this pattern, but that a revised taxonomy has not yet been formulated; see Taxonomy section):<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin terrapin</em>: from Cape Cod, Massachusetts southward to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin centrata</em>.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin centrata</em>: from the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward to northern peninsular Florida, where it meets and intergrades with <em>M. terrapin tequesta</em>; also on Bermuda.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin tequesta</em>: Atlantic east coast of peninsular Florida to Biscayne Bay, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em>.</p>  <p><em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em>: Florida Keys westward to the Marquesas Keys.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin macrospilota</em>: Gulf coast of peninsular Florida, intergrading with <em>M. terrapin pileata</em> in the panhandle and with <em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em> in Florida Bay.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin pileata</em>: from the Florida panhandle, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin macrospilota, </em>to<em> </em>Louisiana, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin littoralis</em>.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin littoralis</em>: western Louisiana and the coast of Texas, at least as far south as Corpus Christi Bay.<br/><br/>Anecdotal reports that this species is found in Mexican waters (e.g., Carr 1952) have been disputed (Smith and Smith 1979); there is no credible information indicating occurrence in Mexico (Iverson 1992; Mexican Red List Workshop participants, Sept. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Range Size:</strong>&#160;The presence of a coastal species like <em>M. terrapin</em> is difficult to determine because of their cryptic nature and the inaccessibility of much of their habitat. Its distribution is discontinuous along the ~5,000 km of coastline between Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Corpus Christi, Texas. However, it is unknown if the discontinuity can be attributed to natural biological boundaries or to barriers created by extensive urbanization and industrial development in portions of its coastal habitat. Terrapins inhabit salt marshes that form on the bay side of barrier islands, and the extent to which they move inland via estuaries varies considerably, but seems to be bounded by waters that are brackish for most of the year.&#160; Nonetheless, terrapin habitat, salt marsh juvenile habitat, and nesting areas, have all diminished greatly because of salt marsh loss and the development of coastal and estuarine waterfront (Kennish 2001; Ner and Burke 2008). No range-wide population estimate is available, but data are consistent in that subpopulations are local, sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation, and many individually studied subpopulations are small, while others are more robust (summarized in Roosenburg and Kennedy 2018).</p>","<p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>&#160;was utilized for food prior to European settlement in North America; however, as human populations increased throughout the terrapin’s range and terrapin consumption became fashionable, the exploitation reached unsustainable levels. By the late 19th century native populations were in dramatic decline, warranting the first federal attempts to farm terrapins (Kennedy 2018a). Captive propagation for commercial purposes was initiated in the early 20th century because of range-wide population declines and danger of extinction, indicating that fisheries of wild populations were not sustainable (Hay 1917). Extensive data are available for artificial propagation of terrapins for commercial purposes (Hay 1917; Coker 1920; Hildebrand and Hatsel 1926; Hildebrand 1932) but the general consensus of these studies was that it is not economically feasible to farm terrapins as a food source because of slow growth rates. The demand for terrapin meat eventually decreased and the depleted populations began to slowly recover after 1930 (Carr 1952). In the early 2000s increases in the commercial capture and trade of terrapins were identified (USDA 2011). Most of the captured turtles were shipped to Asian communities in major metropolitan areas in the US and also exported to Asia. This increase in demand alarmed turtle biologists and prompted many states to increase regulations, protection, and monitoring of terrapin populations (Kennedy 2018a). The primary concern with the resurgence of the commercial terrapin fishery is that, combined with habitat degradation, recovery will be slower, if not impossible. Export data for terrapins in 1999-2010 indicate an increase in the number of individuals and shipments, primarily as exports to Asia (USDA 2011). Concern about the increases in terrapin export has resulted in the closure of the remaining commercial wild harvest in all states except Louisiana. Maryland closed their commercial fishery, based primarily on the export to China and declining populations in Chesapeake Bay (Roosenburg <em>et al.</em> 2008). Following the closure of the Maryland fishery exports dropped by approximately 25% from their peak and most exports at this time are believed to originate from farms, although this has not been confirmed. Today, Louisiana remains the only state where terrapins can be harvested from the wild for commercial sale. Many states maintain a subsistence harvest of two per day for either consumption or pets.<br/><br/>Terrapins are currently bred in captivity (turtle farms) on a small scale in the United States and the hatchlings are sold commercially for the pet trade and to supply aquaculture rearing facilities in Asia that eventually supply the consumption trade and maintain reproductive colonies for the pet trade. Recent exports of high numbers of terrapin hatchlings originating from the single commercial turtle farm in Maryland revealed that successful terrapin farming requires a constant infusion of wild brood stock. The adults that produced most of the hatchlings sold were obtained from New Jersey in a manner that was disputably legal or illegal; New Jersey subsequently closed its commercial terrapin fishery (T. Leuteritz, pers. comm.).</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>Diamondback Terrapins are protected from commercial exploitation in most states where they occur, but as of early 2018 commercial harvests remain permitted under regulations in Louisiana (Kennedy, 2018a). Personal possession is permitted under certain conditions in most states (Nanjappa and Conrad 2011; Kennedy, 2018a) but restricted in most cases to no more than two individuals and permits required for possession as pets. <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> was included in CITES Appendix II in 2013, making its international trade subject to determinations and evaluation that traded volumes are not detrimental to the survival of wild populations.<br/><br/>Hackney (2010) used the standardized Natural Heritage Program to compare the conservation status of terrapins among range states. Of the 16 range states, one (Rhode Island) lists the species as S1, or critically imperiled. Four states list the species as S2, imperiled, while six states list it as S3, vulnerable. Four states consider the diamondback terrapin to be S4, apparently secure. South Carolina has not ranked terrapins according to this scale. State protective listing or harvest regulation in all range states is recommended. In Bermuda, diamondback terrapins have level 2 protection under the Protected Species Order 2012.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins reside in coastal habitats that are intensively used and modified by humans (Kennish 2001, Ner and Burke 2008, Gedan <em>et al</em>. 2009). Safeguarding areas of optimal habitat, particularly foraging, nesting and hibernation sites, from development and other modification is essential for the long-term survival of this species. Terrapins occur in a substantial number of protected areas and their movement is limited (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mortality in crab pots and habitat fragmentation are suggested to reduce gene flow while signatures of the past commercial trade and movement of terrapins are still detectable in some populations (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2017, Converse and Kuchta, 2018). Terrapins use a variety of estuarine habitats throughout their range and local populations effectively exploit their native habitat. Populations can grow and respond quickly when provided with predator-free nesting areas, high quality juvenile habitat, and protection of adults, in particular reproductive females (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.L. Burke, unpubl. data), suggesting that estuarine or marine preserves combined with nest predator control can provide an effective tool to restore terrapin populations in areas where numbers are reduced (Roosenburg 2018).<br/><br/>Bycatch reduction devices (BRD) can greatly reduce the number of terrapins that drown in crab traps (Wood 1997; Hoyle and Gibbons 2000; Roosenburg and Green 2000; Butler and Heinrich 2007). By installing BRDs in crab pots, most adult female terrapins are excluded, particular in mid-Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, and the Gulf coast regions where body sizes are larger. BRDs are also effective in southern Atlantic regions and Florida and perhaps more important because adult females never outgrow the vulnerability to crab pots without BRDs (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011). Several states now require BRDs; however, regulations vary considerably across the terrapin’s range (Hackney 2010), as does the intensity of enforcement of regulations. Broad adoption of BRDs will significantly assist the species' prospects (Guillory and Prejean 1998; Rook <em>et al</em>. 2010; Radzio <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Perhaps the greatest concern for terrapins is entrapment in derelict or ghost crab pots that are not regularly checked. Several cases have been recorded where &gt;20 individuals have been recovered dead from crab pots that were abandoned, one with more than 100 individuals (Bishop 1983; Roosenburg 1991; Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>                     </p><p>Since 2003, research scientists and summer interns at The Wetlands Institute in New Jersey have deployed barrier fencing to reduce road mortality in their study area. Results to date suggest that barrier fencing can be an effective terrapin conservation tool (McLaughlin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, at JFK Airport in New York, personnel successfully use barrier fencing to keep terrapins off runways (Burke and Francoeur 2014). Combined with nesting habitat improvement adjacent to roadways, fencing can dramatically reduce roadway mortality and help direct terrapins to protected nesting sites (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018). Finally, roadway warning signals activated at times of peak nesting in high use areas can dramatically reduce nesting female road mortality. Impacts by watercraft also present a problem for terrapins in areas with high boat traffic (Roosenburg 1991; Lester <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, terrapins appear not to respond to the noise of approaching vessels, increasing the risk of boat impact; thus suggesting that marine speed limits near areas of terrapin congregation (e.g., nesting beaches) would be the only effective mechanism to reduce boat strikes (Lester <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018).<br/><br/>Nest protection and head-starting programs exist at a variety of locations, and are subject to active research on their effective contribution to population dynamics and establishment success (Herlands <em>et al</em>. 2004; Smeenk 2010; Petrov 2014; Roosenburg 2018). High nest predation remains a key conservation problem for terrapins and control of mammalian nest predators increases nest success (Munscher <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the complete absence of nest predators can contribute to population recovery (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). Head-starting can supplement population growth and head-started individuals can establish within native populations. Furthermore, head-started females can become reproductive and some remain in the local population where they were released (Roosenburg 2018). However, the low level of gene flow among populations (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2015) suggests that source animals should only come from the same population they will supplement or from the nearest population for extirpated areas.<br/><br/>One example of effective terrapin conservation and restoration is the Paul S. Sarbanes Environmental Restoration Project at Poplar Island, Chesapeake Bay, Maryland (Roosenburg et al. 2014, Roosenburg 2018). Poplar Island’s restoration has established predator-free nesting habitat and extensive salt marsh habitat for juveniles. There also is an active head-starting program on Poplar Island. The terrapin population on Poplar Island is growing rapidly due primarily to the high nest survival (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014) and high quality juvenile habitat that ensures high post-hatching juvenile survivorship (Roosenburg 2018). Although head-starting does contribute to population growth, its impacts are secondary to that of the habitat creation and protection (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The Poplar Island example illustrates the basic requirements for population recovery which suggests that estuarine reserves or sanctuaries that include both nesting and juvenile habitat, combined with nest predator control, offer an excellent strategy for terrapin population recovery.<br/><br/>Further research on terrapin conservation is needed, particularly towards understanding individual and seasonal movement patterns, habitat use at different life stages, and refinement of the taxonomy. Although some populations and areas are well studied, other parts of the range have less data, particularly the Gulf Coast and the populations within Pamlico Sound and the estuarine waters of North Carolina, and southern New England. Most states have some form of ongoing terrapin research, but the expansive range and the need for boats to access key habitats limits both surveys and detailed population studies. Recent work also has suggested that climate change will dramatically affect habitat availability for terrapins, particularly the juvenile dependence on saltmarsh habitat, which is predicted to decline dramatically due to sea level rise (Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further study of the effects of sea level rise is needed to evaluate how habitat and resources will be affected.<br/><br/>Although these conservation targets have been known for years, declines in terrapin populations have not been fully addressed for a variety of issues. Conservation measures, such as establishing requirements for bycatch reduction devices in crab pots, have often been effectively resisted by commercial fishermen through political lobbying efforts. Furthermore, even with regulations in place, lack of compliance and enforcement results in ineffective use rates (Radzio <em>et al</em>. 2014). Finally, conflicts between the preservation of nesting habitat shoreline and the development and protection of high-value coastal real estate seem to preempt terrapin conservation measures. Despite the slow pace of terrapin conservation, some progress has been made to reduce road mortality in some areas (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b) and population recovery and growth have been observed in at least one population (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). Additionally, the technology to reduce terrapin capture in crab pots has made substantial progress (Roosenburg 2004, Chambers and Maerz 2018) as range-wide fine-tuning of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) continues (Schwenter and Arndt, unpubl. data).</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

In some caves where the species is found in the state of Yucatan, the water is accessible without diving, which makes this fish prone to pollution from garbage and organic matter from visitors.

In addition, some of its locations, especially in the state&#160;of Yucatan, are affected by solid waste and other sources of pollution from tourist visitors. In addition, water extraction for urban use or pig farms not only threatens to dry out some localities, but can also prompt the intrusion of saline water into the aquifer (Ceballos <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;As with the other endemic hypogean freshwater fish species from the region, such as&#160;<em>T. pearsei</em>, the main threats to <em>O. infernale</em>&#160;and its habitat include water pollution (resulting from inadequate sewage treatment and wastewater disposal), increased groundwater extraction and decreased aquifer recharge (both exacerbated by the tremendous growth of the tourism industry in the region), and saltwater intrusion (Kane 2016, Deng<em> et al.</em> 2017, Saint-Loup <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The population seems to be low, but stable, in locations in Quintana Roo but not in Yucatan localities (which are the majority), where at least one has been destroyed.

Generation time is not known, but by analogy with other large softshells it will not be less than a decade. Quantitative data are not available, but an estimate that most populations have halved, and the fact that several populations have disappeared completely, indicates that the species has had a population size reduction of at least 80% over three generations (30 years), and that this decline is continuing. The species therefore qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered (CR A2cd +4cd).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p><em>Pelochelys cantorii</em> inhabits large lowland rivers, lakes, reservoirs and estuarine areas including mangrove channels and coastal mudflats near river mouths (Moll 1985, Das 1991, Thirakhupt and van Dijk, 1995, Choudhury<em> et al.</em> 2000). It nests on riverbanks and sea beaches (Moll 1985, Das 1991).<br/><br/><em>Pelochelys cantorii</em> feeds on a variety of animal prey, mainly fish and crustaceans. It's flattened head and widely spaced eyes suggest that this species is an ambush feeder, with striking behaviour being observed in captive specimens (Das 2008).<br/><br/>Maximum size not known in detail; usually stated to reach 100–180 cm carapace length, but most reports of very large <em>P. cantorii</em> have proved to be based on misidentified <em>Chitra</em> and <em>Rafetus</em>. The largest vouchered specimens from Thailand are about 60 cm carapace length.<br/><br/>Age and size at maturity have not been recorded. Females produce clutches of 24–28 eggs (Moll 1985); but has been reported as 40–701 in the Ouijan River in China (Gu <em>et al</em>. 2000), multiple clutching is possible but not confirmed. Zhao and Li (2017) report that clutches are over ten eggs, with a maximum 100 per clutch. Generation length is a minimum of ten years.</p>","<p><em>Pelochelys cantorii </em>is widely consumed whenever encountered throughout its range (Moll 1985, Humphrey and Bain 1990, Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). More recently it has also appeared in the Calipee trade (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).&#160; It is rarely seen in markets in Malaysia, Thailand, India or elsewhere. Nest poaching has also been noted (Choudhury <em>et al. </em>2000).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation and loss are probably particularly acute for this species, with lower river basins and estuarine areas particularly heavily impacted by human settlement, cities, harbours, ports and industrial development, and nesting sites impacted by sand removal, development and tourism. Entanglement in fishing nets and water pollution are further threats. Small numbers of captive-bred juveniles occur in the global pet trade.</p>","<p>Historically <em>Pelochelys cantorii </em>may have been locally common (Cantor 1848, Straits of Malacca), but in recent decades is usually described as “widespread but nowhere abundant” (Moll 1985).<br/><br/>In Bangladesh <em>P. cantorii </em>is considered Critically Endangered, with very few animals seen any longer (P.

It is now considered Critically Endangered on the China National Red List. Records of the occurrence on the mainland of southern China are complicated by confusion with <em>Rafetus swinhoei</em>.<br/><br/>In India, Das (1991) noted the species as not uncommon in Orissa, but had been practically eliminated by 2000 (Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). Participants at the 2005 Lucknow Red List Workshop agreed that the species was nearly extinct in southern India, and Critically Endangered and headed for extinction in India overall. Very few specimens have been found on surveys or in markets in recent years (Participants Singapore Red List Workshop 2011). Very few specimens have been found in recent years.<br/><br/>In Thailand, populations have disappeared from the Mae Klong and Chao Phraya river basins, and the species is restricted to remnant populations in the Peninsula (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995), where its situation appears relatively stable (Kitimasak pers. comm. at Singapore Red List Workshop 2011). There are now no known nesting sites in Viet Nam (B. Horne pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Very few animals have been seen in trade in Viet Nam since monitoring started in the 1990s (T. McCormack pers. comm. at Singapore Red List Workshop 2011).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, the species is considered very rare, with very few individuals reported in 2017. Three individuals have been found in Aceh in 2017 (J. Guntoro pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>No reliable data exists for this species in Malaysia, a few specimens are still found (Chan pers. comm. at Singapore Red List Workshop 2011). No data exists for this species in Myanmar. There are no recent records from Singapore or Brunei Darussalam. Occurrence in the Philippines is vouchered by very few specimens over the past 150 years (Taylor 1921).<br/><br/>Over its entire range the population of <em>P. cantorii</em> is suspected to have reduced by at least 80% in the last three generations (30 years), and this decline is predicted to continue.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pelochelys cantorii</em> is widespread, with localised occurrences in lowland rivers and estuaries from southern and eastern India and Bangladesh. through Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia (Peninsula, Sarawak, Sabah), Singapore (extinct), Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, southern China, the Philippines (where widespread), and Indonesia (Sumatra, Kalimantan) (Iverson 1992, Das 1995, Webb 1995).

Molluscs account for 75% of the diet of larger individuals (&gt; 20 cm), crustaceans for about 20%, and fishes for about 5%. This species feeds on the economically important octopus <em>Octopus vulgaris</em> and cuttlefish <em>Sepia officinalis.&#160;</em>With increased size, this species shifts its habitat to seagrass beds, which are likely to be its spawning grounds. The largest individuals (&gt;75 cm) have been captured over rocky bottoms, indicating further habitat shift to deeper or rocky grounds (Kalogirou 2013).<em> Lagocephalus sceleratus</em> is considered invasive in the Mediterranean Basin due to its isometric growth, early age of first reproduction (two years), highly adaptive feeding behaviour, intelligence, and absence of competitors (EastMed 2010).</p><p>The maximum standard length (SL) of <em>L. sceleratus</em> is 110 cm male/unsexed (Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984), however it is more common total length is 40.0 cm, male/unsexed (Bouhlel 1988).

As such the species is close to qualifying for a threatened listing applying criteria B1, B2 and C2ai.","<p>This small diurnal skink mostly inhabits coastal rocky regions, often associated with boulder piles and structured bedrock, with fissures, cavities and tussocks of the native grass <em>Zoysia tenuifolia</em>. Animals are mostly active at the hottest times of day when there is little or no cloud cover and quickly take refuge within crevices or under rocks or other debris when disturbed. Their grey to brown dorsal colour sometimes tinged with green or blue (Cole 2009) makes them well-camouflaged against their rocky habitat. They feed mostly upon small invertebrates, particularly small moths, cockroaches, flies and crickets (Bullock 1986, N. Cole pers. obs.). They are often found along the shore within the splash zone and close to rock pools, and have been observed to predate small crustaceans and fish (Cole 2009). In the absence of competitors and predators the skink can be found more inland, usually in rocky and sparsely vegetated habitats, although they will occasionally climb the branches of small native shrubs<em> Pemphis acidula</em>, <em>Suriana maritima</em> and <em>Tournefortia arguta</em>. It has been noted that the Bojer’s Skink, whose microhabitat use overlaps with the Bouton’s Skink (Bullock 1986), is a potential competitor and restricts Bouton’s Skink to the coastal fringes of islets that they both occupy (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bullock 1986, Jones 1993). The ability of the Bojer’s Skink to exclude Bouton’s Skink from all but coastal rocky habitats has been observed on islets where the Bojer’s Skink has been re-introduced (N. Cole unpublished data), but it does not completely exclude Bouton's Skink.<br/><br/>It has an elongated body and slender legs has a snout to vent length up to 48.1 mm with a total body length up to 103.5 mm (N. Cole unpublished data). It lays two eggs (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cole 2009) with hatchlings seen from December to May (N. Cole pers. obs.).&#160;</p>","Introduced predators, such as rats <em>Rattus norvegicus </em>and <em>R. rattus</em>, mongooses (<em>Herpestes javanicus</em>), cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), musk shrews (<em>Suncus murinus</em>), myna birds (<em>Acridotheres tristis</em>), red-whiskered bulbuls (<em>Pycnonotus jocosus</em>), agamid lizards (<em>Calotes versicolor</em>), common house geckos (<em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em>) and Indian Wolf Snakes (<em>Lycodon aulicus</em>), have either been observed predating upon Bouton’s Skinks or have been implicated in their historical decline (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Jones 1993, Honsterette and Probst 1999, Cole 2005, N. Cole pers. obs.). Some of the subpopulations continue to persist in the presence of these predators and so the actual cause of historical decline is unknown. Littering and marine debris have led to skinks becoming entrapped, and dumping of hot oil and charcoal from barbecues onto coastal rocks have led to Bouton’s Skink mortality (N. Cole pers. obs.), although the extent of these impacts is unknown. Given the restricted range of the skink and presence along coastal fringes, coastal development causing the destruction of rocky habitats and the influx of invasive predators, inappropriate disposal of waste materials, littering and marine debris, sea level rise, storm surges and cyclones represent threats to the species.","<p>Monitoring of the Mauritian subpopulations on a few of the islets and periodic visits to the mainland sites indicate that overall they are stable (N. Cole unpublished data). Reintroductions of the Bojer’s Skink from Ilot Vacoas to Ile aux Fouquets and Ile de la Passe has led to predicted declines in the abundance of Bouton’s Skinks, but they persist in the presence of Bojer’s Skinks, as they do on other islets they co-occupy (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2013, N. Cole unpublished data). The average density of Bouton’s Skinks on Gunner’s Quoin from annual distance sampling surveys along 17 line transects within their restricted range, between 2006 and 2019, is 222.8 (95% confidence intervals: 182.6–271.8) individuals per hectare (N. Cole unpublished data). Gunner’s Quoin maintains the largest population size of approximately 2,674 (2,192–3,262) individuals, followed by Round Island that supports approximately 796 (42–1,550) individuals (Cole <em>et al.</em> 2018, N. Cole unpublished data). All other subpopulations sizes number in the few hundreds or less and the global adult population size is considered to be less than ten thousand.</p>",Stable,"&#160;This species is endemic to Mauritius and Réunion (Horner 2007). In Mauritius, the skink is found in four tiny and isolated coastal subpopulations in the North (Cap Malheureux) and East (Pointe Lafayette, Long Beach and Palmar) on the main island (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Jones 1993, Cole 2009, N. Cole unpublished data). It was recorded sometime around the 1830s among inland rock piles within the Flacq District to the East of Mauritius (Desjardin 1831), but it has never since been rediscovered here (Vinson and Vinson, 1969, Jones 1993, N. Cole pers. obs.). The species was also recorded in the late 1860s at Tamarind Bay in the island's southwest and were described as being abundant around much of the coastline of Mauritius (Pike 1873), which is not the case today. Residents of Mahebourg in the southeast describe seeing small and fast lizards that ran across the ground and rocks on the coastline of Ile aux Aigrettes (0.26 km<sup>2</sup>) until the 1950s–60s (M. Goder pers. comm. in Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009). This description is consistent with a <em>Cryptoblepharus</em>&#160;species, but could have referred to Bojer’s skink<em> Gongylomorphus bojeri</em> (although this species is not known from Isle aux Aigrettes) (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The skink is also restricted to the coastal areas on five northern islets (Round Island - 2.19 km<sup>2</sup>, Flat Island - 2.53 km<sup>2</sup>, Gabriel Island - 0.42 km<sup>2</sup>, Gunner’s Quoin - 0.70 km<sup>2</sup> and Ilot Bernache - 5.28 km<sup>2</sup>) and three south-eastern islets (Ile aux Fouquets - 0.03 km<sup>2</sup>, Ilot Vacoas - 0.01 km<sup>2</sup> and Ile de la Passe - 0.02 km<sup>2</sup>) in Mauritius (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Tonge 1990, Jones 1993, Cole 2009, N. Cole pers. obs.). Whilst all the islets and much of the coastline of Mauritius have been searched specifically for Bouton’s Skinks, the Palmar population described by Vinson and Vinson (1969) was not rediscovered until 2018, despite multiple searches of the 0.002 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;rock from 2002 (N. Cole unpublished data). Similarly, the Long Beach population was not known, until its discovery in 2019 (N. Cole unpublished data; as such it is possible that additional undetected subpopulations survive.<br/><br/>In Réunion a subpopulation was discovered in 1999, restricted to a cliff face in the South of the island close to Petite Ile (Maillard 1863, Honsterette and Probst 1999). Few animals were seen at the time and only one collected (Honsterette and Probst 1999). This represented the only report of this species on Réunion since the 1860s, and the species has not since been detected on Réunion have not since been detected despite intensive surveys in 2009 (Sanchez <em>et al</em>. 2010), 2010 (M. Sanchez and J.M. Probst unpublished data) and 2013 (M. Sanchez, J.M. Probst, S. Caceres, and C. Raxworthy unpublished data). Similarly, the population on Ile aux Fous (0.002 km<sup>2</sup>) in Mauritius, has not been detected since it was discovered in 1987 (Jones 1993), despite three visits to the small rock between 2006 and 2010 (N. Cole unpublished data). As neither the Réunion nor the Ile aux Fous populations can be confirmed to exist, they are not included as extant subpopulations in this assessment and the Réunion subpopulation is currently considered extinct, although the recent discoveries of long-overlooked subpopulations on small Mauritian islands despite repeated surveys, it remains possible the species survives on both Réunion and Ile aux Fous but at densities too low to reliably detect.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for the species is 741 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy derived from 2x2 km<sup>2</sup> grid cells is 56 km<sup>2</sup> (GeoCat). The actual area occupied is considerably smaller, with the combined range of all the subpopulations on the main island and the offshore islets of Mauritius being 0.42 km<sup>2</sup> (N. Cole unpublished data).

Banos del Azufre and La Gloria contain 17.7 km<sup>2</sup> and 2.2 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat, respectively. Estimated population densities and an inferred effective population size suggest that this species is abundant where it occurs. Populations are not severely fragmented. However, several localized stressors at Banos del Azufre have resulted in or are expected to result in a decline in the area, extent, and quality of available habitat. The La Gloria subpopulation is likely stable, given it is not impacted by any known major threats.

Many of the springheads have been converted into bathing pools and are used for recreational purposes (Tobler<em> et al.</em> 2008, Tobler and Plath 2009). Use of adjacent land in cattle grazing has significantly altered the riparian buffer zone and spring outflow (Tobler and Plath 2009, Culumber <em>et al.</em> 2016). Agricultural runoff from surrounding sugar cane and palm oil plantations may pose additional threats (Culumber <em>et al.</em> 2016, Brown<em> et al. </em>2017).

1820234,186911,Mimagoniates lateralis,Near Threatened,B2b(iii),2021,2018-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,Portuguese,"<em>Mimagoniates lateralis </em>ocorre nos riachos e alagadiços de águas ácidas e pretas, nas regiões litorâneas de Mata Atlântica e restinga entre o sul do estado de São Paulo (Itanhaém) e o norte do estado de Santa Catarina (Araquari). É uma espécie abundante, porém pouco frequente, típica de um biótopo específico, dependente da vegetação ripária para manter subpopulações viáveis. A extensão de ocorrência (EOO) da espécie, calculada pelo método do mínimo polígono convexo, é de cerca de 17.000 km<sup>2</sup>. Seus ambientes preferenciais são bastante sensíveis à degradação ambiental e altamente impactados e fragmentados pela expansão imobiliária litorânea. Desse modo, <em>M. lateralis </em>foi categorizada como Quase Ameaçada (NT).","Pouco se sabe sobre a ecologia dessa espécie, mas a orientação superior de sua boca e informações obtidas de outras espécies do gênero, bem como de alguns poucos conteúdos estomacais analisados, sugerem que a alimentação seja principalmente baseada em insetos terrestres. Otto (2006) analisando 468 indivíduos de <em>M. lateralis</em> verificou que os estômagos vazios representaram 1,28%, correspondente a 6 indivíduos. O item com maior representatividade foi Arthropoda (artrópodes não identificados), representando cerca de 50% do total de itens ingeridos, seguido de formas adultas de Diptera e Coleoptera. Essa autora detectou a presença do item Decapoda, que pode indicar um possível forrageamento próximo ao fundo, o que não é usual para outras espécies do gênero <em>Mimagoniates</em>. Ocorre principalmente em córregos e alagadiços florestais das planícies litorâneas, de águas avermelhadas e de fluxo lento. Parâmetros físico-químicos coletados em riachos habitados pela espécie na ilha de São Francisco, no município de São Francisco do Sul (SC), demonstram que ocupa habitat bastante ácidos, com pH oscilando entre 3,9 e 5,8, onde o oxigênio dissolvido varia desde 12 até 100% e a amplitude térmica aquática registrou a mínima em 12,8°C no inverno e máxima de 28,1°C no verão. Nesses ambientes, esta espécie ocorre em sintopia com <em>Scleromystax macropterus, Rachoviscus crassiceps, Spintherobolus ankoseion</em> e, frequentemente, ainda com<em> Rivulus luelingi </em>e <em>Rivulus haraldsioli</em>, espécies - em sua maioria - também ameaçadas. Nesses habitat, <em>M. lateralis</em> é abundante, frequentemente apresentando alta densidade (Duboc e Menezes 2008). Menezes e Weitzman (2009) informam que dados de campo indicam que <em>M. lateralis</em> é totalmente confinada a locais de águas escuras e ácidas. Alguns lotes foram coletados em um córrego de águas escuras nas proximidades de Cananeia (SP), que corre em um trecho perturbado da Mata Atlântica. O córrego apresenta largura média de 1,7 m e 0,4 m de profundidade, e os peixes ocorrem em áreas tanto encobertas pelas sombras, como em áreas abertas, sobre fundo arenoso-rochoso coberto por algas filamentosas e folhas mortas.   <p><em>Mimagoniates lateralis</em> é a menor espécie do gênero, cujos indivíduos alcançam no máximo cerca de 4 cm de comprimento quando adultos (Duboc e Menezes 2008). Como as demais espécies de <em>Mimagoniates</em>, possui dimorfismo sexual acentuado, os machos possuindo na base da cauda uma estrutura especializada em forma de pequena bomba, sustentada por modificações de raios centrais da nadadeira caudal e recoberta por escamas também modificadas. Este órgão, ausente nas fêmeas, quando acionado por movimentação do pedúnculo caudal, ajuda a espalhar o feromônio produzido pelo tecido glandular que fica concentrado em volta de sua abertura, por ocasião do acasalamento. Os machos também possuem cores mais brilhantes que as fêmeas, predominando a coloração acastanhada característica destes peixes (Duboc e Menezes 2008, Oyakawa <em>et al.</em> 2009). Como acontece com as outras espécies de glandulocaudíneos, a fêmea armazena no interior do oviduto os espermatozóides produzidos pelo macho, utilizando-os para fecundação dos óvulos, o que pode ocorrer mesmo decorrido algum tempo (Oyakawa <em>et al. </em>2009). Guimarães<em> et al. </em>(1995) verificaram que <em>Mimagoniates lateralis</em> é caracterizada geneticamente por possuir fórmula cromossômica de 2n = 6m+20sm+16st+10a.</p>","<em>Mimagoniates lateralis</em> apresenta distribuição restrita a riachos florestais de águas avermelhadas/ escuras na planície litorânea entre o litoral sul do estado de São Paulo e norte de Santa Catarina. Embora a área de ocorrência desta espécie, em geral, seja ainda relativamente bem preservada, sofre crescente impacto da ocupação urbana. Estes impactos estão associados mais diretamente ao desmatamento da vegetação ripária e à especulação imobiliária. Além da destruição pura e simples dos habitat específicos de ocupação desta espécie, outros impactos são provenientes da poluição oriunda de efluentes de esgoto doméstico e industrial, despejo descontrolado de lixo, aterros e loteamentos, exploração minerária ou mesmo a exploração eventual – e ilegal – da espécie para a aquariofilia (Duboc e Menezes 2008).","A espécie é abundante localmente, porém pouco frequente; é exigente em relação ao ambiente, típica de um biótopo específico, dependente da vegetação ripária para manter subpopulações viáveis. L.F.D. Silva (obs. pess.) menciona que espécimes de <em>M. laterais</em> foram coletados em gradiente de ambientes bastante íntegros a degradados, geralmente até 5 km da costa. <em>Mimagoniates lateralis</em> e <em>M. microleps</em> não ocorrem juntas no mesmo ambiente no estado do Paraná; em São Paulo, no entanto, podem ocorrer em sintopia, mas em baixas densidades. Não é uma espécie comum em ambientes impactados, ocorrendo em locais muito específicos, que costumam estar bastante fragmentados pela expansão urbana.",Unknown,"A espécie é endêmica do Brasil e ocorre nos riachos e alagadiços de águas ácidas e avermelhadas das regiões litorâneas de Mata Atlântica e restinga entre o sul do estado de São Paulo (Itanhaém) e o norte do estado de Santa Catarina (Araquari) (Duboc e Menezes 2008). No estado de São Paulo é conhecida apenas pela sua ocorrência em pequenos riachos costeiros de água preta, localizados entre as cidades de Santos e Cananeia (Oyakawa <em>et al.</em> 2009). No Paraná, ocorre no alto rio Perequê e afluentes, em riachos costeiros do litoral do estado (Duboc 2007).

Trata-se de uma espécie rara, típica de um biótopo específico, dependente da vegetação ripária para manter subpopulações viáveis. A extensão de ocorrência (EOO), calculada pelo método do mínimo polígono convexo, foi de 9,400 km<sup>2</sup> e ocorre em 8-10 localizações, com base nas principais ameaças à espécie. Os ambientes preferenciais da espécie são bastante sensíveis à degradação ambiental e altamente impactados e fragmentados pela expansão imobiliária litorânea, causando um declínio continuado na qualidade de seu habitat. Desse modo, a espécie foi categorizada como Vulnerável (VU).","<em>Spintherobolus ankoseion</em> é uma espécie miniatura de lambari, com machos maduros com cerca de 1,8 cm de comprimento padrão. Os maiores indivíduos mal alcançam os 3 cm de comprimento padrão. É uma espécie praticamente desconhecida no que diz respeito à biologia e habitat (Duboc e Malabarba 2008). Os ambientes nos quais é registrada incluem córregos e alagadiços de águas avermelhadas a negras e lênticas das planícies litorâneas (Menezes <em>et al. </em>2009), em uma área geográfica restrita. A espécie vem sendo encontrada por pesquisadores do Museu de História Natural Capão da Imbuia (MHNCI) em habitat bastante ácidos, onde o pH oscila entre 3,9 e 5,8 e o oxigênio dissolvido varia de 12 a 100%, com a amplitude térmica aquática registrando a mínima em 12,8°C no inverno e 28,1°C no verão. Todos os ambientes em que a espécie vem sendo encontrada estão associados à vegetação ripária e/ou ribeirinha algo preservada, tornando o seu ecossistema preferencial de ocorrência muito suscetível à ação antrópica, já que esses ambientes estão entre os primeiros a sofrer impacto no processo de ocupação humana (Duboc e Malabarba 2008). Vitule (2007) encontrou a espécie em dois trechos do rio Guaraguaçu (PR), sendo um deles bastante conservado, enquanto o outro apresentava conservação precária. Porém, ambos os trechos contavam com abundante vegetação ripária, e o trecho em pior estado de conservação apresentava grandes bancos de gramíneas introduzidas.","A espécie possui elevado endemismo e pequena distribuição geográfica, com habitat preferencial bastante restrito. Em sua região de ocorrência, há áreas bem preservadas, mas que vêm sofrendo impacto crescente de origem antrópico. Tais impactos são associados principalmente ao desmatamento da vegetação ripária, drenagem, aterros e loteamentos provenientes da especulação imobiliária face à crescente ocupação humana do litoral. Há ainda os impactos decorrentes da poluição oriunda de efluentes de esgoto doméstico e industrial, despejo descontrolado de lixo ou mesmo da exploração mineral. Os habitat preferenciais da espécie, constituídos normalmente por pequenos corpos de água parada ou charcos, são depreciados pela população humana em geral, sendo alvos de drenagens, aterros e até mesmo de deposição de lixo (Duboc e Malabarba 2008).","Poucos exemplares estão registrados em coleções, todos coletados de forma ocasional e pontual, normalmente como exemplares solitários, sugerindo a condição rara da espécie e com baixa densidade populacional (Duboc e Malabarba 2008).",Unknown,"<em>Spintherobolus ankoseion</em> é endêmica do Brasil, conhecida de alguns pontos localizados em córregos e arroios nas florestas costeiras entre Guaraqueçaba, no norte do Paraná, e Içara, sul de Santa Catarina (Duboc e Malabarba 2008).

In Japan, in is found in the Inland Sea of Seto and the western coast of Kyushu. In China, the species occurs in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East China Sea. It is found at depths ranging from one to 30 m. It is found in coastal areas, creeks, and estuaries. <em>Takifugu vermicularis</em>&#160;is a highly-prized food fish in Japan with a high retail value. Aggregate landings data for several species of valuable <em>Takifugu</em> from Japan show an increase in landings to a peak in the late 1990s/early 2000s, followed by a roughly 75% decline in landings to 2007. The relative contribution of <em>T. vermicularis</em> to these landings, however, is unknown. Additional population data from the Yellow Sea reveal decreases in mean size and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from 1985 to 2002, which are indications of possible population decline. Possible threats to <em>T. vermicularis</em> include overfishing, habitat modification and possible negative effects of large-scale aquaculture of congeners, which can introduce pathogens to wild populations. Additionally, this species is considered to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation because of its generally larger size, slow growth rate, late maturation and lower potential rates of population increase. As it is taken in the same fisheries, <em>T.&#160;vermicularis&#160;</em>is likely to benefit from conservation measures in place for <em>T. rubripes</em>.&#160;Due to declining stocks, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005. This plan set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. Available information suggests that this species has undergone population declines in parts of its range, however these are currently unquantifiable. The population of <em>T. vermicularis</em>&#160;is likely conservation dependent, its persistence linked to successful fisheries management. Therefore it is assessed as Near Threatened.<br/><em><br/><br/></em>","<em>Takifugu vermicularis</em> is a temperate, demersal species which occurs near shore in semi-enclosed sea areas and and in estuaries (Yamada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1995).

It has also been collected from creeks in Inchon and Ansan, Korea (Jeon and Yoo 1995).<br/><br/>The lifespan of<em> T. vermicularis</em> is estimated at five years. Growth of this species, in total length, can be related to the growth of the fifth vertebral centrum. The&#160;annual&#160;mark is formed in June. The calculated total length at time was 132 mm in one year, 194 mm in two years, 241 mm in three years, 274 mm in four years, and 299 mm in five years (Matsui <em>et al. </em>1987).&#160;Naturally occurring hybrids of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. vermicularis </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. xanthopterus </span>have been observed from Ariake Bay, Kyushu, Japan (Masuda<em> et al. </em>1991).<br/><br/>The skin and intestine are highly toxic, and the ovaries and liver are extremely toxic. The flesh and testes are believed to be edible although they are slightly toxic, and sometimes highly toxic (Nakabo 2002). In the ovaries, TTX was recognized in the nucleus, yolk vesicles and yolk granules of oocytes (Mahmud<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2003). This species also bio-accumulates saxitoxin, a paralytic shellfish toxin (Nakamura<em> et al. </em>1984). <br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).","<p><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""></span></span></p><p><em>Takifugu vermicularis</em> is considered to be particularly  vulnerable to exploitation  because of its generally larger size, slow  growth rate, late maturation  and lower potential rates of population  increase (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  1990, Jin  and Tang 1996, Xu and Jin 2005).

Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated. Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. vermicularis</em> are unknown, landings of this species, along with other desirable <em>Takifugu</em> spp. have declined by 75% from 2000 to 2007 (Kawata 2012).</p><p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations<br/></strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aquacultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/></p>","Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995 and Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Following sharp decreases in landings of the most highly&#160;desirable&#160;species&#160;beginning&#160;in the mid-1980s, landings of other&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;species steadily increase until reaching a peak in the years 1999 to 2000. A sharp drop in landings of other puffer species, including&#160;<em>T. variomaculatus</em>, occurs from 2000 to 2001 (from ~400,000 to 75,000 tons) and remains below 100,000 lbs until at least 2007.

Although highly valuable (the market price of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em><em>&#160;</em>is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999 (Kikuchi 2006). One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high mortality–survival is estimated to be less than 50% - from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).</p><p>Tiger puffer (<em>T. rubripes</em>) was introduced to China from Japan (Lin and &#160;Huang 2007).

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010). Stock enhancement programs exist for  this species in Japan using  hatchery raised fingerlings (Fushimi 2001).  Optimal release locations  have been determined (Nakajima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>   2008), however it has been found that hatchery-reared juveniles were   more easily preyed upon than wild juveniles due to differences in   swimming depth and TTX concentrations (Shimizu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005).","<span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu bimaculatus</span> is most closely related to<span style=""font-style: italic;""> T. flavidus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).

The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. snyderi</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. chinensis</span>, and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. porphyreus</span>.

Although highly valuable (the market price of<span style=""font-style: italic;""> T. rubripes</span> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger  puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases  (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. bimaculatus,</em>&#160;however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. bimaculatus</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines.

Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<strong>Population structure<br/></strong>Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;revealed that the genetic differences between&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. pseudommus</em>,&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>basilevskiannus</em>, and&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<em>&#160;</em>Additionally,<em>&#160;</em><em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. pseudommus&#160;</em>were previously proposed to belong to the same species as&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;based on analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Song&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Reza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;<span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/><strong>Population trends<br/></strong><em>Takifugu chinensis</em>&#160;is among the top four highly-commercial Fugu species in Japan. These include:&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em>,&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. porphyreus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. xanthopterus. </em>Catch records of&#160;<em>T. chinensis&#160;</em>in on the west coast of Kyushu Island, Japan&#160;have shown a sharp drop from 3600 tonnes/year in 1969, to 2300 tonnes/year in 1972, to 1600 tonnes per year in 1975, to 1000 tonnes/year in 1979, to 200 tonnes/year in 1989, and 100 tonnes in 1999 (Yamada <em>et al. </em>2007). More recent records from the National Fisheries University in Shimonoseki City (the city being famous for its specialized pufferfish-only market),&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;was regularly found in the Fugu fish market in the 1960s at a level of 3000 tonnes, however the figure dropped sharply in the late 1970s through the 1990s. Only one tonne was recorded in 2006 and 2008&#160;(Matsuura pers. comm. 2010).&#160;Based on the above landing statistics, it is estimated that the global population of&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;may have declined by over 99.99% over the last 40 years. Over the course of three generation lengths, or 12 years, this species may have declined by as much as 99%. This estimate is based on landing statistics of harvests from the East China Sea and Yellow Sea provided by the Sekai National Fisheries Institute in Nagasaki and the National Fisheries University in Shimonoseki City. It is also worth noting that&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, one of the most expensive commercial fish species in Japan which is a genetically close relative of&#160;<em>T. chinensis&#160;</em>has also experienced population declines in the region which have been attributed to fisheries mismanagement and overfishing. Despite increasing fishing effort in the region, the wild catch of <em>T. rubripes </em>fell to less than 500 tonnes in 1994, and has continued to decrease ever since (Reza <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><p><em>Takifugu chinensis </em>is uncommon in museum collections, it is represented by eight lots (FishNet2 database searched November 2013).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis</span> is found in the Northwest Pacific, from Northern Kyushu, Japan west to the East China and Yellow seas (Nakabo 2002).&#160;It is found at depths ranging from 5 to 150 metres.","<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis </span>is a highly-desirable, commercially important species.

Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). <br/></p><p>  </p><p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7800 to 11000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks 5th among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high mortality—survival is estimated to be less than 50%—from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>  <p></p>",Marine,"There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis</span>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. chinensis</em>.<br/><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p><p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><strong>Further research</strong><br/>The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is found in the Yellow, Bohai, and East China Seas. It is a coastal species which is found at depths ranging from 10 to 135 m. This species is dependent on estuaries for spawning. Juveniles mature in estuaries and migrate offshore to spawn.<em> Takifugu rubripes</em> is a highly prized food fish in Japan with a high retail value. Population declines which have been attributed to the use of highly-effective fishing gear have been recorded in parts of its range, however range-wide information is currently not available. Available landing information from Japan indicates landings have declined to about 5% of their historical peak from 1987 to 2004. Stocks in the Seto Inland Sea have failed to recover from historical declines resulting from excessive fishing effort and a decline in anchovy stocks. Due to declining stocks, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005. This plan set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is aquacultured in large quantities in order to meet consumer demand, however wild-caught <em>T. rubripes</em> remain highly valued. Stock enhancement programs using aquacultured<em> T. rubripes</em> are in place, however the efficacy of these programs is unknown and mortality in aquaculture is high due to parasitic diseases, which may become introduced into wild populations. Genetic diversity is maintained in both wild populations but is decreased in cultured populations, which may reduce the overall fitness of this species. Available information suggests that <em>T. rubripes</em> has undergone significant population declines in parts of its range. As a highly-valued foodfish the persistence of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em> is highly dependent on species-specific regulatory measures including an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, mandated release of small fishes, and aquacultured fish to meet increasing consumer demand. Therefore, it is considered Conservation Dependent and is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened.","<strong>Habitat and depth distribution<br/></strong><em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is a demersal species. Adults are found in inlet waters, occasionally entering brackish waters.  Fingerlings are often seen in brackish river mouths (Kato<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005) and can tolerate salinities ranging from 25%–100% of that of seawater (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2005). Immature <em>T. rubripes</em> are found in the area between the Seto Inland Sea and the Japanese coast, and they move from the open sea prior to becoming adult fish.&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em>&#160;is unable to live deeper than 150 meters and prefers depths of 100 to 135 meters and above on the continental shelf in the western Enshu Nada (Achiha 2006).&#160;Electronic tagging was used to examine the ecology of this species, and revealed a typical diurnal change in swimming depth with seasonal variations. In winter, this species generally occupies the upper 10 m of the water column, and dives to depths reaching 90 m. In autumn the main swimming layer ranged from the surface to the upper 30 m of the water column (Nakajima 2001). This species exhibits burrowing behaviour.<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction and Life History<br/></strong>The age of first maturity has been estimated at two to three years (Yu 2003,&#160;K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Longevity is estimated at nine years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).&#160;The results of tagging experiments indicate that adult <em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea migrate to coastal areas in western Japan to spawn. After spawning, the puffer seems to migrate again to the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, and to the Gulf of Bohai (Tagawa 1996). <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> returns to the same spawning ground and strongly shows homing behaviour to its natal spawning grounds (Nakajima and Akira 2005).&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em> moves offshore with growth and breeds in the sea (Kato<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005) from March to May. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> spawns demersal eggs which hatch in four to ten days (Sato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). Juveniles mature in shallow bays and river mouths for one year, and then migrate permanently to the open ocean (Kato <em>et al.</em> 2010). Juveniles resemble <em>T. niphobles</em> (Masuda <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Generation length calculation</strong><br/>The generation length of <em>T. rubripes</em> has been estimated using the following formula: A<sub>m</sub> + ((A<sub>max</sub> - A<sub>m</sub>)/2), where&#160;A<sub>m </sub>= age at maturity and A<sub>max </sub>= longevity. The estimated generation length of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 5.75 years.<br/><br/><strong>Toxicity<br/></strong>This species bioaccumulates tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Noguchi <em>et al.</em> 2006). The liver and ovaries are highly toxic, the intestines slightly toxic and the  flesh, skin and testes are innocuous (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/><strong><em>Takifugu</em> and Tetraodontidae<br/></strong>As one of the first vertebrates whose genome has been completely sequenced,&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;has become a model organism for genomics studies (Aparicio&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002).&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes&#160;</em>is morphologically similar to&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. pseudommus</span>, and a number of genome-level molecular studies suggest that they are the same species (Cui&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005), differing only in the color of the anal fin.

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes.

However, this is not likely to relieve the pressure placed on wild stocks, as fished torafugu is preferred to cultured torafugu and commands a higher price. Additionally, cage aquaculture of <em>T. rubripes</em> is often plagued with high mortality due to outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Kikuch 2006)</p><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""referenceText""><span id=""ref_bib4""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata<em> et al</em>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar<em> et al</em>. 1991). Fishes of the genus<em> Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of<em> Takifugu </em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu</em> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant. Japan actively enhances the stock of <em>T. rubripe</em>s. In 1994, Japan produced 2344 x 10<sup>3</sup>&#160;fingerlings, 1722 x 10<sup>3&#160;</sup>of which were released.<br/><br/><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and overfishing</strong><br/>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","<strong>Population structure<br/></strong>Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;revealed that the genetic differences between&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. pseudommus</em>,&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>basilevskiannus</em>, and&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species&#160;<em>T.</em><em>&#160;rubripes</em><em></em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<em>Takifugu chinensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. pseudommus&#160;</em>were previously proposed to belong to the same species as&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;based on analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Song&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Reza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Although established in the Mediterranean, <em>L. spadiceus</em> is not considered invasive and its establishment has not been implicated in negative ecosystem or fishery effects (Akyol <em>et al</em>. 2005). The maximum total length (TL) for this species is 25.0 cm male/unsexed (Bouhlel 1988).<br/><p>Puffers of the genus&#160;<em>Lagocephalus</em>&#160;are globally distributed in warm shallow waters, however classification at the species level in <em>Lagocephalus</em> has not yet been studied in depth, causing confusion in the status of several species including&#160;<em>L. cheesemanii</em>,&#160;<em>L. gloveri</em>,&#160;<em>L. spadiceus</em>, and&#160;<em>L. wheeleri&#160;</em>(Matsuura&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012).

Japanese fisheries data from 1979–2007 show fluctuating landing trends which appear to indicate shifting targets, with marked declines in recent years.&#160;Catch statistics for this species and&#160;<em>L. gloveri&#160;</em>are lumped together as ""sabafugu"" in Japan.&#160;As fewer highly-desirable and notably over-exploited species are landed (Torafugu <em>T. rubripes</em> and Karasu <em>T. chinensis</em>), landings of other species, including sabafugu (<em>L. gloveri</em> and&#160;<em>L. spadiceus</em>)&#160;have declined from a peak of roughly 400 tonnes in 1999 to less than 100 tonnes in 2007, a decline of roughly 75%. These declines have been attributed to the effects of highly-effective long-line fishing (Kawata 2012).<br/><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly-effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><br/>Additional potential threats to<em> L. spadiceus</em> include environmental degradation in parts of its range. Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2005).","The name <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. spadiceus</span> has been widely applied to a number of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus</span> species.

It is more abundant than<em> L. sceleratus</em> in the Mediterranean (Başusta <em>et al.</em> 2013).

Aquacultured Takifugu are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar<em> et al</em>. 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of <em>Takifugu</em> species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <em>et al</em>. 2008).

Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>      <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996).

Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu coronoidus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. coranoidus</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>   <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs.

However, because of its affinity with coral reefs and seagrass beds, we  infer that it may be experiencing population declines due to habitat  loss in parts of its range.This little known species is likely threatened by coral reef and seagrass habitat losses. As of 2008, fifteen percent of the world’s coral reefs were considered under imminent threat of being “Effectively Lost” (with 90% of the corals lost and unlikely to recover soon), with regions in East Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the wider Caribbean being the most highly threatened (Wilkinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Of 704 zooxanthellate reef-building coral species which were assessed by using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Criteria, 32.8% are in categories with elevated risk of extinction (Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2008). One-third of global seagrass species are currently experiencing population declines, and 21% of globally assessed seagrass species are in threatened or Near Threatened categories primarily due to coastal development and pollution (Short <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).<br/><br/>In addition, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. plagiocellatus</span> may be impacted by the following:<br/><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. plagiocellatus&#160;</em>are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.</p>  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012).

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu exascurus</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. poecilonotus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).

Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).   <p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. exascurus.</em>&#160;However, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. exascurus</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing&#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>  <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is found at depths ranging from zero to 20 metres. This species spawns in shallow coastal waters, and the larvae may be dependent on estuaries for their development.&#160;<em>Takifugu flavidus&#160;</em>is the most highly valued Fugu species in China, and has been the subject of artificial breeding efforts in China for the purposes of stock enhancement and in order to supply fish for human consumption. There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place, however generalized&#160;seasonal fishing prohibitions and the presence of both fresh and marine water preserves in parts of its range may offer this species some protection. There are indications of population decline in this species due to habitat degradation, overfishing and other factors. Historical landings from the Yangtzee River basin show steep declines in landings (95%) from the 1950s to the 1970s, and although recent landing statistics are not available, qualitative assessments by scientists in the region indicate that wild stocks of this species are in a state of decline. It is inferred that this species is dependent on fisheries management, such as off-fishing seasons, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and the increasing aquaculture of fish to meet increasing consumer demand which can not be met by wild stocks alone. Therefore, it is considered Conservation Dependent and is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened.&#160;Further research is needed to better quantify stock decline, and may reveal that this species qualifies for a higher threat category, especially given its high commercial value. Due to the economic importance of the&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>genus, and the prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological methods in addition to habitat and population monitoring.","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span> occurs near shore (Yamada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995) over sandy or muddy bottoms at depths ranging from very shallow waters to 20 metres. Although it does not undergo large migrations (Yang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991), it is known to migrate to coastal areas in the spring and summer to spawn, and then return to deeper waters in the autumn and winter. The larvae may be estuarine-dependent, as they remain in the estuaries and coastal areas for months before entering deeper waters (Zhang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). <em>Takifugu flavidus </em>feeds on molluscs and crustaceans. The ovaries, liver, and intestine are highly toxic. The skin is less toxic. The testes are innocuous, but sometimes toxic (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/>The generation length of <em>T. flavidus</em> is estimated at three to four years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011), based on an estimation of the  natural lifespan of this species of six to seven years, with the  age of first maturity occurring between years one and two. This species is bred in captivity.<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).</p>","<p>  </p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/><em>Takifugu flavidus</em> is a high-value, commercially&#160;important  species which is experiencing population declines in spite of artificial  breeding efforts in China (Shi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). At present, the price of <em>T. flavidus</em> is the highest among puffer species in China (Zhang&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. flavidus</em> are not fully understood, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species has been crossed with the commercially important&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in  order to maximize desirable traits both parent species, creating a  commercially-desirable hybrid suitable for aquaculture (Zhao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<strong>Population Structure<br/></strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. bimaculatus</span> (Yamanoue<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008). Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). This species has been crossed with the commercially important <em>T. rubripes</em> in order to maximize desirable traits both parent species, creating a commercially-desirable hybrid suitable for aquaculture (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Additional Population Information<br/></strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span>&#160;is common within its known distribution (Liu and Liu pers comm. 2011).

This species is primarily harvested from the East China Sea, Yellow Sea and Bohai Bay. Due to environmental degradation, overfishing and other factors this species has undergone population declines. <em>Takifugu flavidus</em> is declining in number despite captive cultivation efforts to meet demand (Shi&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). This species may have undergone localized population declines in the Yangtze River basin. Landings from the Yangtze river basin decreased from 1000 tons in 1954, to 130 tonnes in 1968, to &lt;50 tonnes in 1973.

At present, the price of <em>T. flavidus</em> is the highest among puffer species in China (Zhang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). <em>Takifugu flavidus</em>, like other Fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K.

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>)). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (&gt;50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. flavidus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. flavidus</em>.

Juveniles occur in nearshore areas (Suda<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2004). During trawls of the shelf and drop-off areas of southwestern  Sakhalin, maximum catches of this species this were recorded at a  temperature of 16–17°C over depths of 115 to 124 metres. In general, the main  aggregation of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. porphyreus</span> was concentrated over the shelf, at depths shallower than 200 meters (Velikanov and Stominok 2006).<br/><br/><em>Takifugu porphyreus</em> bio-accumulates tetrodotoxin (TTX). The highest concentrations are found in the liver and ovaries, with moderate concentrations found in the skin and intestine  (Noguchi<em> et al. </em>2006). The flesh and testes are innocuous (Nakabo 2002). <em>Takifugu porphyreus </em>species has been induced to spawn and the larvae have been reared in a laboratory setting (Fujita and Abe 1992).<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).","<em></em><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><em><br/>Takifugu porphyreus</em> is commercially targeted for the Fugu  trade. Japanese fisheries data from 1979–2007 show fluctuating landing  trends which appear to indicate shifting targets, and marked declines in  recent years. As fewer highly-desirable and notably over-exploited  species were landed (Torafugu <em>T. rubripes</em> and Karasu <em>T. chinensis</em>), landings of <em>T. porphyreus</em>  began to increase in 1990 and continued to increase until 2003 to a peak  of ~380 tonnes after which landings declined to less than 150 tonnes  between 2005 and 2007. The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. </em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">porphyreus</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p><p>  </p>","<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;inter-specific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Although the recent sharp decrease in landings of <em>T. porphyreus</em> observed from 2003 to 2007<em> </em>is cause for concern, the window of time over which this decline has occurred is insufficient for the application of criterion A.<br/><br/>Several reasons have been given to account for declining populations of targeted Fugu species. Fugu species are&#160;primarily captured by long-line.This fishing method is highly effective and has become widespread with the advent of modified, low-cost, easy-to-use long lines&#160;(Nagai 2003). The targeting of sexually immature individuals between age one and two has resulted in population declines in the commercially-important<em> T. rubripes.</em> It is&#160;inferred&#160;that juvenile <em>T. porphyreus</em> are likely to also be subject to this fishing preference.<br/><br/><em>Takifugu porphyreus</em> appears to be common off southwestern Sakhalin. The results of a trawl survey indicated that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. porphyreus</span> ranked first in catches by the frequency of occurrence (about 55%) among epipelagic fishes. Catches varied from one to eight individuals per trawl (Velikanov and Stominok 2006). In Japan, <em>T. porphyreus</em> is common and can be locally abundant (K.

Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010).

Due to the economic importance of the <em>Takifugu </em>genus, and the   prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend   further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological   methods.","<em>Takifugu pardalis</em> is a temperate, coastal, demersal species over rocky (Yamada<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>1995), sandy, or muddy bottoms as well as in seagrass beds at depths ranging from very shallow to 20 metres. In the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Zostera marina</span> beds off central Japan, juveniles of this species feed mainly on gammaridean and caprellidean amphipods, while adults feed mainly on hard-shelled animals such as gastropods, bivalves and crabs (Horinouchi and Sano 2000). Individuals of this species were more likely to be found in the sandy microhabitat near seagrass beds, as opposed to in the beds themselves (Horinouchi 2009). The ovaries and liver are extremely toxic, the skin and intestine are highly toxic, the testes are slightly toxic, and the flesh is generally believed to be innocuous. However, some specimens have been found to be toxic (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/>This species spawns demersal eggs. In the Yangtze River estuary, this species is known to spawn from May to June, May to July and April to June (Ruijing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs.

Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. xanthopterus</em> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.</p>  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu pardalis</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. chrysops</span> (Yamanoue<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008).

It is found at depths ranging from one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifugu pardalis </em>is incidentally caught, but is not targeted by consumptive fisheries. It is called ""Higan-fugu"" in Japan (Nakabo 2002).&#160;<em>Takifugu pardalis</em>, like other Fugu species, is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is very efficient in catching this species (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).

In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu pardalis</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. pardalis</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines.

However, it is likely to be impacted by the following:<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fugu fishery<br/></span> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. chrysops</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</span><br/> Fishes of the genus Takifugu have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 1991). Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu </span>are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</span><br/> Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). In addition, increasing coastal water temperatures near Japan (Nakano <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996) may be displacing this species.","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chrysops</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. pardalis</span>. Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Matsuura pers comm. 2011).<br/><br/> <em>Takifugu chrysops </em>is moderately common in museum collections, represented by 15 lots (FishNet2 database searched December 2013).

It is found at depths ranging from two to 30 metres.","<em>Takifugu chrysop</em>s is incidentally caught but not explicitly targeted in parts of its range. In Japan, it is called ""Akame-fugu"".<em> Takifugu chrysops</em>, like other Fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).   <p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>There is currently no evidence that this species is artificially cultured. Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger  puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases  (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>  </p><p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu chrysops.</em>&#160;However, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. chysops</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>  <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

This species is likely a&#160;popular food fish in China, Taiwan and Japan. There is little species-specific population information available. This species is non-toxic and safe for consumption as processed and fresh fish product. It appears to be landed in large quantities in parts of its range, but does not appear to be particularly valuable. Based on population trends seen in other species of commercially important pufferfishes it is inferred that this species may be undergoing population declines in parts of its range. It is also likely to be impacted by coastal habitat degradation, particularly near estuaries and river mouths.

These ""other pufferfish"" have declined from a peak of roughly 400 tonnes in 1999 to less than 100 tonnes in 2007, a decline of roughly 75%.

It can be found in salinities ranging from five to 45 ppm (Hoese 1960). In Florida, where it appears to be abundant, it is found in habitats characterized by mangroves or emergent wetland vegetation, such as <em>Spartina spp.</em> (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1999).

The diet consists mainly of invertebrates, principally molluscs and crustaceans (Shipp and Yerger 1969). This species is known to accumulate saxitoxin (Abbott <em>et al.</em> 2009), and has been responsible for poisoning events.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005).</p>","There is little species-specific population information available for <em>T. stictonotus.

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010). Stock enhancement programs exist for  this species in Japan using  hatchery raised fingerlings (Fushimi 2001).  Optimal release locations  have been determined (Nakajima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>   2008), however it has been found that hatchery-reared juveniles were   more easily preyed upon than wild juveniles due to differences in   swimming depth and TTX concentrations (Shimizu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010). Stock enhancement programs exist for  this species in Japan using  hatchery raised fingerlings (Fushimi 2001).  Optimal release locations  have been determined (Nakajima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>   2008), however it has been found that hatchery-reared juveniles were   more easily preyed upon than wild juveniles due to differences in   swimming depth and TTX concentrations (Shimizu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000's had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. basilevskianus</em> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.</p>  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Population Structure</span><br/>Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> revealed that the genetic differences between  <em>T. basilevskiannus</em>, <em>T. pseudommus</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. rubripes</em> are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species <em>T. basilevskiannus</em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to the importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger  puffer is high (&gt;50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases  (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu basilevskianus</em>,&#160;however, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. basilevskianus</em>.&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Fugu Fishery<br/></strong>This species may be taken as bycatch in the Fugu fishery.

Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time, the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1991, Miyaki <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Kai <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).

However, there has been expressed interest in utilizing this resource, and in rearing this species in floating fish cages (Yu 2003). Individuals may occasionally appear in markets. This species is marketed as ""Komon-damashi"" in Japan (Nakabo 2002).<br/><p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are as follows: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger  puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases  (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>  Additionally, the toxic viscera of pufferfish (mainly ovaries and liver) produce tetrodotoxin, which is valued for its many pharmaceutical applications (Yu 2003).",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu alboplumeus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. alboplumbeus</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>  <p><strong>Further Research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is also found in seagrass beds, and has been known to settle on and associate with artificial reefs (Leis<em> et al</em>. 2002).  This species forages on the benthos, feeding mainly on filamentous green and red algae, tunicates, and on smaller amounts of corals (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2008), bryozoans, polychaetes, echinoderms, molluscs, and brown and coralline red algae. By preying on corals, <em>C. valentini </em>may negatively impact their post-bleaching recovery (McClanahan <em>et al</em>. 2005)<br/><br/><em>Canthigaster valentini</em> forms shoals of 10–100 individuals or more, often with the filefish, <em>Paraluteres prionuru</em>s (about 5% of shoal), which mimics the toxic <em>C. valentini</em> to protect it from predators (Smith and Heemstra 1986, Cornic 1987). This species is also mimicked by juvenile coral trout,<em> Plectropomus laevis</em> (Frisch 2006). Maximum total length for this species is 11.0 cm or 110 mm male/unsexed (Smith and Heemstra 1986).<br/><br/><em>Canthigaster valentini</em> is gonochoristic and sexes can be distinguished externally (Gladstone and Westoby 1988). It maintains a sex ratio very close to 1:1, and lives in social groups consisting of a single, sexually  mature male, several mature females, and varying numbers of immature  individuals (Gladstone 1987). Males are territorial and are often seen fighting (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). Spawning occurs at all times of the year. This species is territorial and haremic; males spawn with a different female each day (Lieske and Myers 1994). All sexually mature females are territorial females (Gladstone 1987). The territories of mature females were always enclosed within the territory of a single, mature male. (Gladstone 1987). Social and mating systems of this species are based upon female territoriality where polygyny results from males defending females occupying a certain territory (female-defense polygyny) (Gladstone 1987).  Neither parent guards the eggs which are laid in a nest located in the female's territory (Gladstone 1987). <br/><br/>The eggs and larvae of this species are unpalatable to other species (Gladstone 1987).

They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver.

However, it is likely to be impacted by the following:<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fugu fishery</span><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of Takifugu pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. oblongus</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this minor commercial species are impacted by this fishery. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</span><br/> Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia.

As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991).

It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</span><br/> Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Along the coasts of Pattani and Narathiwat provinces bordering the Gulf of Thailand, samplings were conducted every two months from November 2005 to July 2007 by bottom trawl towing during daylight hours at approximately 2.3 knot for 60 minutes, and only five specimens were collected in a total of 144 hauls (Hajisamae and Yeesin 2010).<br/><br/><em>Takifugu oblongus</em> is common in museum collections, where it was represented by 54 lots (FishNet2 Database searched December 2013).",Decreasing,"In the Indo-West Pacific,<em> T. oblongus</em> is distributed from  South Africa to Indonesia, northward to Japan, southward to Australia. It is found along the coast of the South China Sea, and in the southern part of the east China Sea (Su and Li 2002, Nakabo 2002). It is found at depths of one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifugu oblongus </em>may be a minor component of the Japanese puffer fish trade. It is called ""Taki-fugu"" in Japan. Despite a ban on the sale of toxic pufferfishes in fish markets,&#160;<em>T. oblongus</em> may sometimes found in processed fish products in Taiwan (Huang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/><strong>Aquaculture</strong><br/>There is no evidence that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. oblongus</span> has been artificially cultured. Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. oblongus.</em>&#160;However, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. oblongus</em>.

It is known to inhabit a variety of shallow-water marine and brackish habitats to depths of 10 m, including estuaries, bays, tidal creeks, protected coastal waters, seagrass beds and mangrove swamps. <em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> is common and abundant in parts of its range and may be an important component of the trophic structure in mangrove systems. This species is considered highly toxic and is not targeted by consumption fisheries. There are no major threats, and the only real utilization for this species is for its toxic properties, as a poison to pest mammalians. There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>S. testudineus,</em>&#160;however, its range overlaps several marine protected areas. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.","<strong>Habitat/Ecology</strong><br/><em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> is found predominantly in bays, tidal creeks, protected coastal waters, seagrass beds, mangrove swamps, and estuaries and is confined to very shallow depths over sandy and muddy bottoms (Robins and Ray 1986). It utilizes mangrove roots for protection (MacDonald <em>et al.</em> 2009). It is considered an estuarine-resident in Brazil and is important in the trophic equilibrium of the Paranaguá estuarine complex, where it is common and abundant (Fávaro <em>et al. </em>2009). These habitats include both marine and brackish waters. <em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> is absent or rare on coral reefs. It is more numerically abundant in low-energy estuaries with relatively less marine influence, which are characterized by lower pH, low dissolved oxygen, well-developed mangroves, and low water transparency (<span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5"">Fávaro<em> et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>While this species does not form schools, it is known to form large aggregations. When frightened, this species is known to dive into sandy substrate to take refuge (Lieske and Myers 1994). Juveniles prey mainly on gastropods, bivalves and brachyuran crabs—while adults consume the same prey items as juveniles, the diet gradually shifts to a bivalve and crab-dominant diet, supplemented by amphipods, hermit crabs, seagrasses, detritus, isopods, barnacles, tunicates and sipunculids. Partitioning of food resources enables <em>S. spengleri </em>to coexist with <em>S. testudineus</em> (Targett 1978). <em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> is considered a very successful competitor, and may restrict the ranges of several other members of the genus by competitive exclusion (Targett 1978). As a dominant component of the coastal Yucatan fish fauna, it plays an important role in transferring energy from the benthos to higher trophic levels of the food chain (Chi-Espínola and Vega-Cendejas 2013).<br/><br/>In a study in a Caribbean mangrove habitat, in Honduras, MacDonald <em>et al.</em> (2009) found that checkered puffers spent about 60% of their time resting in place, often protected within the maze of mangrove roots, following brief intervals spent swimming or feeding.<br/><br/><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5"">The results contribute to the biological knowledge of the species and highlight the importance and trophic function of <em>S. testudineus</em> for the energy transfer from the benthos to higher trophic levels of the food chain.<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/><strong>Reproduction</strong><br/><em>Sphoeroides testudineus</em> typically maintains a 1:1 sex ratio.

It is a top predator of hard-shelled prey such as molluscs (Shegemiya 2004).<br/></p><p>Groups nearing 1,000 individuals have been observed to gather off  specific beaches in Japan from late May to early July, annually, to spawn during phases at dusk for several days during spring  tides. Males outnumber females during the spawning season, and <em>T. niphobles </em>will form spawning groups consisting of one ripe female  and several males. As an intertidal spawner, <em>T. niphobles</em> will deposit eggs and  sperm on beaches with rock, pebble, and boulder bottoms. Spawning fish  fling themselves out of the water and fertilization occurs on the beach,  where gametes are then swept back into the sea, or may be incubated  under rocks on the beach, thus enduring periods of exposure to air  (Yamahira 1997, K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). In Hong Kong waters, the annual spawning season of this species is from October to February (Yu and Yu 2002).

In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012).

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu niphobles</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. alboplumbeus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/>Takifugu niphobles</span> is one of the two most common species of puffer fish found in Hong Kong waters, and although traditional fisheries resources have declined drastically in the past decades, <em>T. niphobles </em>can still be easily caught along the seashore (Yu and Yu 2002). Between June 1997 and August 1998, about 100 puffer fish specimens were able to be easily collected&#160; from Hong Kong waters every two months for toxicity studies (Yu and Yu 2002). This species is also described as being very common along the coasts of Japan (Honma<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>1980). Between March 2007 and February 2008, fish sampling was conducted  during the spring tide once a month in northwestern Kyushu Island,  Japan. Juveniles of this species were a numerically dominant component  of the surf zones of sandy beaches, representing 13.6% of the total  catch (Inui <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). It has also been described as as abundant in Cheonsu Bay, Korea (Lee 1995).&#160;<br/><br/><em>Takifugu niphobles</em> is very common in museum collections.

In Japan this species is called ""Kusa-fugu"" (Nakabo 2002). Despite a ban on the sale of toxic pufferfishes in fish markets,&#160;<em>T. niphobles</em> may sometimes found in processed fish products in Taiwan (Huang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<em> Takifugu niphobles</em>, like other fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K.

Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia to meet the increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region&#160;(Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. niphobles,</em>&#160;however, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. niphobles</em>.<br/></p>    <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/><em>Takifugu niphobles</em> is not a targeted species in the Fugu fishery, however it is taken incidentally. The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>     <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>     <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu poecilonotus</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. exascurus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). <br/><em><br/>Takifugu poecilonotus</em> is common and can be locally abundant in Japan, where it is seen in small schools of less than 20 individuals (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). During bi-monthly underwater visual censuses in the sub-tidal habitat of  Nagahama, Wakasa Bay, Sea of Japan, over five years from January 2002 to  December 2006, this species was observed during 153 of 360 transect  surveys and was the most frequently  observed tetraodontid. Sighting frequency was independent of water  temperature. This species was also observed during similar underwater  visual surveys conducted from 1970 to 1972, although the exact number could  not be found because the survey could not be accessed (Masuda 2007). Fifteen specimens of this species were collected in the surfzone of a sandy beach in Southern Japan, where it was more abundant than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. reticularis (</span>six specimens collected) but far less abundant than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. niphobles</span> (118 specimens collected) (Inoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>Takifugu poecilonotus</em> is moderately in museum collections.

In Japan, this species is distributed from 23°–45° N (Masuda 2007). It is found at depths ranging from one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifufu poecilonotus</em> is incidentally harvested for food but is not targeted (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Although it is sometimes marketed as ""Komon-fugu"" in Japan (Noguchi and Arakawa 2008), this species displays a frequent occurrence of considerably high levels  of TTX in its muscle tissue, and its preparation and consumption has  been been cited as a public concern (Kodama <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1984). Despite a ban on the sale of toxic pufferfishes in fish markets,&#160;<em>T. poecilonotus</em> may sometimes found in processed fish products in Taiwan (Huang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<em> Takifugu poecilonotus</em>, like other fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K.

Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>  </p><p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu poecilonotus,</em>&#160;however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. poecilonutus</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines.

The ovaries and liver are highly toxic, the intestine is  slightly toxic, and the flesh, skin and testes are innocuous (Nakabo  2002). This species has also been found to contain a non-toxic  derivative of TTX in its liver, which is thought to be a precursor or  metabolite of TTX (Nagashima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006).<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan.

Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012).

Water temperature ranges from 22-26 <sup>o</sup>C (Schmitter-Soto 1996). In Yucatan, occupied sites include pools accessible by foot that are heavily impacted by solid waste. In Quintana Roo, habitat includes fully flooded caves with clear water that are relatively undisturbed (J. Schmitter-Soto pers. comm. 2018).</p><p>Although this species primarily inhabits flooded caves, and therefore lives nowhere near the surface (consequently mostly observable by cave diving), surface-dwelling populations have been observed in cenotes that are protected by a dry cave entrance (of varying length) and are therefore mostly or fully dark (J. Arroyave pers. comm. 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Its diet is comprised primarily of aquatic invertebrates (Pohlman<em> et al.</em> 1997). This species is viviparous with parturition occurring from December to February, and exhibits a relatively low fecundity of 2-11 individuals per batch (Schmitter-Soto 1998, Proudlove<em> et al.</em> 2001).&#160;</p>","<p>The primary threat to <em>T. pearsei</em> is water pollution and associated declines in habitat quality from industrial, agricultural and municipal sources (Proudlove 2001). Specifically, fecal coliform and excess nitrate resulting from inadequate sewage treatment and wastewater disposal threaten the water quality of the aquifer (Cruickshank <em>et al.</em> 1980, Schmitter-Soto 1998, Proudlove <em>et al.</em> 2001). This is particularly alarming considering the ongoing exponential growth of the tourism industry, especially in the state of Quintana Roo. Given the nature of karst aquifers, the habitat of <em>T. pearsei</em> is very sensitive to contaminants and bacteria transport, and in fact, it has been shown that septic tanks leaching into the groundwater are&#160;having an impact on groundwater quality (Kane 2016, Saint-Loup<em> et al.</em> 2018). Furthermore, the combination of anthropogenic contamination and groundwater extraction, coupled with saltwater intrusion in coastal cenotes - as in those from the Riviera Maya in Quintana Roo - constitutes a serious threat to the integrity of the aquifer freshwater (Deng <em>et al.</em> 2017), and therefore to the species that are restricted to these fragile ecosystems, such as&#160;<em>T. pearsei</em>. &#160;</p>  <p>Additional threats include salinization of suitable habitat due to groundwater over-extraction and declines in habitat quality due to inadequate disposal of solid waste (Schmitter-Soto 1998, Ceballos <em>et al.</em> 2016). </p><p>Cave divers from the Riviera Maya have reported that a possible threat to&#160;<em>T. pearsei</em>&#160;is the artificial presence of fishes from the genus&#160;<em>Astyanax</em>&#160;in the cave section of cenotes (where they do not normally reside), after these are lured into the caves by the flashlights of cave divers, potentially resulting in negative interspecific interactions such as competition, aggression, or even predation (J. Arroyave pers. comm. 2018).</p>","<p>The total population size of this species is unknown. However, it is likely relatively small, given that <em>T.</em>&#160;<em>pearsei&#160;</em>occupies the highest trophic position where it occurs (Pohlman <em>et al. </em>1997). Populations sizes are likely small based on the very few numbers of individuals (&lt; 5-10) observed by cave divers in most caves where the species is present (J. Arroyave pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Population trends unknown but might be affected by declining water quality (Schmitter-Soto 1998, Proudlove <em>et al. </em>2001, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ceballos <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barrientos-Medina and Gasca Tenorio 2017). The population size in Quintana Roo appears low but population trend is relatively stable (J.

The total number of cenotes where this species occurs is unknown. Recent focused sampling of the species&#160;throughout the Yucatan Peninsula has resulted in an additional 31 records (documented with voucher specimens; J.

Exploitation for (illegal) international trade to East Asia increased sharply in the late 1990s. Since then, trade appears to have shifted from live specimen trade to processed meat and in particular the trade in ‘calipee’, the dried and processed cartilaginous margin of the carapace. Well over 16,400 live specimens, in 19 shipments, were documented as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000–2015, the fourth most numerously seized CITES-listed turtle species, and the most numerously seized Appendix I turtle species (CITES CoP17 Doc73). Seized shipments of calipee can be huge and are normally not identified to species.<br/><br/>In some places (such as the Indus basin), animals are persecuted by fishermen as perceived nuisance.

Choudhury <em>et al. </em>(2000) considered the species common throughout its range in India, but possibly in decline. Participants at the 2005 Red List Workshop considered that the species remained fairly widespread and common in Northeastern India and in Bangladesh, but had declined severely elsewhere over the previous 12 years and in places was nearly gone. By the time of the 2011 Asian Turtle Red List Workshop in Singapore, better survey and trade data available by then indicated that a drastic reduction in numbers, and size of animals had occurred, with an estimate made that the species’ overall population had likely more than halved. <em>Nilssonia gangetica</em> remains widespread and stable in temple ponds.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Nilssonia gangetica</em> occurs throughout the northern plains of the Indian Subcontinent, in the Indus, Ganga, Narmada and Mahanadi basins and most tributaries and intervening drainages of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan (Schneider and Djalal 1970), and the Brahmaputra basin (Das 1995, Iverson 1992, Praschag and Gemel 2002).

Exploitation for (illegal) international trade to East Asia increased sharply in the late 1990s, when peak volumes of 60–80 tons per week were reported in East Asian markets (TFTSG and ATTWG 2000). In recent years, trade has shifted from live specimens to trade in calipee (dried, processed cartilage from the carapace margin). A single confiscation from illegal trade, involving an unreported number of live specimens, has been reported during the period 2000–2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73), though<em> </em>Das<em> et al.</em> (2010) referred to its occurrence in five seized consignments in Uttar Pradesh in 2009 alone.

In addition to targeted exploitation, Choudhury and Bhupathy (1993) and Das<em> et al.</em> (2010) noted riverine habitat destruction in the Ganga as having adversely affected the species.

However, it is rare in Sindh, southern Pakistan (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Bangladesh the species was considered to still occur in good numbers in the southeast of the country (relatively better than<em> N. gangetica</em>), but under increasing exploitation pressure (P.

It is listed as Critically Endangered because it has experienced a population reduction of over 99% over the last two generations; its area of occupancy is less than 10 km<sup>2</sup>, its population is severely fragmented, and in continuing decline; and there number of mature individuals is less than 50.</p>","According to Heude (1880), some of the specimens he described were caught in the Huangpu River (the largest river flowing through Shanghai and the last significant tributary of the Yangtze before it empties into the East China Sea), and some in and on the shores of Tai Hu near Suzhou. All these wetlands are interconnected through the Grand Canal, the oldest and longest canal in the world with a history of over 2,500 years. The Yangtze subpopulation therefore appears to have inhabited lowland lakes and rivers in the Yangtze coastal plain. Pritchard (2012), reviewing records of the species in Viet Nam, describes it as cryptic, fairly sedentary, inhabiting sluggish or still waters associated with major rivers, shuffled into the mud and detritus on the bottom, and eating almost anything organic. Wang <em>et al. </em>(2013) reviewed the habitat selection of <em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> in the upper Red River, China, and demonstrated that they were mainly recorded in river sections with sandbars and in particular at confluences of tributaries with the main river where the water was deeper. They seem to occur in deep sections of large rivers, in backwaters and in lakes. The two known live wild individuals in Viet Nam both live in semi-artificial lakes (dammed back with barrier structures).&#160;The captive <em>R. swinhoei </em>in China accepts animal matter like fish, various mammalian meats, chicken, crayfish, snails, salad and other plants, and also sadly junk food thrown into his pond by visitors&#160;(Kuchling <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). At least adults of the species are omnivorous. The female in China preferred to nest on open, sunny sand banks and avoided different soil and vegetation cover (Kuchling unpublished), but nothing is known of nest site selection in the wild. Nothing is also known on the biology and habitat selection of hatchlings and juveniles.<br/><br/>The Yangtze female was well over 90 years of age at the time of death and usually laid three, sometimes four, clutches per year of 55 to 65 (infertile) eggs each. This suggests a generation time of at least 100 years.","<p><em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> remains under extreme pressure from exploitation of adults and eggs for (subsistence) consumption and targeted capture attempts in recent years due to its increased value. In addition, it has been affected by habitat loss through conversion, drainage, fragmentation and pollution of wetlands and riparian habitats, and hydroelectric barrages and sand mining.</p>","<p>An adult male of the Yangtze population has been kept for decades at the Suzhou Zoo in China. A female in the same zoo died in April 2018 and had mated many times with the male without producing fertile eggs. A male of the Red River subpopulation inhabited for a long time Hoan Kiem Lake in downtown Hanoi, Viet Nam, but died in January 2016. Another individual of the Red River subpopulation of unknown sex inhabits Dong Mo Lake west of Hanoi (subsequently captured in October 2020 and confirmed to be a female; WCS 2020) and a further individual was recently confirmed by eDNA in Xuan Khanh Lake, not far from Hanoi and Dong Mo Lake (Asian Turtle Program Press Release 11th April 2018). Surveys of the Red River basin in both Yunnan and Viet Nam in recent years have hinted at the possible survival of one or more animals, at least until recent times, but had not documented confirmed additional living animals until the capture of a female in October 2020. While the species has declined substantially over recent historical times, extensive records were known from the Red River subpopulation in both China and Viet Nam from the 1960s until the 1990s (Pritchard 2012). The last records from the lower Yangtze River region date from the 1930s. The decline accelerated greatly with increased agricultural and industrial development since the 1980s, and assuming a generation time of 100 years, has probably declined by over 99% over the past two generations.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Historical records for <em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> exist from throughout the Red River basin of Yunnan and Viet Nam, as well as the coastal plains of northern Viet Nam. The species is also known from the lower Yangtze lowlands of eastern China. Based on late Pleistocene and Holocene fossils from Zhejiang and Taiwan Straits, speculatively it may historically have occurred in the Pearl River system and other drainages between northern Viet Nam and the Yangtze delta.<br/><br/>At the time of assessment, the current distribution in the wild was limited to two animals in reservoirs near Hanoi; the possibility remained of rediscovery in other northern Vietnamese wetlands. In October 2020, a female turtle was captured in a Dong Mo Lake near Hanoi and the genetic results confirmed it to be this species (WCS 2020).

The late female at Suzhou Zoo was reportedly bought at Suzhou market in the 1930s by a travelling animal show. The main use of <em>R. swinhoei </em>is for meat consumption on the local village level or in restaurants. In 1998 a <em>R. swinhoei </em>was rescued from a restaurant at the Chinese Red River and released (Wang <em>et al. </em>2013). In 2008 the known individual of Dong Mo Lake in Viet Nam was caught by a fisherman who offered it for sale to a restaurant, but it was bought back and rescued by the Asian Turtle Program.

La Alberca caldera is an elevated extinct volcanic crater lake, groundwater fed (there are no rivers or streams entering the lakes), with locals and natives indicating other crater-lakes used to be spring fed, but these have dried.

The analysis of water quality shows that it is highly transparent, since the turbidity fluctuates between 10 and 18 UFT and has few suspended solids (up to 15 mg/L). The hardness expressed as calcium carbonate varies depending on the time of year, but it goes from 19 to 79 mg/L and the pH is strongly alkaline given that it reaches values of around 9.5 (Díaz-Pardo pers. obs/ 2001).&#160;Maximum known S.L. 81 mm (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2005).","<em>Chirostoma bartoni </em>is threatened by severe water abstraction and resulting drought of the lake, water pollution and the non-native invasive species <em>Oreochromis aureus</em> (Blue Tilapia) and <em>Oreochromis mossambicus</em> (Mozambique Tilapia) are invasive species, both of African origin (Lozano and García 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Along the shoreline of the lakes, garbage is a common feature, as well as the water being polluted with washing bleaches and detergents discharged into the littoral zone of the lake without any controls.

3047556,5668,Crocodylus porosus,Least Concern,,2021,2019-11-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a species, the global population of <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> is secure because of large populations, extensive habitat and effective management in Australia, Papua New Guinea and, to a lesser degree, Indonesia. There are increasing <em>C. porosus </em>populations in the Solomon Islands, Sarawak and Sabah due to effective protection measures, although management may require incentives derived from sustainable use in order to counter negative public attitudes towards them.","<em>Crocodylus porosus</em> is considered the largest of the living crocodilians, with reported lengths of up to 6–7 m (Webb and Manolis 1989, 2009; Whitaker and Whitaker 2008). <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> preys on people when given the opportunity. It is one of the most widely distributed of all crocodilians, ranging from southern India and Sri Lanka, throughout southeast Asia, east through the Philippines to Micronesia, and down through Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands to northern Australia.<br/><br/>Within this distribution, <em>C. porosus </em>occupies a wide of wetland habitats from the sea (including thousands of islands) to hundreds of kilometres inland. A great deal of ecological research was carried out in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Contrary to its common name “Saltwater crocodile”, which implies a marine existence, the species commonly inhabits non-tidal freshwater sections of rivers, and inland freshwater lakes, swamps and marshes. Indeed, it thrives in freshwater environments and some of the highest densities of <em>C. porosus </em>have been reported from heavily vegetated freshwater swamps without any tidal inﬂuence (Webb et al. 1977; 1984). Breeding and recruitment take place principally in rivers with signiﬁcant freshwater input, or in freshwater swamps (Jelden 1981, Webb <em>et al</em>. 1983, Cox 1985). In the marine environment it mostly inhabits tidal rivers and creeks, where salinity changes with different seasons and distance upstream, but they regularly move around the coast between rivers and occupy offshore islands.<br/><br/>Long-distance voyages at sea occur (Allen 1974, Manolis 2005) with unknown frequency (e.g. Cox 1985; Jelden 1985; Webb <em>et al</em>. 1984, 1987; Messel and Vorlicek 1989; Webb and Manolis 1989, 2009). Historical and recent data suggest that individuals move between range states (e.g. Malaysia-Singapore, Australia-Timor Leste). However, the species demonstrates high site fidelity, with long distance movements usually associated with translocated adults, or sub-adult and sub-dominant crocodiles dispersing in search of a territory. Individual crocodiles are also known to travel long distances between breeding and non-breeding sites (&gt;100 km) as well as to and from seasonal feeding sites (e.g. sea turtle nesting). The exact nature of these movements is not well known.<br/><br/>In the tidal waterways of northern Australia, the movement of <em>C. porosus </em>between river systems appears to be related to sex and ontogenetic changes in social status. Radio and satellite tracking of large, male <em>C. porosus </em>are now providing insights into the pattern of movement out of rivers onto the coast, between river systems, and within tidal and non-tidal habitats, including homing associated with relocated individuals (Read <em>et al</em>. 2007, Kay 2004, Brien <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, a recent study involving the genetic analyses of <em>C. porosus</em> nests along the Northern Territory coast, combined with satellite tracking data from five translocated adult males, revealed that the Coburg Peninsula appears to be a significant geographical barrier to movement and dispersal of <em>C. porosus </em>from the east and west of the Northern Territory (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>While the species is highly territorial, they are known to congregate at times of the year when resources are abundant. There are multiple reports of large numbers of adult crocodiles congregating around dead cattle floating in rivers of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. At Shady Camp lagoon on the Mary River, Northern Territory, large numbers (&gt;100) of sub-adult and adult crocodiles have been reported congregating at a barrage separating tidal from non-tidal waters when mullet are spawning. A similar occurrence happens on islands and beaches of northern Australia each year during sea turtle nesting seasons (e.g. green, flatback, etc.).<br/><br/>In the Northern Territory of Australia, the recovery of wild <em>C. porosus </em>populations following protection (1971) was carefully documented, providing new information on population dynamics. Increasing numbers of large crocodiles over time have been accompanied by decreasing numbers of small crocodiles (Webb and Manolis 1992, Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2011), which are predated or excluded from rivers and sometimes forced into marginal habitats, including upstream freshwater areas used for recreation by people (Letnic and Connors 2006).<br/><br/>Female <em>C. porosus </em>mature at around 2.2–2.5 m (12+ years of age in the wild). They lay their eggs in a mound of vegetation during the annual wet season (October-May; Webb <em>et al</em>. 1977, 1983). Mean clutch size in Australia is around 50 eggs at 113 g per egg (Webb <em>et al</em>. 1983), whereas in Papua New Guinea it is around 60 eggs at 100 g per egg (Cox et al. 2006). Incubation is typically 80-90 days (depending on temperature). As nesting is a wet season activity, loss of nests due to ﬂooding is typically very high (Webb et al. 1983; Cox 1985). Some wild females actively defend their nests and loss of eggs to non-human predators is exceptionally low. Lizards (varanids) take eggs, but usually when the eggs are dead and rotten, and can be located by smell. The recent invasion of Cane Toads (<em>Rhinella marina</em>) into the Northern Territory has reduced the varanid population which reduces this egg predation risk. The loss of very small numbers of eggs to rodents has been recorded (WMI, unpublished data), and wild pigs have been reported to raid <em>C. porosus </em>nests, but the signiﬁcance of this has not been demonstrated.<br/><p>  </p>","<p></p><strong>Human-crocodile conflict (HCC)</strong> – The largest risk posed to successful <em>C. porosus </em>conservation is the cohabitation of humans with an apex predator. Public awareness and education programs can help alleviate parts of this threat such as “Be CrocWise” (Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia in Australia). However, when <em>C. porosus </em>and humans are forced to cohabit, and even compete for resources (e.g. fishing), the risk of conflict will increase. Innovative solutions to further mitigate these risks are urgently required for continued conservation success.<br/><br/><strong>Land use</strong> – <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> attack cattle and other livestock as they drink at the water’s edge. Pastoralists involved in the Northern Territory of Australia’s egg and wild harvests are compensated to some degree for stock losses, and are also provided with incentives to conserve habitats. Elsewhere, retaliation killings occur as crocodiles threaten the livelihoods of local people. Fishermen inadvertently trap and kill crocodiles with fishing equipment (hooks and nets).<br/><br/><strong>Food </strong>– Unregulated fishing may be depleting fish stocks in some range states, which could have detrimental effects on <em>C. porosus </em>populations both from resource competition and increasing interactions leading to HCC.<br/><br/><strong>Invasive weeds </strong>– Introduced plants for the pastoral industry including Para Grass (<em>Urochloa mutica</em>) in northern Australia have a high heat during decomposition which increases the temperature experienced by the developing embryos within the nest. No research into the effects on embryo survival or resultant sex ratios has been conducted to know if detrimental impacts could result. Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipe</em>) is also a reported as a problem in Sri Lanka (Samarasinghe and Chandrasiri 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Invasive pests </strong>– No detrimental impacts on Australian <em>C. porosus </em>from the introduced Cane Toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>) have been reported so far (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2016). Feral pigs and buffalo are known to have impacted negatively on nesting in some areas in northern Australia, but the significance has not been quantified (C. Manolis, pers. comm. 2019). In Papua New Guinea, introduced ﬁsh species (<em>Piaractus brachypomus </em>and <em>Barbonymus gonionotus</em>) to degrade nesting habitats (Cox <em>et al</em>. 2006, G. Solmu, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Habitat destruction and pollution</strong> – Urban encroachment, sand mining, tourism and agriculture threaten habitat modification for <em>C. porosus </em>as well as pollutants (Samarasinghe and Chandrasiri 2013, Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. 2015) in some range states.<br/><br/><strong>Traditional harvesting </strong>– Some traditional harvesting occurs by indigenous peoples throughout the range states but poses little threat to the overall <em>C. porosus </em>populations.<br/><p></p>","The total wild population of <em>Crocodylus porosus</em> is estimated to be in excess of 400,000 non-hatchlings. As a species, the global population of <em>C. porosus</em> is secure because of large populations, extensive habitat and effective management in Australia, Papua New Guinea and to a lesser degree Indonesia (mainly Papua and West Papua Provinces). There are increasing <em>C. porosus</em> populations in the Solomon Islands and Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah) due to effective protection measures and future management may require incentives derived from sustainable use to counter growing negative public attitudes due to human-crocodile conflict (HCC). Reintroduction and protection efforts in Bhitarkanika National Park, India, have been successful although increasing HCC is now occurring. In contrast, re-establishment of populations outside of protected areas in India may never be possible due to the large human population and lack of suitable habitat. Likewise, re-establishment of wild populations of <em>C. porosus</em> in Thailand, Viet Nam and Cambodia, where the species has long been presumed extinct, is unlikely, even in protected areas.<br/><br/>The species has the most commercially valuable skin of any crocodilian (Fuchs 2006) and was intensively hunted for skins historically throughout its range, particularly from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. Restoration of depleted populations have been demonstrated to recover reasonably quickly if: (1) habitats are intact; (2) they are given the opportunity through effective protection; and (3) people are prepared to tolerate expanded populations. Examples are the populations in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia which have also implemented successful sustainable use models to assist in this recovery. However, elsewhere these preconditions have not been met. Habitat loss continues to be a major problem in many areas occupied by <em>C. porosus</em>, and frequently they are killed as pests regardless of whether their skin is used commercially or not. Another significant source of mortality is drowning in fishing nets, especially in river systems where commercial net fishing occurs (eg. northern Australia). Therefore, resourceful incentives will be required to enhance the tolerance of people co-existing with these apex predators with HCC considered the largest risk to their continued abundance.<br/><br/>Information on the current status of <em>C. porosus</em> in each range state is summarized as:<br/><br/><strong>Australia</strong><br/>Surveys by Professor Harry Messel and colleagues established the baseline for crocodile monitoring in northern Australia in the 1970s (e.g. Messel <em>et al</em>. 1978-1987). The population was protected (Western Australia 1970; Northern Territory 1971; Queensland 1974) after intensive unregulated hunting commenced in 1945-46. The recovering Australian population was transferred to CITES Appendix II (for ranching) under Resolution Conf. 3.15 in 1985 (Webb <em>et al</em>. 1984), and was given an unqualiﬁed Appendix-II listing in 1994 (under the old Berne Criteria, as Resolution Conf. 9.24 was only agreed to in 1994, at the same CITES meeting). Australia is considered the most secure long-term stronghold for C. porosus throughout its range due to large tracts of relatively uninhabited land and a successful sustainable use program that lead to the exportation of nearly 35,000 skins in 2015 (Caldwell 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>Northern Territory</em></strong>: Spotlight surveys carried out since the early 1970s indicate that in some rivers the population continues to increase, whereas in others the numbers have stabilized (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2011) despite high levels of legal egg harvest (ranching program) in almost all river systems (Saalfeld <em>et al</em>. 2016). The size structure is now biased towards larger animals (&gt;2 m), and total crocodile biomass continues to increase, even in rivers where numbers have stabilized (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2011). The total population in the Northern Territory is considered to be near pre-exploitation levels with an average of five non-hatchling crocodiles per km (Webb <em>et al</em>. 2000, Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2011, Saalfeld <em>et al</em>. 2016). A sustainable use program based on ranching of wild eggs forms the basis of management (Leach <em>et al</em>. 2009, Saalfeld <em>et al</em>. 2016), combined with a program of problem crocodile removal (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2014) and a limited wild harvest by landowners. Recognising the public impact of living with a large predator, the Northern Territory government runs a public education program called “Be Crocwise” to reduce HCC (<a href=""https://becrocwise.nt.gov.au"">becrocwise.nt.gov.au</a>). Eight farms are currently in operation and crocodiles were estimated to add $54.3 million to the Northern Territory economy from direct and indirect contributions of employment, capital expenditure and tourism (Ernst and Young 2017). There is no evidence that introduced cane toads (Rhinella marina) have impacted on C. porosus at all (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2016). Buffalo are known to have impacted negatively on nesting in some areas in northern Australia, but the significance has not been quantified (C. Manolis, pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/><strong><em>Western Australia</em></strong>: Major <em>C. porosus </em>populations occur in the northwest of the state. Between 1992 and 2012, the population monitoring program was based on an annual aerial survey in the Cambridge Gulf (Ord River, West Arm), with spotlight surveys carried out less regularly in some areas (Mawson 2004). Regular monitoring is currently restricted to an annual spotlight survey of the King River, which has been surveyed fairly consistently since 1989 (1989–1990, 1992–2015, 2017–2019; WMI 2019a). Helicopter surveys indicated a 5.1% per annum (p.a.) population increase in the Ord River (2000–2008) and a 4.1% increase in West Arm (1999–2008) with no signs that the populations were approaching stability (WMI 2008). Recent spotlight surveys of the Ord River in 2019 suggest that the population in the tidal mainstream may be approaching stability, but the population in the upstream non-tidal mainstream continues to increase significantly (WMI 2019b). In 2015, spotlight surveys of the Prince Regent, Hunter and Roe Rivers confirmed healthy breeding populations with a 300% increase in abundance since 1970 (Parke 2015). Cattle grazing is a potential threat to some nesting habitats, and some illegal harvesting of eggs is known to have occurred in 2009–2010.<br/><br/>The increasing <em>C. porosus </em>population has prompted authorities to implement a public safety program, similar to the “Be Crocwise” program in the Northern Territory (Parke 2017). Legal harvesting of juveniles, sub-adults, adults and eggs was undertaken in West Arm between 1989 and 1994 to provide stock for crocodile farms. However, only one farm is currently in operation, in Broome, and it is based solely on captive breeding.<br/><br/><em><strong>Queensland</strong></em>: There is a high-density human population on the east coast of Queensland and signiﬁcant habitat alteration for agriculture. The abundance of <em>C. porosus </em>varies between river systems, with the highest densities of crocodiles reported from northwest Cape York Peninsula (Read <em>et al</em>. 2004a, b). The most recent surveys (2009–2010) of 48 major waterways (735 km surveyed) along the east coast of Queensland revealed a relative density of 0.49±0.72 non-hatchlings/km (Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service 2010). For those individuals where size could be estimated (N=258), crocodiles ranged from hatchlings to 3.8 m, with 73% less than 2 m (13% were hatchlings). The number of non-hatchlings could be an under-estimate as 33% of crocodiles counted were “eyes only” which does not allow length to be estimated but tend to be larger, more wary crocodiles. On western Cape York Peninsula, surveys based in 10 key river systems in 2008 showed a relative density of 0.85 non-hatchlings/km with successful nesting occurring (Big Gecko, pers. comm. 2009). Identiﬁable threats to nesting success include feral pests (pigs) and invasive weeds.<br/><br/>Over the last ten years authorities have been under increasing public pressure to deal with increasing numbers of saltwater crocodiles in urban areas, which seems to be in response to more larger crocodiles moving around the coast, an increasing human population, and increased publicity and the ability to easily report sightings (Brien et al. 2017). The highest number of attacks, sightings, removals and relocations have occurred along the populated east coast between Townsville and the Daintree River during wet season months (November-February; Brien <em>et al</em>. 2017). There were 35 crocodile attacks in Queensland between 1971 and 2015 (total 0.8 per year; fatal 0.3 per year), mostly involving local people or regular visitors (77.1%), specifically adult males (71.4%; mean age 44 years; Brien <em>et al</em>. 2017). There has been an increase in the rate of crocodile attacks over time, with an average of 1.3 per year since 1996, most of which were non-fatal (84%; Brien <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In response, in 2017, the Queensland Government embarked on a 3-year monitoring program involving systematic spotlight and helicopter surveys in carefully selected, previously surveyed river systems throughout the state. This is the most comprehensive program since 2003, and will be used to determine the size, distribution and abundance and extent of recovery of the C. porosus population over time. Currently, the Queensland Crocodile Management Plan (<a href=""https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/87711/wl-mp-croc-manage-plan.pdf"">https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/87711/wl-mp-croc-manage-plan.pdf</a>) consists of six clearly defined zones, from Central to Far North Queensland, with management actions determined by the zone-specific risks of interactions between crocodiles and people. Similar to the Northern Territory problem crocodile program (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2014), any C. porosus that poses a threat to human safety is removed or relocated. So far, 608 crocodiles have been relocated although this number has fluctuated widely between years (range 1-57; Brien <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The utilization of crocodiles on Queensland farms is mostly limited to captive breeding, with some farms importing large numbers of Northern Territory and Western Australian sourced eggs and/or juvenile crocodiles. However, an important step towards improving the public perception of crocodile use was attained in late 2018 by a change in legislation (Nature Conservation Act 1994) to allow for a limited wild egg harvest program. Currently (2019) there is only one permit in place for this to occur in Pormpuraaw, northwestern Cape York.<br/><br/><strong>Bangladesh</strong><br/>In Bangladesh, <em>C. porosus</em> are restricted to the Sundarbans (Ganges delta). In 1982, four crocodiles and 20 tracks were recorded during daytime (450 km) and nighttime (95 km) surveys. In 2014–2015, daytime surveys in 351 km of river recorded 42 crocodiles (Aziz and Islam 2018). In 2016, 60 crocodiles and 31 tracks were recorded during the day in 1,893 km of river. Protected in 1974, the population was estimated to comprise 150–200 individuals in 1985, 250–300 adult <em>C. porosus </em>in 2000, and by 2012 it was considered to not exceed 100–150 adults (Rashid 2013). The reduction in the population is due to a variety of reasons, including an increasing human population, habitat alteration and illegal killing (eg ﬁshermen believe crocodiles compete with them for ﬁsh; Manik 2009). In February 1999, 14,300 ha (143 km²) or 2.3% of the Bangladesh Sundarbans was declared a wildlife sanctuary where extraction/collection of wildlife resources was banned. The sanctuary includes Kotka-Kochikhadi in East Sundarbans, Notabele in West Sundarbans, and Nikamol in South Sundarbans. <br/><br/>The Karamjal Crocodile Breeding Centre (KCBC) was established in 2000, and in 2016 breeding stock consisted of two females and one male (Anon 2016a). In early 2017, total stock comprised 215 crocodiles (Anon 2017) from this limited founder population. One of the goals of the KCBC is to make animals available for release into the wild. However, by early 2016, only about 19 <em>C. porosus </em>had been released into canals and rivers of the Sundarbans (Anon 2016b, Manik 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Brunei</strong><br/>Little information is available on the status of <em>C. porosus </em>in Brunei. Cox (2006) reported low numbers in most rivers and creeks in Brunei Bay (relative density of 0.33 individuals/km). Habitats are largely undisturbed so the biological potential for recovery exists if incentives for the local human population to accept increased numbers of crocodiles can be provided (Ibrahim and Cox 2006). There have been eight confirmed attacks by <em>C. porosus </em>on humans since 2006 (CrocBite 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Cambodia</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles are considered to be extinct in Cambodia. It is believed that <em>C. porosus </em>were extirpated from Tonle Sap Lake about 30–50 years ago (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2006) although some individuals may still exist in coastal areas (Thuok and Tang 1994, Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2005, Ouk Vibol, pers. comm. 2017). Very few <em>C. porosus </em>are held on the 900+ crocodile farms in Cambodia (Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2005) with the local crocodile farming industry being based on the Siamese Crocodile (<em>C. siamensis</em>). Hybridization with <em>C. siamensis</em> is not a frequent occurrence (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>China</strong><br/>The presence of wild <em>C. porosus </em>in southern China is currently unknown. Farming operations on the mainland and on Hainan Island may still have some <em>C. porosus</em>, imported from range states such as Thailand (Chen 2001, Geng 2001, Li 2001).<br/><br/><strong>India</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles remain in the northeast coastal region of mainland India and the Andaman Islands (Kar 2013, Singh and Kar 2006). A “rear and release” program in Bhitarkanika National Park (BNP), Odisha State, has released more than 2,950 captive-reared juveniles (approximately 1 m long) between 1977 and 2015 and several released females are known to be nesting successfully (Kar 2017). As such, the <em>C. porosus </em>population in BNP has increased significantly since the reintroduction program started from 95 sightings in 1976/77 (relative density= 0.87/km) to 1682 sightings in 2017 (relative density= 13.4/km; Kar 2019). The number of nests has increased from five in the mid-1970s, to 65 in 2009, 70 in 2017, to 101 in 2019 (Kar 2009, 2017, 2019). BNP is considered to comprise around 75% of the total population of wild <em>C. porosus </em>in India (Kar 2019).<br/><br/>The population increase in BNP has led to increased dispersal and HCC (Padro and Padhi 2019). A team of crocodile husbandry and management staff at the Dangmal/Bhitarkanika Research Facility are now engaged to capture problem <em>C. porosus </em>and relocate them back to suitable locations within BNP (Anon 2008a). Previously, groups of captive-bred C. porosus were released by the Forest Department in the southern-most part of BNP, primarily as a deterrent strategy for human activities in the mangrove forest (Kar 2007).<br/><br/>Concerns about the potential impact of the Dhamara seaport and Rengali canal developments on BNP and its <em>C. porosus </em>population were raised previously (see Webb <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, Dhamara seaport has now been in operation since 2010 and does not appear to have had a detrimental effect on the crocodile population or its mangrove habitats. Studies conducted by government and non-government agencies on the impact of the Rengali Dam (upstream Brahmani River) on the flow of fresh water also highlighted negligible impact on mangrove ecosystems, including those in BNP, and at present there appears to be sufficient freshwater flow from both the Brahmani and other rivers (e.g. Baitrani and Kharasrota Rivers).<br/><br/>In the Indian portion of the Sundarbans in West Bengal, daytime surveys in January 2012 reported a relative density of 0.11 non-hatchlings/km (1,163 km), with a bias towards adults (49.3%) although this is typical of daytime surveys and is not considered to reflect the real population size structure (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2012). As of March 2012, more than 450 <em>C. porosus</em> had been bred at the Forest Department of West Bengal’s farm in the Sundarbans and released into the wild (Nagchoudhury 2012).<br/><br/>Although <em>C. porosus </em>are known to be widely distributed in areas with suitable breeding habitat (freshwater swamps), there are no recent data on the status of <em>C. porosus </em>in the Andaman Islands (Whitaker and Whitaker 1978, Andrews and Whitaker 1994). Human occupation is considered to be displacing crocodiles (Andrews and Whitaker 1994) and HCC is an increasing problem (Whitaker 2008, 2009; Giles 2015) that threatens tourism, which is the biggest industry in the islands. A review of management options for the Andaman Islands was conducted in July 2018 (G. Webb, pers. comm. 2018). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Indonesia</strong><br/>An extensive survey program was conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Indonesian CITES Management Authority (PHKA - Direktorat Jenderal Perlindungan Hutan dan Konservasi Alam) in the 1990s, but it did not provide an estimate of the total population of <em>C. porosus </em>within Indonesia, nor its distribution across the archipelago nation (CITES 1994). The stronghold for <em>C. porosus </em>is West Papua and Papua Provinces, particularly the Mamberano River drainage in the north. Past human exploitation and habitat alteration have reduced the population of <em>C. porosus </em>throughout much of Indonesia, although localities in Sumatra and the extensive rivers and lowlands of Kalimantan clearly support wild populations. With the exception of Papua and West Papua Provinces, captive breeding and ranching (subject to approval and population monitoring) of <em>C. porosus </em>is permitted elsewhere in Indonesia (e.g. Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi). In July 2007, there were 15 registered farms in Indonesia (Manolis 2007, Manolis and McInnes 2007), but the number is now reduced. The last intensive review of crocodile conservation and management in Indonesia was in the early 1990s (Webb and Jenkins 1991), although some aspects of management were dealt with by a IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group (CSG) mission in 2014 (Brien <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Despite a self-imposed hunting moratorium between 1994 and 1996, it seems that by 1997 many crocodile farms in Papua Province had stockpiles of wild <em>C. porosus </em>skins collected during this time. Based on these stockpiles, the management plan was revised in 1997 to allow ranching (Directorate General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation 1997) (H. Kurniati, pers. comm. 2009). A system of ranching (juveniles) and wild harvest (sub-adults), similar to that established in neighbouring Papua New Guinea, is now well established in West Papua and Papua Provinces.<br/><br/>Annual export quotas are established by the Indonesian CITES Scientiﬁc Authority (LIPI - Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia) based on monitoring results, and the CITES Management Authority (PHKA) regulates the quotas. Spotlight surveys, which form the basis for monitoring the wild <em>C. porosus </em>population (Kurniati and Rumbarar 1999), were not undertaken between 1998 and 2008, and a zero export quota for the species was put in place. In 2007, it was reported that about 10,000 hatchlings were taken through ranching (H. Kurniati, pers. comm. 2009). Industry is also interested in an egg harvest, which was undertaken on a trial basis with the New Guinea Crocodile (<em>C. novaeguineae</em>) in the early 1990s under an FAO project (Manolis and McInnes 2007), but costs of collection in the remote swamps of West Papua and Papua Province have been prohibitive (H. Kurniati, pers. comm. 2009). Concerns have been raised that the harvest quotas in Papua Province could be increased and that the system of quota allocation between farms may not be equitable (Manolis and McInnes 2007). Although minimum and maximum size limits for wild <em>C. porosus </em>skins (25 cm and 51 cm belly width respectively) are established, large skins are still purchased illegally by buyers. It is difﬁcult for hunters to distinguish between the two species of crocodiles around the maximum size limit.<br/><br/>It is widely recognized that the crocodile industry in Indonesia (as in Papua New Guinea) is an important, and sometimes the only, source of cash income for many rural communities in remote areas. In 2015, 8133 skins were exported from Indonesia (Caldwell 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Malaysia</strong><br/>The Malaysian population of <em>C. porosus </em>was transferred to CITES Appendix II in 2016, mainly to allow the State of Sarawak to implement a wild harvest and ranching program to create incentives to address increasing levels of HCC (CITES 2016). A zero export quota for wild specimens of <em>C. porosus </em>currently applies to Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah.<br/><br/><em><strong>Peninsular Malaysia</strong></em>: Saltwater Crocodiles were considered relatively rare but are now sighted more regularly throughout Peninsular Malaysia (e.g. Klang River; Kwan 2017). Sebastian (1993) listed 10 localities where <em>C. porosus </em>had been reported and suggested that the Setui-Chalok-Bari basin on the east coast near Terengganu may contain the most signiﬁcant population, but this is yet to be conﬁrmed by surveys. A preliminary survey of <em>C. porosus </em>in Rembau Estuary in 2009 indicated a relative density of 2.9 non-hatchlings/km with the presence of hatchlings indicating successful nesting the previous season (Nazli and Hashim 2009). In July 2013, a large <em>C. porosus</em>, estimated to be around 6 m long, was found dead on the banks of the Kuala Selangor River at Bukit Belimbing, Kuala Selangor. A sack and plastic bag found in its stomach suggested that pollution may have been implicated in its death (Chen 2015).<br/><br/><em><strong>Sabah</strong></em>: Surveys of the <em>C. porosus </em>population have been undertaken irregularly over time in Sabah. Stuebing and Mohammed Sah (1992) surveyed the Klias River and found a small but viable population of around 50 individuals (hatchling-adult), while Cox and Gombek (1985) reported uniformly low densities throughout Sabah. Kaur (2006) reported that the relative density of <em>C. porosus </em>in the Segama River had increased from around 0.04 individuals/km in 1981 (Whitaker 1984) to 1.42 individuals/km in 2005. Stuebing (2002) reported a mean density of 1.1 non-hatchlings/km in Sabah rivers—22 times that reported by Whitaker in 1984 (0.05 non-hatchlings/km). A three-year state-wide survey program across 11 of Sabah’s largest rivers, selected on the basis of historical data and incidence of HCC, was completed in late 2019 to assess status and population trends. Preliminary results from six of those rivers indicated a mean relative density of 0.66 non-hatchlings/km; Luke Evans pers. comm. 2017). Notwithstanding that the preliminary mean density reported in 2019 is lower than that reported by Steubing <em>et al</em>. (2002), there is little doubt that the <em>C. porosus </em>population in Sabah has recovered signiﬁcantly over the last 20+ years. This is considered to be the result of a combination of legal protection (since 1982), a decline in the timber industry which decreased habitat/river disturbance, stabilization of oil palm estates and secondary growth along river banks, opening of closed canopy swamp and riverine forest, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation episode of 1997-98 which reduced ﬂooding of nests and led to high recruitment that year, and a dramatic decline in the harvest of wild crocodiles for skins during the late 1990s due to both lower prices and the implementation of CITES (Steubing <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>The increase in HCC in recent years (30 attacks in 2015–2019; CrocBite 2020) is of major concern to authorities (Webb 2008). Problem crocodiles have been captured and removed to farms (Look Fook Soon Trading, unpublished data), although some individuals are shot due to their proximity to human habitation. The current state-wide survey program will inform a new management plan to be drafted in 2020.<br/><br/><em><strong>Sarawak</strong></em>: Saltwater Crocodiles occur in most major rivers in Sarawak and large individuals are sufﬁciently common to be a serious threat to people. Surveys undertaken in the early 1980s found uniformly low densities of crocodiles throughout Sarawak (0.05 non-hatchlings/km; Cox and Gombek 1985) but recent surveys indicate that numbers have increased markedly since that time (CITES 2016). Surveys conducted in 2012–2014 indicated densities of 0.68 non-hatchlings/km (Sarawak Forestry Department) and 0.83 non-hatchlings/km (Sarawak Forestry Corporation), and the population was estimated to be around 12,000–13,500 individuals (CITES 2016). Sarawak is currently implementing the “Management Plan for Estuarine Crocodile (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>) in Sarawak 2016–2020” which includes removal of problem crocodiles, population surveys and monitoring, wild harvest and ranching, and community-based ecotourism and research.<br/><br/>The size structure of the population, with a high proportion of large individuals, is considered to have contributed to high rates of HCC. Attacks on humans in Sarawak have increased over time (1980–1999: 1.85/yr; 2000–2009: 4.3/yr; 2010–2017: 8.5/yr; CrocBite 2018; Lading 2004) leading authorities to undertaking culling operations in areas where fatal attacks have taken place. In May 1992, a notorious and distinctively marked (white back) C. porosus, Bujang Senang, was killed after 30 years in which it is reported to have eaten 13 people (Ritchie and Jong 1993).<br/><br/><strong>Myanmar</strong><br/>Once widely distributed throughout all coastal areas, <em>C. porosus </em>is now largely restricted to the lower Ayeyarwady (= Irrawaddy) River, and coastal Rakhine and Tanintharyi states. The only viable population is in Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary (MKWS) and adjacent forest reserves of the Ayeyarwady Delta, where nesting and recruitment were documented in 1999 (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2000; 2003; 2006). The sanctuary was resurveyed in January 2017 and the numbers were comparable to the 1999 survey (S. Platt <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). It is speculated that this population may function as a source population for coastal regions in southern Myanmar, including offshore islands in the Myeik Archipelago and one of the only significant populations of <em>C. porosus </em>remaining on mainland southeast Asia. Reports of crocodile attacks (CrocBite 2018) indicate that C. porosus is present in the Myeik Archipelago, albeit at low densities. MKWS could also be the source of crocodiles that recently turned up near Phuket Island, Thailand.<br/><br/>Platt <em>et al</em>. (2015) surveyed Lampi Marine National Park in the Tanintharyi region of Myanmar and found no evidence of an extant crocodile population, although it harboured a population of <em>C. porosus </em>as recently as the 1990s. Local extinction is attributed to direct persecution, egg harvesting (for domestic consumption and sale), and capture of crocodiles to sell to buyers from crocodile farms in Thailand. The park appears to be a potential site in which <em>C. porosus </em>could be reintroduced. It is also possible the island group could be recolonized by crocodiles dispersing from MKWS or elsewhere on the mainland.<br/><br/>A small population of approximately 20 <em>C. porosus </em>is known to occur in Ban Pone Chaung, a mangrove wetland on the mainland near Ywa Thit Village in the southern Tanintharyi region (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2014). A few crocodiles reportedly still occur in the Tanintharyi River, although these probably do not constitute a viable population (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2012). Other small populations of questionable viability are rumoured to be scattered along the coast from Ywa Thit northwards to Myeik but have not been formally confirmed (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Hatchlings from the MKWS were collected for captive rearing and 68 were released back to the wild when up to 1.2 m long between 1998 and 2001 (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). A farming-ranching program was implemented by the government in 1978 and the first farm (Thaketa Crocodile Farm) established in 1979 (Aung Moe 1994). Juvenile C. porosus collected from the wild (4097 between 1978 and 1999) and captive-bred individuals (3,087 hatchlings between 1983 and 1999) were used to stock the farm. Exports were mainly of live animals to Thailand and Singapore but since 1990 there has been limited production. The farm remains in operation but continues to be poorly managed (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2013) due to a range of technical problems (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). Efforts to register it as a CITES captive breeding facility in early 2008 were unsuccessful. In 2013, the farm maintained 500-600 crocodiles, ranging in size from hatchlings to large adults. Hatching success is poor and may be related to the nutritionally inadequate diet of marine fish and fish skins (obtained from a nearby fish processing facility) provided to adult breeders.<br/><br/>During the 1970s, the Government of Cambodia presented three <em>C. siamensis </em>to General Nwe Win, the former ruler of Myanmar. The <em>C. siamensis </em>can no longer be accounted for, and it is unknown if these hybridized with the more numerous <em>C. porosus </em>in the farm. Platt et al. (2013) recommended Thaketa Crocodile Farm concentrate solely on public education where it could make a significant contribution to regional crocodile conservation.<br/><br/><strong>Palau</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles were extensively hunted in Palau for their skins between the 1960s and 1980s. The ﬁrst systematic survey of crocodiles undertaken in 1991, by Messel and King (1992b), recorded 42 crocodiles in 112 km of waterways concentrated in two small populations at North Estuary on Belilou and Ngerdok Lake on Babeldaob. Brazaitis <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated the total population to be 500–750 individuals from a survey in 2003. The Bureau of Marine Resources has run a crocodile program since 2004 and conducted surveys between 2005 and 2008. The most recent surveys revealed relative densities of 0.41 to 1.48 individuals/km in coastal mangrove habitat, and 0.41 to 2.81 individuals/km in creeks with the majority of individuals estimated to be 0.6–3.0 m total length (J. Eberdong pers. comm 2008). The available survey results suggest that the population has not increased signiﬁcantly since the early 1990s but is probably stable. However, interviews with 46 past and present crocodile hunters in 2002/2003 suggested that there were more crocodiles than there had been historically (Matthews 2003, 2005).<br/><br/>There have been two crocodile attacks reported in Palau, the first in 1965 and the most recent in 2012 (CrocBite 2018). The Palau program focuses on ‘problem’ crocodile complaints and public awareness, with 21 problem crocodiles reported between 2005 and 2008, mostly from the north of the country (J. Eberdong, pers. comm. 2009). A few adult <em>C. porosus </em>were maintained in captivity in Koror, which have produced captive-bred hatchlings that have been released back into the wild. The success of reintroduction remains unknown.<br/><br/>Despite concerns about the genetic integrity of <em>C. porosus </em>in Palau due to past importation of different crocodile species (New Guinea Crocodile: <em>C. novaeguineae</em>; Philippines Crocodile: <em>C. mindorensis</em>, and American Alligator: <em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>; Brazaitis <em>et al</em>. 2009), an analysis of 39 blood samples from wild <em>C. porosus </em>conﬁrmed no hybridization (Russello <em>et al</em>. 2007). A CSG review in 2005 highlighted the fact that crocodiles are not currently protected by law, and that the public generally “dislike” them and consider them pests (Anon 2006). At times, crocodiles are killed and eaten as food but are not thought to be detrimental to their numbers.<br/><br/><strong>Papua New Guinea<br/></strong><em>Crocodylus porosus</em> is widely distributed throughout the lowlands of Papua New Guinea and on the islands of New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville and Manus. Current management of the wild population involves ranching (eggs, hatchlings, juveniles) and wild harvest (with size limits to protect breeding stock). A monitoring program has included regular nest surveys of representative habitats in the middle Sepik River since 1982 with a review of the program carried out in 1995 and subsequent revision of nesting indices (Manolis 1995). Nesting surveys indicate that the <em>C. porosus </em>population in the Sepik River is healthy and increasing at a rate of 2.4% p.a., with greater than 70 nests detected annually from 2003–2014 across 12 primary sites (Solmu <em>et al</em>. 2014). This increase has been attributed in part to a conservation awareness campaign and conservation incentives generated from an expanded <em>C. porosus</em> egg harvest (Wilken and Langelet 2004, Sine and Kula 2006, Solmu <em>et al</em>. 2014). The increasing involvement of local communities in the egg collection program has helped turn a HCC problem into an economic opportunity that supports the conservation of <em>C. porosus </em>(Solmu <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, increasingly strict skin grading standards in the international market have resulted in reduced purchases of ranched juveniles by farms leading to a reduction in price for wild skins, and thereby threatening the incentives that have been created in some remote areas through the program (E. Langelet, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Introduced ﬁsh (Pacu: <em>Piaractus brachypomus</em>, Java Barb (Java Carp): <em>Barbonymus gonionotus</em>) continue to degrade nesting habitats (Cox <em>et al</em>. 2006, G. Solmu, pers. comm. 2018) although other factors (e.g. climate change) may be implicated. Consideration is currently being given to size and quality of current remaining habitats, land tenure and land use, presence of other fauna and expansion (data collection) into new areas in which the Sepik Wetlands Management Initiative (formed in 1998) is working.<br/><br/>Given the very large area of inaccessible and undeveloped habitat, and the incentives for local traditional landowners to maintain crocodiles, <em>C. porosus </em>appears secure in Papua New Guinea. Reports from New Britain suggest that increasing numbers of attacks on people and livestock were due to increasing numbers of <em>C. porosus </em>(PNG National Newspaper, 28 August 2009). However, attack data reported by CrocBite (2017) for the country as a whole suggest that the frequency of attacks by <em>C. porosus </em>has remained somewhat stable over the last 15 years (5.6 per year; range 1 to 11).<br/><br/><strong>Philippines</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodile populations and habitats are reduced throughout the Philippines, and no large populations of <em>C. porosus </em>remain (Ortega <em>et al</em>. 1994). Today they exist as a few single individuals, small groups, and some iconic populations scattered through remaining wetland habitats. Areas with the highest numbers of <em>C. porosus </em>are thought to be on the island of Mindanao (e.g. Ligawasan Marsh), rivers and estuaries around southern Palawan, Sulu Archipelago in southwestern Philippines, northeastern Mindanao and some part of northeastern Luzon. A recent survey (Manalo <em>et al</em>. 2012) found evidence of basking areas that are potential nesting sites in the Agusan River basin, but no large viable population of <em>C. porosus </em>is known to exist. The connectivity of the islands of Palawan and Mindanao with the northeast coast of Borneo suggests a shared crocodile population.<br/><br/>The Balabac Group of Islands in southern Palawan had higher numbers of <em>C. porosus </em>compared to other areas in the Philippines. Recent population data derived from spotlight surveys at 17 locations reflects that the population in the southern portion of Palawan, at a density of 1.05 individuals/km, is higher than previously thought and the historical declines appear to be reversible. The populations of <em>C. porosus </em>in Sulu Archipelago, Zamboanga Peninsula and Siargao Island are still viable (R. Manalo, pers. comm. 2018), and locally protected. Surveys conducted in 2019 recorded the presence of <em>C. porosus </em>along the coast of southern Mindanao and in the coastal municipalities of Surigaodel sur Province, with high numbers in Tawi-tawi (1.78 individuals/km) in Sulu Archipelago. Although both <em>C. porosus </em>and <em>C. mindorensis </em>co-exist in Ligawasan Marsh, interviews with local residents in 2007 suggest that <em>C. mindorensis</em> is more commonly sighted than <em>C. porosus </em>(Pomares <em>et al</em>. 2009). To date, no surveys have been undertaken to quantify the abundance of either species in the area. The northern Sierra Madre National Park in Isabela also appears home to a small population of C. porosus (R. Manalo, pers. comm. 2018), which is threatened by killing as pests, by-catch in ﬁshing nets, and agricultural encroachment (Manalo 2004).<br/><br/>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the majority of the remaining wild adult <em>C. porosus </em>population on Palawan (141 individuals) and Mindanao (115 individuals) were caught or acquired from private collectors and relocated to the Crocodile Farming Institute, where they formed the nucleus of a captive breeding population. The progeny of these animals were later relocated to private establishments, some of which have begun commercial farming based on captive breeding (Mercado 2007). Captive-bred stock are thus available for reintroduction efforts in the future (Crocodylus Porosus Philippines Inc., pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Of 26 crocodile attacks in the Philippines in 2000–2015, 20 occurred in southern Palawan (Corvera <em>et al</em>. 2017) despite no evidence of an increasing crocodile population. Crocodiles that threaten the safety of people and livestock are usually killed, but in most cases crocodiles are afforded a level of protection by indigenous communities that still practice their cultural beliefs toward crocodiles and their habitats. In addition, continuous information and education campaigns throughout the species’ distribution are being conducted to strengthen human-crocodile coexistence (R. Manolo pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>In February 2007, a forum convened to address conservation, management and sustainable use of crocodiles in the Philippines (Anon 2007). This led to an exchange of information and experience between organizations in Luzon (Mabuwaya Foundation) and Mindanao (University of Southern Mindanao) (USM Crocodile Research Team 2007; Mabuwaya Foundation Inc. 2007), and closer collaboration with the crocodile farming industry (Crocodylus Porosus Philippines Inc.). In 2015, the Philippine Government reconstituted the Philippine Crocodile National Recovery Team (PCNRT), to be known as the National Committee for the Conservation of Crocodiles (NCCC). The NCCC developed the “Conservation and Management Plan for the Crocodile in the Philippines” that serves as a guiding framework for both species of crocodiles in the country. The key goals and strategies include the establishment of sanctuaries, enhancement of social understanding and acceptance, implementation of protocols in managing human-crocodile conflict, and effective monitoring and management of wild and captive populations (see Manalo and Mercado 2019). A second forum on crocodiles in the Philippines (theme: Strengthening Partnerships in Conservation Research and Sustainable Management of Crocodiles) was convened in March 2019 (Manalo and Mercado 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Seychelles</strong><br/>Crocodiles were noted when the first Europeans visited the Seychelles in 1609. Re-examination of skeletal material suggests that the species that occurred there at the time of European discovery was <em>C. porosus</em>, and not <em>C. niloticus </em>as previously assumed (Gerlach and Canning 1993). Europeans had extirpated the population by the early 1800s.<br/><br/><strong>Singapore</strong><br/>Considered to have been extinct in Singapore, Saltwater Crocodiles have been present and breeding in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (SBWR), on the northwest coast of Singapore, since around 2004 (H.C. Beng, pers. comm. 2017). The reserve is around 130 ha in size and was listed as an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2003. Given the high rate of local and international visitation to SBWR, the potential for HCC is of concern to authorities so barriers have been constructed along some walkways that are close to where crocodiles regularly bask to mitigate the HCC risk (H.C. Beng, pers. comm. 2017). CrocBite reports 26 attacks between 1842–1957 with the two most recent attacks in 1974 and 1989. Individual <em>C. porosus </em>have been reported in other parts of Singapore. The population was previously estimated to comprise around 15 adults but this number can vary from year to year, and in 2017 only 5–6 adult <em>C. porosus </em>were regularly sighted (H.C. Beng, pers. comm. 2017). The source of the <em>C. porosus </em>population in Singapore is considered to be Peninsular Malaysia, which is around 1 km from Singapore. One crocodile tagged with a location device by Singaporean authorities regularly travelled every few days between the two countries.<br/><br/><strong>Solomon Islands</strong><br/>The only vessel-based survey of crocodiles in the Solomon Islands was undertaken in 1989 by Messel and King (1990) who identiﬁed survey sites based on knowledge from local people and crocodile hunters. Suitable habitat is restricted by the terrain and further reduced by human occupation and agriculture. Most sightings were from three localities - Lauvi Lagoon (Guadacanal), Lake Tatae (Russell Islands) and Ghahirahobo (Santa Isabel). With the cessation of hunting for skins in 1989, the <em>C. porosus </em>population has increased, resulting in increased HCC and fatalities in different parts of the country. The situation has been exacerbated by the banning of firearms following civil unrest and the arrival of the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission (RAMSI) in 2003, such that local people were unable to deal with problem crocodiles themselves.<br/><br/>In 2018 (April–August), WorldFish in partnership with the Solomon Islands Government, conducted a nationwide survey of community knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward crocodiles (Van der Ploeg et al. 2019). The purpose was to obtain reliable information on the population status of saltwater crocodiles and the extent of HCC in the country. This would in turn be used to develop a management plan as identified in the Solomon Islands National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan 2016–2020. A total of 822 people (472 men and 350 women) were interviewed in 234 villages in seven provinces across the Solomon Islands. The knowledge of local people on the number of crocodiles in particular areas proved to be a robust way of estimating abundance. A total of 225 crocodile attacks on people were reported since 1998, 83 of which were fatal (37%) including 31 children. Over the past 10 years, on average, five people per year have been killed by saltwater crocodiles. Since the cessation of commercial hunting in 1993, the saltwater crocodile population has recovered rapidly. It is estimated that there are now between 1,400 and 2,300 non-hatchling Saltwater Crocodiles in the country, with breeding reported on every major island (Van der Ploeg <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>With more and larger saltwater crocodiles present, the number of attacks on people has and will continue to increase. Throughout the archipelago, communities are taking preventive measures to minimize the risks of crocodile attacks, with people emphasizing the need to supervise children, avoid fishing alone, and be alert at night and during floods. Flashlights are considered an effective tool to prevent a crocodile attack, and in many villages, crocodiles are killed by local hunters with traps and spears as a precautionary measure or in retaliation of an attack. Cultural restrictions on killing and eating crocodiles remain pervasive throughout the country. Crocodiles are widely regarded as taboo (sacred) animals that need to be treated with respect, with attacks often attributed to the wrath of ancestors or to sorcery (Van der Ploeg <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Sri Lanka<br/></strong>The status of <em>C. porosus</em> in Sri Lanka varies between locations, although how current abundance in different areas compares to historical abundance is unknown. The <em>C. porosus</em> population in Sri Lanka was estimated to be around 375 non-hatchlings in 1978, with the majority (70%) conﬁned to the southwest coast of the island (Whitaker and Whitaker 1979). More recently, Amarasinghe et al. (2015) conservatively estimated the <em>C. porosus </em>population to be around 2000 non-hatchlings, although field surveys are yet to support these numbers. An island-wide survey for crocodylians is underway and may shed light on more accurate and current population sizes in near future. A breeding population is known to exist in Muthurajawela Swamp (Devapriya 2004, Jayawardene 2004), although sporadic breeding is occasionally reported at other locations (e.g. De Silva and de Silva 2008, Gramentz 2008). Surveys in 2007-2008 in the Bentota River revealed a small breeding population, with the size structure strongly biased towards hatchlings (35 cm TL) and yearlings (&lt;70 cm TL: 93%; Gramentz 2008) which is indicative of a depleted population attempting to recover. Devapriya (2004) observed 20 individuals along a 2.8-km stretch of the Dandugam Oya, with 2-9 individuals in 1.7 km of adjacent marsh. <em>Crocodylus porosus </em>were also reported in the Madu Ganga (De Silva and De Silva 2008). De Silva (2008) reported an estimated population of 50 individuals in a 5 km stretch of the Nilwala River. Samarasinghe and Chandrasiri, (2013) reported a relative density of 5.1 individuals/km in Bellanwila-Attidiya Sanctuary in 2013. Hatchlings and juveniles have also been observed in Bolgoda Lake, Polwatte River, Matara River, Nilwala River, Walawe River, Hada Oya and Batticaloa lagoon (Samaringhe pers. comm 2020).<br/><br/>Major threats to the species include the destruction of eggs, killing, ﬁshing and habitat loss (eg urban encroachment, sand mining, conversion for tourism and agriculture) and pollution (De Silva 2008, Samarasinghe and Chandrasiri 2013, Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. 2015). Killing of crocodiles is sometimes “revenge” after attacks on humans but in some cases crocodiles are taken by villagers/fishermen as a source of meat (Madawala <em>et al</em>. 2013, Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. 2015). Local communities along the rivers use a variety of crocodile exclusion enclosures for bathing, washing, etc., in response to attacks by <em>C. porosus </em>(De Silva 2008). The current practice of relocating “problem” <em>C. porosus</em>, sometimes into Mugger (<em>C. palustris</em>) habitats, is not considered to be a good long-term strategy that is further exacerbated by authorities lacking expertise with regard to the capture and transport of crocodiles (Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Despite these anthropogenic impacts, the <em>C. porosus </em>population is considered to have increased significantly in Sri Lanka since the late 1970s (De Silva 2013). The total population was estimated to be around 375 non-hatchlings in 1978, with the majority (70%) conﬁned to the southwest coast of the island (Whitaker and Whitaker 1979). More recently, Amarasinghe <em>et al</em>. (2015) conservatively estimated the <em>C. porosus </em>population to be around 2000 non-hatchlings. <br/><br/><strong>Thailand</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles are effectively extinct in Thailand. Surveys in the early 1990s revealed sightings of one or two <em>C. porosus </em>on Phuket Island (Ratanakorn <em>et al</em>. 1994) but the majority of suitable habitat in this area has now been destroyed or occupied by people. Occasional reports of crocodiles such as by local ﬁsherman in the Ranong River, adjacent to the Myanmar border, and a report of a newly-hatched clutch in 2010 (TCMA 2013) suggest a few individuals may still exist. Temsiripong (2012) reported a small remnant population at Samaesarn Island on the southeast coast and two female <em>C. porosus </em>(2.43 and 2.5 m TL) were captured, marked and released in April 2012. Ao Bandon, the largest mangrove inlet on the east coast, may still support a number of <em>C. porosus </em>(Ngampongsai and Nabhitabhata 1987) but this remains to be confirmed. TCMA (2013) estimated the wild population of <em>C. porosus</em> to comprise around 200 individuals.<br/><br/>As of 31 December 2016, some 156,000 <em>C. porosus </em>were held in crocodile farms in the country (Manolis 2017), of which 16 were registered as CITES captive breeding operations at the end of 2017. Farms contain mainly <em>C. siamensis</em>, but hybridization between <em>C. siamensis </em>and <em>C. porosus </em>is well established.<br/><br/><strong>Timor Leste</strong><br/>The population status of <em>C. porosus</em> in Timor Leste is unknown but it is considered to have increased significantly since the country achieved independence in 2002. The largest population exists in Lake Iralalaro (Nino Konis Santana National Park, Posto administrative Lautém). In addition, various waterbodies, mainly lagoons and billabongs along the coast, contain crocodiles including Be Malae (Bobonaro), Ai Parapa, Hera, Christo Rei (all Dili), Naktuka and Citrana (all Oecusse), Loes (Liquica), River Irabere and Maurei, Waibani Waiwai, Rubinaha Wai, Matahoi, Luca (all Viqueque), Namalutu, Urunami and Lapalapa, Werukoco, Raumoco (all Lautém), Kasalac, Hasan Foun, Onu Bot, Beco, Raimea no Leolima, Tashilin and Raimea (all Cova Lima), Modomahut (Manufahi), Seical, Vemase (all Baucau), Ribeira Manatuto (Manatuto) and Bican Tidin (Ainaro) (Crocodile Task Force Timor-Leste 2017). <br/><br/>From 2007 to 2019, there have been 59 fatalities and 21 non-fatal attacks on people (CrocBITE 2019) but many are believed to go unreported. In response, the Timorese Government has set up warning signs at known crocodile spots and is regularly visiting affected communities to raise public awareness. Culturally, crocodiles are very important to local people and <em>C. porosus</em> is the national animal (Anon 2008b). There is some hunting of crocodiles for meat by coastal communities and some C. porosus are held in captivity in the capital, Dili. The Government has constructed a crocodile enclosure in Hera, near Dili, to enable the removal of problem crocodiles. Community-based monitoring was conducted in various communities in Lautém and Viqueque to assess data on crocodile habitat and attacks, integrating the knowledge of local stakeholders. Local authorities raised the concern that crocodiles dispersing from Australia could be responsible for the increase in crocodile attacks. Future research and management should focus on testing the dispersal hypothesis, and on the removal of problem crocodiles from areas where crocodile habitat and human activity frequently overlaps, as well as on developing an ecotourism strategy including “crocodile watching”.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Viet Nam</strong><br/>Saltwater Crocodiles persisted in southern Viet Nam and the Mekong delta until 20-25 years ago, but extensive habitat degradation and the direct capture and killing of crocodiles greatly reduced the wild population. By the mid-1940s no more than 100 <em>C. porosus </em>were thought to survive in the wild (Cuc 1994). No viable wild populations are known to exist today. A re-introduction and recovery program for <em>C. porosus </em>in remaining suitable habitat was proposed by a CSG review mission (Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2008) but no progress has been made to date. Very few <em>C. porosus </em>are on crocodile farms (Jenkins and Sung 1998, Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2008, H. Jenkins, pers. comm. 2018). Nonetheless, hybridization of <em>C. porosus </em>with either <em>C. siamensis </em>or <em>C. rhombifer </em>(imported into Viet Nam from Cuba in 1985) is a possibility (Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Vanuatu</strong><br/>The eastern-most population of <em>C. porosus </em>is recorded from eastern Vanua Lava in Vanuatu (New Hebrides and Banks Islands). The area was surveyed in 1992 by Messel and King (1992a), who concluded that crocodiles were on the verge of extinction there. Only two adult crocodiles were seen in the wild and the population was no longer breeding. In 2003, Australia Zoo was asked by the Vanuatu Government to capture and relocate a 3.6 m <em>C. porosus </em>from the heavily populated island of Maewo to Vanua Lava where it is believed to have originated. The population comprises perhaps 15–20 individuals that had recovered from a much smaller population after Tropical Cyclone Wendy in late 1972 (F. Hickey, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Other </strong><br/>Stray <em>C. porosus</em> have been encountered considerable distances from their normal range. For example:<br/><ul><li>In 1971, a 3.8 m <em>C. porosus </em>was captured in southern Pohnpei, Eastern Caroline Islands, around 1,360 km from the nearest population (Allen 1974, Buden and Haglelgam 2010).</li><li>Around 1959, a 1.0–1.5 m long crocodile, assumed to be <em>C. porosus</em>, was killed at Eauripik Island, Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia. Although not reported in the literature, many residents sighted the animal after it was killed (Buden and Haglelgam 2010). In late 1986, another crocodile, also assumed to be <em>C. porosus</em>, was reported from Woleai Atoll, Yap State (Eldredge 1994, Buden and Haglelgam 2010).</li><li>Takashima (1955) reported three crocodiles from Japanese territories; one from Iwo Jima (in 1744), one from Amami- Oshima at the northern end of the Ryukyu Islands (in 1800), and a third from Toyama Bay, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. All three were presumed to be <em>C. porosus</em>.</li><li>A vagrant crocodile was reported on Nauru Island, 1,160 km from the nearest <em>C. porosus </em>population (Webb 1994).</li><li>In October 2004, an individual <em>C. porosus </em>was captured in the Marshall Islands, some 2,000 km from the nearest <em>C. porosus </em>population in Papua New Guinea (Manolis 2005).</li></ul>The first reported <em>C. porosus</em> captured in the Maldives was in 1998, and the animal was placed in a local zoo (Ali 2015). In 2007, a crocodile, assumed to be <em>C. porosus</em>, was captured, and in April 2009 suspected crocodile tracks were investigated at Gaafu Alifu Atoll (Anon 2009). In January-February 2015 more than 10 saltwater crocodiles were reportedly sighted (Ali 2015), and a 3.1 m individual was captured near L. Isdhoo (Fayaz 2015). The closest population of <em>C. porosus </em>is in India, some 430 km away (Bindloss 2015).",Stable,"<p></p>The Saltwater Crocodile (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>) currently occurs in: Australia; Bangladesh; Brunei Darussalam; India; Indonesia; Malaysia; Myanmar; Palau; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Singapore; Solomon Islands; Sri Lanka; Timor Leste; and, Vanuatu. The species previously existed in Cambodia (possibly extinct); Seychelles (Extinct); Thailand (possibly extinct); and Viet Nam (possibly extinct). <br/><p></p>","<p></p>Saltwater Crocodile populations are legally protected in most range states, but protection alone may be ineffective. Management programs based on sustainable use (ranching, wild harvest, captive breeding) have been successfully implemented in Papua New Guinea, Australia and Indonesia, the three countries that contain the majority of the global population of the species. The possibility of establishing sustainable use programs in Malaysia and the Solomon Islands are being explored.<br/><br/>Farming of <em>C. porosus</em>, based on captive breeding, is undertaken in Bangladesh, China, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Stock produced through captive breeding is supplemented significantly through ranching programs (eggs, hatchlings and/or juveniles) in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Ranching is not possible in much of the former range of <em>C. porosus </em>because wild populations are severely depleted or extinct. In 2015, there was approximately 71,000 <em>C. porosus </em>skins traded internationally (Caldwell 2017).<br/><p></p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><strong>The IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group (CSG) Action Plan (Webb <em>et al</em>. 2019), has proposed the following conservation actions for <em>C. porosus </em>as high priorities.<br/></strong><br/>1. <strong>Status surveys:</strong> Current quantitative and qualitative assessments of the current status of wild <em>C. porosus </em>populations in the majority of range states are lacking. In particular, priorities should be (in alphabetical order) Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Palau, Timor Leste, Indonesia (outside Papua Province) and Viet Nam.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Management Programs:</strong> Once populations have been assessed, management plans are required, dependent upon survey findings, and designed specifically for the (sub) region. For some populations, the conservation problem appears to have been largely solved (depleted populations are now increasing) but as a consequence HCC may also be increasing. If realistic management programs, tailored to local circumstances, are not developed and implemented, there will be no public or political tolerance for the expanded population. While removal of problem crocodiles combined with public education have been successful historically, research into alternative strategies and innovations is now required to reduce the threat to humans.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Sustainable use programs:</strong> These programs have, in the past, proved to be a conservation success in recovering the Australia and Papua New Guinea <em>C. porosus </em>populations. However, probability of success depends on many factors including international skin market price fluctuations and the capacity of government regulation. An example where ranching may be of benefit is in Sarawak and Sabah (Malaysia) where farming operations are already established, so ranching would provide an avenue for indigenous investment. However, before this can be considered, surveys need to inform the degree to which any harvest could be sustainable.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Review of crocodile management in Indonesia: </strong>Population monitoring of <em>C. porosus </em>in Papua and West Papua Provinces has not been undertaken since 1998 (Kurniati and Rambarar 1999). Although wild harvest quotas have been reduced because of no survey data, the allocation of the quota among licensed farms is of concern to some operators (see Manolis and McInnes 2007). The regulatory system may beneﬁt from external review by the CSG or other competent groups. Protection is nominally afforded to <em>C. porosus </em>in areas other than Papua Province (CITES 1994) but it seems ranching is occurring in Sumatra, Kalimantan and perhaps other locations. If so, it needs to be sanctioned by CITES, through a proposal to the CITES Secretariat.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Increased regional cooperation in Southeast Asia: </strong>The close association between production and trade in crocodilian products (including <em>C. porosus </em>but mainly <em>C. siamensis</em>) between Cambodia, Viet Nam, Thailand and China indicates that management, conservation and regulatory activities need to be coordinated in this sub-region (see Jelden <em>et al</em>. 2005; 2008). Technical exchange (e.g. training), surveys, development of management programs and mutually supporting regulatory structures (e.g. enforcement, Customs) are recommended.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Crocodile conservation program in India:</strong> An evaluation of restocking and the identiﬁcation of additional release sites are in need of review. There is an excess of animals now in captivity and insufﬁcient release sites for them. The issue of HCC in Bhitarkanika National Park and adjacent areas needs to be assessed in view of the increasing attacks on local people.<br/><p></p>",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Total population size and population trend are unknown. However, population size is likely relatively small given a highly restricted range. Localized stressors, including the diversion of untreated wastewater into the spring, conversion of springheads for recreational use and associated solid waste pollution, and cattle grazing on immediately adjacent land have resulted in a continued decline in the area, extent, and quality of habitat. Given an Extent of Occurrence (EOO) that does not exceed 100 km<sup>2</sup>, an Area of Occupancy (AOO) that does not exceed 10 km<sup>2</sup>, and one location based on the scope of threats, <em>G. eurystoma</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered.

Use of adjacent land in cattle grazing has significantly altered the riparian buffer zone and spring outflow (Tobler and Platt 2009, Culumber <em>et al</em>. 2016). Agricultural runoff from surrounding sugar cane and palm oil plantations may pose additional threats (Culumber <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Given the highly restricted range of <em>G. eurystoma</em>, these threats have to potential to adversely impact total population size and population trend in a relatively short amount of time.</p>","<p>The total population size of <em>G. eurystoma</em> is unknown, but likely relatively small given its highly restricted range.

For Olive Ridleys, as with other sea turtle species, as it is not possible to survey mature individuals we used an index of abundance in the form of the number of annual nesting females. Although not all females breed every year (see section on Reproduction below) and males are not evaluated, this index is considered to be the most reliable estimator for long-term population trends of marine turtles since the proportion of the total number of females that nest in any given year and the sex ratio is believed to be fairly constant across time within and between subpopulations (Meylan 1982, Limpus 1996).<br/><br/>Direct counts of the number of nesting females (NF) are not always available so we also relied on alternative information that can be converted to NF: number of nests per season, nests/km/yr or number of protected nests per season; annual estimates of hatchling or egg production, or census estimates of nesting females from arribada rookeries. When these proxies were used, the counted units were converted to NF based on the following constants: 105 eggs/nest and 2.5 nests/season/female. Some conservation programs reported annual number of protected nests but did not include the quantity of poached or otherwise destroyed or predated nests. For these cases we extrapolated to the total number of nests based on local estimates of conservation efficiency. All conversions to NF were made under the assumptions that (a) the mean number of eggs/nest and the number of nests/female/season do not differ significantly over the timescales we have used; and (b) the effort and the coverage of the biological parameters we used are reasonably constant through the time frame evaluated. In cases where the different surveys involved different levels of coverage, explicit corrections were made and specified in the result tables.<br/><br/>In spite of the Olive Ridley being the most abundant sea turtle, available quantitative information is extremely scarce and unevenly distributed across regions. We thus relied on a subset of the world’s rookeries which, we assume, exhibit population trends that are representative of the population as a whole or, at least, for each of the regions. We selected 28 Index Sites (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below) for which reasonably long time series of quantitative data are available. They include all the largest known populations, as well as an assortment of smaller rookeries from almost all of the regions where the species is found. All sites are assumed to be demographically independent. However, although genetic data indicate a high degree of inter-rookery migration between some rookeries (e.g., Brazil-Suriname- Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (1998); between México to Central America in the Eastern Pacific- Briseño-Dueñas (1998)) the results reflect events within an evolutionary timescale (many generations). Within the time span relevant to the assessment (two to three generations), available evidence suggests significant demographic independence between the pairs of rookeries in question (e.g., mark-recapture in Nancite and Ostional indicate the vast majority are different turtles- reviewed by Bernardo and Plotkin (2007); absence of exchange by tagged turtles and non-overlapping nesting seasons Brazil vs Suriname/French Guiana- de Silva et al. (in press); and the lack of re-colonization of depleted arribadas in Jalisco and Guerrero in México by the very large Escobilla rookery, 500 to 1,000 km distant in over four decades).<br/><br/>The population abundance estimates were based on raw data or on extrapolations from regressions performed on available data. As the relatively data-rich trends consistently indicated exponential trajectories we relied on these as the method of choice for extrapolations. Some data sets contained a number of trajectories across the time frames employed and in these more than one regression was employed or a combination of regressions and raw data. We have constrained our back extrapolations to time spans close to known historical events that are believed to have defined major abundance changes in order to avoid gross exaggerations with no supporting evidence. This has, however, meant that in some cases the extrapolations have only been performed back two generations (40 years) and could be considered underestimates of decline.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the assessment process</span><br/>Calculations based on very different datasets obtained by different workgroups, using multiple survey methods and spanning many decades are fraught with uncertainties. A number of these could be biasing our assessment. (1) Combining abundance information for individual rookeries obtained with a number of different methodologies could provide a source of error. However, we believe that the magnitude of these errors is of minor significance to the final declines estimated. (2) Because of the assessment’s requirement for quantitative information, a very small proportion of the total known rookeries were included, and some regions are not well represented. The bias this introduces is further augmented since it is most likely that rookeries having long time series of data are also the most monitored and hence the better protected. In this case the estimates of decline will be underestimated relative to the true trends for the more numerous and less well monitored/protected rookeries. This is likely the case for regions with little (Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean) or no (entire Eastern Atlantic) representation in our assessment that contribute very little to our global decline values yet where reports with qualitative evidence indicate extensive population declines (reviewed by Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Nonetheless, although ideally a global assessment should incorporate full data from all regions to derive robust evaluations, the available information on the geographic distribution of abundances suggests that the largest rookeries are concentrated in regions with good representation and thus their inclusion will not significantly affect the global results. This is reflected at the regional level and in results for non-arribada rookeries where our sample bias will probably have caused an underestimation of true decline levels. (3) The extent of extrapolations into time past is an aspect that will undoubtedly contribute to the uncertainty of the results, particularly with scarce information. We have avoided extrapolating far beyond the oldest datasets to avoid this type of errors and thus consider that our results are conservative.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Rationale for the Red List Assessment</span>:<br/>In spite of scarcity in historical data, information from diverse sources has made it possible to evaluate a global decline for this widely distributed species over time periods ranging from decades to 2-3 generations. Striking regional differences are observed in the estimations that undoubtedly indicate far lower survival probabilities in some of the regions than what the global results would suggest.<br/><br/>There was also a stark and recurring contrast between the decline estimates for subpopulations grouped according to breeding strategy- arribada or non-arribada (solitary). The global decline rate estimated from non-arribada subpopulations (-63 to -83%) reflects a widespread low conservation status for these types of subpopulations that suggests they haven’t recovered to historical (pre 1960) levels even in regions with long-term protection programs (e.g., over four decades in México) in spite generalized increments over the last decade (Márquez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). This needs to be highlighted because rookeries with non-arribada behavior are many times more numerous than those that nest as arribadas (e.g., in México about 98% of Olive Ridley subpopulations are non-arribada). Yet, as their abundances are up to three to four orders of magnitude smaller than arribada rookeries, they have an insignificant influence on the global decline estimates. In fact, the global net decline for the Olive Ridley is driven principally by population trends in just two arribada populations, Escobilla (México) and Ostional (Costa Rica), both in the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>The global decline value estimated on the basis of estimated population reductions of the annual number of Olive Ridley nesting females at subpopulations in the Index Sites used ranged between 31 and 36% (see Table 3 in the Supplementary Material, see below). As most of the back extrapolations were limited to two generations it is likely that this value is conservative.<br/><br/>When deciding whether to apply Red List decline criterion A1 (the causes of reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased) or A2 (the causes of reduction may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible) to obtain decline thresholds for the listing process three characteristics of the species’ decline need to be analyzed (SPWG 2006): (1) is the reduction reversible?, (2) are the causes of the reduction identified and understood?, and (3) have the threatening factors ceased? Since the decline estimated is driven by result from arribada rookeries, the questions need to be addressed against what is known for these types of populations. While it would appear that the elimination of large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley for leather and local consumption has allowed for the stabilization of a significant portion of rookeries, particularly in the Eastern Pacific and in particular facilitated the growth of arribada rookeries such as Escobilla and Ostional, the population growth of Mismaloya, Tlalcoyunque and Chacahua in the same region and under similar conservation circumstances remain at reduced abundances well below an arribada category. This could indicate that under some circumstances, the reduction of arribada rookeries below a certain level can make it impossible or unlikely for it to recover an arribada behavior. The major cause for the reduction in the species is thought to have been the massive commercial over-exploitations, particularly in the Eastern Pacific. Furthermore, we do not yet fully understand nor are able to manage other stressors, some intrinsic or at least due to interactions between the overcrowding of growing populations that equally provoke dramatic declines in arribadas such as that of Nancite in spite of decades of protection (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Though commercial exploitation of Olive Ridleys for international markets has effectively been eliminated, at local levels significant factors continue to impact individual rookeries such as excessive egg exploitation (e.g., Isla Caña, Panama) or bycatch (such as in Orissa, India). These examples indicate that Olive Ridleys, under current circumstances, do not meet all of the conditions for A1 and hence should be evaluated under criterion A2.<br/><br/>Under A2, the decline estimations obtained for the Olive Ridley Turtle at a global scale correspond to the Vulnerable IUCN Red List threshold (a decline of &gt;30% but &lt;50%.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Like most other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys display a complex life cycle, which requires a range of geographically separated localities and multiple habitats (Márquez 1990). Females lay their nests on coastal sandy beaches from which neonates emerge and enter the marine environment to continue their development. They remain in a pelagic phase, drifting passively with major currents that disperse far from their natal sites, with juveniles sharing some of the adults’ habitats (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000) until sexual maturity is reached (Musick and Limpus 1997). Reproductively active males and females migrate toward coastal zones and concentrate near nesting beaches. However, some males appear to remain in oceanic waters and mate with females en route to their nesting beaches (Plotkin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). Their post-breeding migrations are complex, with pathways varying annually (Plotkin 1994) and with no apparent migratory corridors, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometers over large ocean expanses (Morreale <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), commonly within the 20°C isotherms (Márquez 1990). In the East Pacific, they are present from 30°N to 15°S and often seen within 1,200 nautical miles from shore although they have been sighted as far as 140°W (IATTC 2004). Western Atlantic Olive Ridleys appear to remain in neritic waters after breeding (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Demographic features / Reproduction</span><br/>The species displays three modes of reproduction: arribada, dispersed nesting, and mixed strategy (Bernardo and Plotkin 2007). The first mode represents a synchronous, mass nesting behaviour that may include hundreds to thousands of females over a period of days and occurs in fewer than a dozen places worldwide. The more common form of nesting is dispersed or “solitary” with no apparent synchronicity between individual events. At some localities, a mixture of these two forms of nesting can also occur. In general, individual Olive Ridleys may nest one, two or three times per season, with approximately 100–110 eggs per clutch (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995). For this assessment we have used an average number of 2.5 nests/female/season and 105 eggs/nest. In contrast to other sea turtle species, the reproductive cycle is nearly annual (over 60% of turtles nest every year; Márquez 1990). Solitary nesters oviposit on 14 day cycles whereas arribada nesters approximately every 28 days (Pritchard 1969, Kalb and Owens 1994, Kalb 1999). Kalb (1999) found that within a nesting season solitary nesters use multiple beaches for oviposition but arribada nesters display nest site fidelity. There are extreme variations in hatching rates between nesting beaches, however, in general they are much higher in solitary nesting beaches where around 80% is common and sometimes even higher (Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). It is widely recognized that survivorship is extremely low on high-density arribada nesting beaches because of density-dependent mortality (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991) leading to hatching rates as low as 1 to 8% (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Moreover, turtles return approximately every month during a discrete nesting season (three to six months) and nests that remained intact during the previous month are again at risk when new waves of turtles crawl ashore. On solitary nesting beaches, where density-dependent mortality is not a factor, hatching rates are significantly higher (Castro 1986, Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Post-hatching survivorship is unknown and there is no information available on recruitment rates. Presumably, like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys experience high mortality in their early life stages. Juveniles are believed to occur in similar habitats as the adults (i.e,. pelagic waters) where they forage on gelatinous prey such as jellyfish, salps and tunicates (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).","Like other long-lived species, Olive Ridleys are prone to population declines because of slow intrinsic growth rate in combination with anthropogenic impacts. These can accumulate over a protracted development through various life stages, multiple habitats (nesting beaches, migratory routes and pelagic foraging zones) and vast geographic expanses.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Targeted exploitation</span><br/>Egg harvest. Olive Ridleys and their eggs have been harvested, mostly unsustainably, worldwide. However, the current impact is difficult to evaluate because of other simultaneous factors such as incidental take in commercial fisheries. Nonetheless, there is documentation of recent egg use causing declines (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). From México to Colombia, Olive Ridley eggs have been and still are used for personal and commercial use (Lagueux 1989, Arauz 2000, Campbell 2007, Cornelius et al. 2007). Laws regulating turtle egg use vary among countries, and even where laws prohibit egg use, illegal use of Olive Ridley eggs is believed to be widespread because enforcement is either non-existent or insufficient. On unprotected solitary nesting beaches (most are unprotected), egg extraction often approaches 100%. Human use of turtle eggs for consumption and domestic animal consumption historically was widespread in the Indian Ocean and continues today largely wherever Ridleys nest (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Egg use has been reported in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Pakistan and Malaysia and is believed to have caused the decline of Olive Ridleys in these countries (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Even at monitored beaches a proportion of the eggs are still lost to poaching.<br/><br/>Directed take of adults. In the East Pacific, although Olive Ridley turtle fisheries are now closed, illegal take of adult turtles still occurs widely with an unknown level of impact. There is evidence that thousands of Olive Ridleys are still taken each year along the Pacific coast of México (Frazier et al. 2007). In the West Atlantic, the direct take of adults has diminished over time to negligible levels (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). In the Indian Ocean, the use of adult Olive Ridleys and their eggs for personal use has been and continues to be widespread (Frazier 1982, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), and market-driven harvesting of eggs and females from nesting beaches are considered the greatest threat (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Personal, subsistence use of adult Olive Ridley turtles is widespread worldwide (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Olive Ridleys and/or their eggs are used along the entire coast of West Africa (including Macaronesia) and sold in local and regional markets (Fretey 2001).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bycatch in fisheries</span><br/>The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys occurs worldwide in trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seines, gill net and other net fisheries and hook and line fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The impact of the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in fisheries has been well documented for some regions but not for others. In some locations where by-catch statistics are unavailable from fisheries, cause and effect has been used to implicate a fishery in the decline of Olive Ridleys. The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in the shrimp trawl fishery in the western Atlantic, is believed to be the main cause of the significant population decline observed there since the 1970s and currently the number of Olive Ridleys by caught in trawl fisheries off the coasts of Surinam and French Guiana is believed to be approximately a couple of thousand turtles annually (Godfrey and Chevalier 2004, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Gillnets and other fishing methods in this region also capture Olive Ridleys incidentally but to a lesser extent than shrimp trawl fishery (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Bycatch in trawl fisheries off Sergipe State in Brazil is considered the most pressing threat to that population (Thomé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the eastern Atlantic, the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys by commercial fisheries is thought to be a significant threat but very little systematic data is available (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental mortality of Olive Ridleys is worst along the coast of Orissa, India with arribada Olive Ridleys gathering to nest were fishing effort is high. Every year since the early 1980s, thousands or tens of thousands of Olive Ridleys have stranded dead on the Orissa beaches, presumably as a result of incidental capture in shrimp trawls (Pandav 2000). A gill net fishery also operates in the region and contributes to the ridley mortality along this coastline. Incidental capture in fisheries is also believed to be a serious threat in the eastern Pacific (Frazier et al. 2007) where Olive Ridleys aggregate in large numbers off shore from nesting beaches (Kalb <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Kalb 1999), but the information available is incomplete (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995, NMFS/USFWS 1998). Incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in this region has been documented in shrimp trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seine fishery and gill net fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a serious threat along the coast of Central America, with an estimated annual capture for all species of marine turtle exceeding 60,000 turtles, most of which are Olive Ridleys (Arauz 1996). Recent growth in the longline fisheries of this region are also a serious and growing threat to Olive Ridleys and have the potential to capture hundreds of thousands of Ridleys annually (Frazier et al., 2007). Bycatch of Olive Ridleys is high in Indonesian tuna long-lines and shrimp trawls although mortality appears to be low (WWF Indonesia, unpublished data).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitat impacts</span><br/>Degradation, transformation and destruction of natural conditions at nesting beaches from coastal developments continue to threaten the long-term survival of many Olive Ridley rookeries. Transformation of nesting habitat comes from the construction of new aquaculture ponds, fishing harbours and tourist facilities, as well as growth of existing coastal villages which are increasing in many parts of the world within the range of the Olive Ridley, particularly along the east coast of India (Pandav and Choudhury 1999) and in some zones in coastal México to Central America (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). These impacts contribute stress directly through the loss of nesting habitat or indirectly through changes in the thermal profiles of the beach, increased light pollution (Witherington 1992) and sewage effluents.<br/><br/>Global warming has the potential to impact the habitats and ecosystems of Olive Ridley populations worldwide (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Weishampal 2004) but the specific impacts are purely speculative at this time. Most accounts have focused on the impact of global warming on incubation temperatures of eggs, which influence the sex ratio of the embryos (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Diseases and predation</span><br/>Extremely little is known about diseases and their effects on Olive Ridley abundance. The only disease identified in the literature for Olive Ridleys is fibropapilloma, a herpes-virus found in sea turtles nearly worldwide (Herbst 1994). The incidence of fibropapilloma is not believed to be high in Olive Ridleys but has been observed in Olive Ridleys nesting in Costa Rica (Herbst 1994) and in México (Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). At some individual rookeries, the predation by wild pigs and/or feral dogs can be substantial (e.g., in the Andaman Islands; Andrews et al. 2001). Infestation of developing eggs by fly and beetle larvae can cause significant mortality of embryos. In an extremely worrying case, the beetle larvae (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Omorgus suberosus fabricius</span>) has become a plague in the world’s largest arribada rookery in Escobilla, México where it is provoking steep drops in the hatching efficiency of the clutches laid, from a typical 30% for this colony (Márquez 1990) to less than 5% in some areas (López-Reyes and Harfush 2000). When combined with the relatively low hatching rates of high-density arribada beaches and the destruction of eggs laid by previous nesters, this problem could provoke the rookery’s decline.","<p>For the purposes of Red List assessments, generation length is defined as the “average age of parents” (IUCN 2001). Since this information is not available from direct observation of sea turtle species we derived a comparable value from estimates of age at which 50% of the breeders are expected to have survived, using information for age at sexual maturity and adult survival rates. An important caveat is that, while it is known that different populations of the same species can attain sexual maturity at different ages (Heppell <em>et al.</em> 2003) and therefore different values would need to be taken into account for different regions, the information is only available for a single region and we have had to assume the estimated values are generally applicable on a global scale. The only published study on growth and age for Olive Ridleys (Zug <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates a mean age at sexual maturity for North-central Pacific Ridley sea turtles of around 13 years (range of 10-18 years). We calculated the time it would take for a cohort of breeders to reach 50% of its original size from S<sup>n</sup> =50%, where <span times="""" new="""" roman="""">n is years since age at first reproduction, and S is annual survival. Solving for n, n = ln(0.5)/ln(S). As extensive estimates of annual survival rates for female nesters are only available from the better studied sister taxon, <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em>, (TEWG 2000) we used these, which have a range of 85-92% per year. Thus, n<sub>50% </sub>= 4-9 yrs and our derived average age of female Olive Ridley parents is 17-22 years. We additionally assumed that this value would be the same for male parents. For simplicity, we have used a value of 20 yrs for the species’ generation length in this assessment.</p>",Decreasing,"The Olive Ridley sea turtle has a circumtropical distribution, with nesting occurring throughout tropical waters (except the Gulf of Mexico) and migratory circuits in tropical and some subtropical areas (Atlantic Ocean – eastern central, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, western central; Indian Ocean – eastern, western; Pacific Ocean – eastern central, northwest, southwest, western central) (Pritchard 1969). Nesting occurs in nearly 60 countries worldwide. Migratory movements are less well studied than other marine turtle species but are known to involve coastal waters of over 80 countries (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below). With very few exceptions they are not known to move between ocean basins or to cross from one ocean border to the other. Within a region, Olive Ridleys may move between the oceanic and neritic zones (Plotkin <em>et al.</em> 1995, Shanker <em>et al</em>. 2003) or just occupy neritic waters (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Most of the conservation actions on behalf of the Olive Ridley at national and international levels have been based on the species’ listing under the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Endangered </span>category in the IUCN Red List. As an Appendix I species under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) the international trade of skins from the species, which fuelled the large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley from the 1960s into the 1980s was effectively halted. Other relevant international instruments that list the Olive Ridley as threatened and hence obligate its conservation by member states include: the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC). CMS-promoted Memoranda of Understanding for the conservation and management of marine turtles and their habitats have been signed by the Olive Ridley’s range states in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (known as IOSEA) as well as in other regions such as the Atlantic Coast of Africa under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa where 21 out of 26 range states participate.<br/><br/>On the basis of the species’ classification in the IUCN Red List or in national endangered species lists, local legislatures of range states confer protection to the Olive Ridley. Although this sanctions law-enforcement, the implementation remains patchy at the global scale because of paucity in enforcement capabilities. Successful conservation has usually relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local and non-governmental organizations incorporating public outreach. Statutory use and enforcement of the Turtle Excluder Devices in the shrimp trawlers has also proven critical in some areas with high levels of interaction with this fishery.<br/><br/>Despite the legislative efforts to protect the Olive Ridley, human impacts continue to be significant. In some areas (such as West Africa and South East Asia), extensive monitoring needs to be implemented to identify regions and stressors requiring priority actions. Bycatch and illegal take particularly from the coastal, artisanal fisheries need to be evaluated through adequate on-board observer programs and properly addressed. The beetle infestation of the Escobilla rookery must be adequately evaluated and acceptable measures of biological control of the insect need to be implemented.

Historically the two species were harvested commercially for flesh and caviar, but no species differentiation was recorded in the landings data. <br/> <br/>Although some shortnose sturgeon may still be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are habitat related resulting from loss or degradation. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).   <br/> <br/>Shortnose Sturgeon stocks appear to be stable and even increasing in a few large rivers but remain seriously depressed in others, particularly southern populations. Previous Red Lists listed the species as Vulnerable. Since that earlier listing, a Recovery Plan has been developed and is being implemented and genetically distinct population segments have been identified. Although exploitation is no longer a serious concern, effects of habitat alteration and degradation and water quality (contaminant) concerns remain. Thus, the shortnose sturgeon should continue to receive a Vulnerable listing. This is based, in part, on an estimated population reduction of greater than 30% over the past three generations with some irreversible habitat losses and continued concern about impacts of pollutants and water-based development activities on population health. We also note extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals between rivers, from a few hundred or less in the Chesapeake Bay to perhaps 10,000 or more in the Hudson.","Shortnose sturgeon use of saltwater is generally amphidromous throughout most of the species' range, although far northern populations are anadromous (Kynard 1997). Spawning takes place in upper freshwater areas, while feeding (summering) and wintering occurs in both fresh and saline environments. This species typically spends its entire life history in the natal river and estuary and only rarely moves any great distance in near-coastal marine waters. There are no naturally land-locked populations of the species, but two rivers have populations that are segmented by dams.
<br/>
<br/>This species typically attains an adult size of 75–100 cm total length, though the maximum recorded size for a Canadian-caught female was 1.43 m and 23.6 kg (Dadswell <em>et al</em>. 1984).  Maximum ages determined for female and male shortnose sturgeon (again in Canada) were 67 and 32 years, respectively (Vladykov and Greeley 1963).  Prespawning migrations in northern populations are triggered by increasing water temperatures of 7–10°C, and during spawning, males are attracted to females by a female pheromone (Kynard and Horgan 2002a).  Spawning occurs at water temperatures of 7–15°C.  Spawning habitat is a substrate of rock or large gravel (usually rubble), and water depth during spawning is highly variable. Spawning suitability windows follow day length of 13.9–14.9 h, water temperature of 6.5–15°C, and river discharge that provides 30–120 cm/sec (mean 70 cm/sec) bottom velocity. All spawning windows must be open simultaneously for spawning to occur. Yearling shortnose sturgeon initiate the major dispersal that moves young fish to join older juveniles and adults in fresh or salt water foraging concentration areas. Yearling and older juveniles use the same summering and wintering habitats as adults (Kynard <em>et al</em>. 2000).
<br/>
<br/>In southern waters, shortnose males may mature in 2-3 years and females in 4-6 years. In northern portions of the range, maturation may not occur for 10-15 years (maximum). Spawning periodicity is poorly understood but in the northern part of the range, females are highly variable (2-9 years) and males spawn at 1-5 year intervals depending on fish age and foraging conditions. Some males in northern populations spawn annually.","Although some shortnose sturgeon may be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are blockage of up- and downstream migrations at dams, habitat loss or degradation due to dams and dam operations, river channel dredging, and pollution. Southern populations are particularly at risk due to water withdrawal from rivers and groundwaters and from eutrophication that directly degrades river water quality causing loss of habitat. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).","The estimate of the total current population size for the Hudson River indicates a 95% confidence interval of 26,000 to 55,000 individuals. The Saint John, Kennebec, and Delaware subpopulations appear to be on the order of 5,000 to 15,000 fish each. Estimates of other northern populations are the Connecticut River (CT-MA) — about 1,200 fish, and the Merrimack River (MA) of less than 100 individuals (Kieffer and Kynard 1993, Kynard 1997, Savoy 2004). Though many rivers in the southern region have been documented to contain shortnose sturgeon, few have had population estimates conducted. Only abundance in the Ogeechee and Altamaha rivers of Georgia have been estimated and both appear to be on the order of 1,000 fish each (Rogers and Weber 1994). Shortnose sturgeon occur only rarely in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and no breeding population has been confirmed here.
<br/>
<br/>Walsh <em>et al</em>. (2001) analyzed shortnose sturgeon populations from two drainages in Maine and the Hudson River for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences between the Kennebec and Androscoggin stocks and even greater separation when compared to the Hudson stock. These data support the putative stock structure and distinct population segment designation adopted for shortnose sturgeon.",Decreasing,"Shortnose sturgeons occur in many of the large coastal rivers of eastern North America. From survey and tagging data, the National Marine Fisheries Service now recognizes 19 distinct population segments.

The largest populations in the northern region appear to be in the Saint John, NB, Canada (Dadswell 1979), Delaware, NJ-PA (Hastings <em>et al</em>. 1987), Kennebec, ME (Squiers <em>et al</em>. 1982), and Hudson, NY rivers (Bain <em>et al</em>. 1995).  <br/> <br/>See the <a href=""%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.natureserve.org/explorer/%E2%80%9C"">NatureServe Explorer</a> database for a more detailed description of this species’ range.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The shortnose sturgeon was listed as endangered under the inaugural U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1967.

A more detailed look at the data available for this species has resulted in it being downgraded to Least Concern. <br/> <br/>The lake sturgeon occupies the United States and Canadian waters of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River basin; Lake Champlain (Vermont-New York); the Lake Winnebago-Fox River complex (Wisconsin); Canada’s Hudson and James Bay watersheds; the Saskatchewan River (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba); and the Mississippi River basin area from the headwaters in Minnesota to the northern portion of the state of Louisiana and up the Missouri River into southern South Dakota. Well-regulated sport fisheries occur throughout the northern part of the range and Canada manages modest commercial fisheries in Ontario and Quebec provinces.  <br/> <br/>Although very little stock assessment is underway, the lake sturgeon subpopulation in the Mississippi and lower Missouri river basins is believed to be stable but relatively small, certainly compared to levels in the late 1800s prior to development of modern locks, dams and reservoirs. Area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and quality of habitats in this part of the species’ range are all diminished compared to historic conditions.  Restocking efforts using cultured fish are modest and fragmented among the states but results from Missouri DOC stockings are encouraging. Since there is currently no concerted basin-wide or interstate plan to manage or restore this stock, the Mississippi river basin lake sturgeon subpopulation is considered to be Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>The largest proportion of the global population lies in the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River basin areas where numerous management and recovery plans are in place among and between states and provinces sharing boundary waters. Most threats here are understood and essential conservation measures are being implemented. Populations of lake sturgeon are being monitored and assessed and most segments of the stock appear to be increasing. Based upon all of the above information and IUCN definitions, the species currently is not facing a threat to its survival and is categorized as Least Concern (LC).","Based on pectoral fin ray sections it has been determined that lake sturgeon can live to be over 100 years old. One individual caught in Lake of the Woods, Ontario in 1953 was estimated to be 152 years old (Priegel and Wirth 1971). Lake sturgeon can reach lengths of 1.9 m, and weigh 91 kg. However, a 141 kg lake sturgeon was reportedly caught in Lake Superior in 1922 and a fish of equal weight was caught in Lake Michigan in 1943. Most fish reported in the literature were less than 35 years old.
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon from Black Lake in Michigan measured 75–193 cm total length (TL) and were 9–64 years old, with most fish less than 20 years old (Baker and Borgeson 1999). In the Lake Winnebago system of Wisconsin, female lake sturgeon reach sexual maturity between 24–26 years of age when they are about 140 cm long. Females spawn only every 3–6 years and can produce up to 700,000 eggs each time. Few male lake sturgeon mature before they are 114 cm long or 14–16 years old. Males spawn every one or two years (Priegel and Wirth 1971, Lyons and Kempinger 1992). In the Sturgeon River of Upper Michigan, male spawning intervals of two, three and four years were observed while females returned to spawn every three to seven years (Auer 1999). In Canadian rivers and lakes, mature male lake sturgeon range in size from 76–98 cm and females 84–117 cm (Houston 1987). Compared to sturgeon from Lake Winnebago and the Great Lakes, relatively little information is available regarding age, growth, maturity and spawning periodicity of lake sturgeon in the Mississippi River basin.
<br/>
<br/>During the spring season, lake sturgeon spawning occurs when water temperatures rise and reach 9–15 °C (Priegel and Wirth 1971, Kempinger 1988).  Spawning sturgeon will select shallow areas over hard clean substrate with relatively strong current velocities (Kempinger 1988).
<br/>
<br/>Usual lake sturgeon habitat is the highly productive shoal areas of larger lakes and rivers. They require moderate to swift currents and large rough substrates for spawning and embryo development. Lake sturgeon in the Upper Mississippi River prefer habitat in or adjacent to flow, but with relatively low to moderate current velocity (Knights, B. C., USGS, unpublished data).  They are rarely found in backwater habitats without flow. In the Mississippi basin habitat that is in or adjacent to current is generally depositional and has relatively compact silt or silt-sand substrates with presumed high densities of benthic invertebrates. These areas occur at the lower end of navigation pools near the main channel, the mouths of tributaries and large secondary channels, and at some channel border areas. While migrating, presumably en-route to spawning habitats or high use (feeding/home) areas, lake sturgeon will use areas of the river with relatively high current velocities including tailwaters, the main channel in the upper and mid reaches of navigation pools, and tributaries.
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon are known to move great distances to spawning and feeding habitats (Auer 1996). Wisconsin DNR recently reported that a sturgeon originally tagged in Lake Winnebago in October 1978 was recovered almost 19 years later at Locust Point Reef in Lake Erie, a minimum travel distance of almost 1,100 km (R. Bruch, WI DNR, news release).","The life history characteristics of slow growth, late maturation, and irregular spawning periodicity make lake sturgeon subpopulations particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. Anthropogenic effects such as industrial and municipal pollution, blockage of access to habitats by dykes and dams, channeliszation and elimination of backwater areas, dewatering and water level fluctuations, physical destruction of spawning habitat, and inundation of habitat by reservoirs are known to threaten sturgeon subpopulations (Rochard <em>et al</em>. 1990, Auer 1996, Beamesderfer and Farr 1997, Noakes <em>et al</em>. 1999). Direct mortality of lake sturgeon due to impacts with commercial and/or recreational navigation vessels has been documented.  <br/> <br/>Dams may be the greatest impediment to lake sturgeon rehabilitation in the Great Lakes. Although there are numerous recorded instances of tagged sturgeon passing through navigation locks, many fish are precluded or delayed from reaching spawning or preferred feeding waters. Dams without locks completely block sturgeon passage and serve as severe impediments to lake sturgeon recovery in the Mississippi basin. Spawning and nursery areas are further degraded from land use problems such as erosion, sedimentation, and adverse discharges from point and non-point sources. Other concerns in the Great Lakes include stream channelization, over-exploitation and/or illegal harvest, lack of public concern and potential adverse impacts of lampricides on sensitive life stages.  <br/> <br/>Although lake sturgeon harvest from the Mississippi River is prohibited, financial incentive to collect roe for caviar remains. Small population sizes may limit poachers from targeting this species but it is likely that incidental captures are utilized and end up in the black market. With the first stocking of lake sturgeon by Missouri DOC now at age 17, there is increasing concern that poachers will target them as the females reach maturity within the next few years.","Lake sturgeon were, and in some cases continue to be, an important component of Native American diet and culture. Up until about 1870, lake sturgeon were primarily considered a nuisance by commercial fisherman and were stacked on the shores to rot (Milner 1874 cited in Becker 1983). Within the next 30 years the value of sturgeon for flesh and the use of roe for caviar became economically important. During heavy fishing years in the late 1800s lake sturgeon harvest from the Great Lakes averaged over 1,814 metric tons (mt) per year. In the peak harvest year of 1885, 4,901 mt were reported of which 2,359 tons came from Lake Erie alone. Sturgeon populations declined dramatically after 1900 and although some incidental harvest was reported until 1977, numbers were extremely low after 1956.
<br/>
<br/>Although lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes were greatly reduced due to overfishing during the last several decades of the nineteenth century they appear to be on the rebound throughout the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence basins with spawning populations being documented from 63 locations and spawning size estimates calculated for 17 of these sites.  The current status of lake sturgeon populations in most of the Great Lakes Basin, the St. Lawrence River and in Wisconsin’s Lake Winnebago system is stable or increasing. 
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon were generally considered to be rare to uncommon in most waters of the Mississippi River basin since the late 1800s. In 1989, this species was declared as threatened by the American Fisheries Society in all Mississippi River states except Louisiana where they are believed to be extirpated (Williams <em>et al</em>. 1989). The Department of Natural Resources in Iowa and Illinois and the Missouri Department of Conservation list the lake sturgeon as endangered in their respective states, and in Minnesota, the lake sturgeon is listed as a species of special concern. The species appears to be extirpated from its former range in Alabama and Arkansas.
<br/>
<br/>The current status of lake sturgeon throughout the Mississippi basin is considered to be severely depressed from historical abundance levels. However, modern population assessment studies are lacking and rate of stock decline or growth is unknown. Native stocks were extremely depressed prior to the stocking program undertaken by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Following the first releases into Mark Twain Lake (Salt River, a Pool 24 tributary) in 1984, then at Louisiana on Pool 24 of the Mississippi River and at several Missouri River locations in 1988, increasing reports of incidental catch in commercial gear and by recreational anglers has been occurring.",Increasing,"Lake sturgeon spend their entire life cycle in freshwater and are widely distributed in North America. They currently range throughout much of the drainages of the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, the St. Lawrence River, Hudson Bay-James Bay, and the Saskatchewan River (Pflieger 1975, Becker 1983, Ferguson and Duckworth 1997). In the Mississippi basin this species occurs from the headwaters in Minnesota to the northern portion of the state of Louisiana and up the Missouri River into southern South Dakota. There is no known natural exchange of stocks between the Great Lakes and western Canadian provinces and those of the Mississippi River basin, though some stockings in the Mississippi have included lake sturgeon of Great Lakes Basin origin.  <br/> <br/>For a more detailed description of this species’ range, see <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/"">NatureServe’s Explorer database</a>.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Commercial harvest of lake sturgeon is prohibited in all U.S. waters and strictly managed in Canadian waters with closed seasons, size limits and gear restrictions.  <br/> <br/>Angling in some waters of Michigan is allowed with several restrictions as to season, fish sizes and gear. In Wisconsin, harvest is limited to two separate sportfishing seasons. Spear fishermen must purchase a one-fish sturgeon spear tag and they are allowed to spear a fish from early February until a specified quota is reached. In Lake Winnebago, the 2000 quota was set at 400 adult females, 400 juvenile females and 2,150 males. Once 80% of the quota is reached the fishery is closed after the next day. Typical spear fishing harvest in recent years produced 1,500 to 2,500 fish. Wisconsin’s hook and line fishery allows the catch of one fish per angler per season with a minimum size range of 127–178 cm, depending on location, during early September through 15 October. All anglers must apply for and use a free tag and the fishery produces about 300–400 fish per season.  <br/> <br/>Sport fishing for lake sturgeon is currently prohibited in the Mississippi River but is allowed in some tributaries in Wisconsin and Minnesota (e.g., Wisconsin, Chippewa, and St. Croix rivers) during a short hook and line season in the fall.  Angling in Minnesota has several restrictions as to season, fish sizes and gear and the reported annual sport catch was 2,200–4,200 kg in 1998–2000.  Harvest is not allowed in Iowa, Ohio, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and South Dakota. <br/> <br/>According to the CITES Management Authority of Canada (CMAC 2000) sturgeon harvest in Canada consists of aboriginal, commercial and recreational fisheries. The entire North American commercial harvest of lake sturgeon comes from Canada where in 1997, 223 mt were caught in New Brunswick and Quebec, with 90% (200 mt) being taken from the St. Lawrence River. Catch in Ontario during the late 1990s ranged from 5–8 mt. Most of this came from Lake Huron with a small amount from Lake St. Clair. In 1998, international trade in lake sturgeon meat was reported to be 18.2 mt exported from Canada to the U.S. (mostly New York). No caviar exports are reported and no export quotas have been established by range states. Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans reported that in recent years total recreational catch from the North and South Saskatchewan rivers in Alberta and Saskatchewan amounted to about 1,000 fish. <br/> <br/><em>Acipenser fulvescens</em> is not listed as a species at risk by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Most subpopulations are thought to be capable of sustaining well-regulated fisheries. Although the species is managed and protected in Canada under the Federal Fisheries Act, regulations differ between provinces and are revised annually. This species is listed under provincial legislation as ""threatened"" in Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan (CMAC 2000). <br/> <br/>In recent years, interest in the restoration of lake sturgeon has increased greatly. Partnerships have been developed throughout the Great Lakes basin between state and federal natural resource agencies, commercial and sport fishers and other water users. Numerous management and recovery plans have been completed for select waters within the lake sturgeon range and are being implemented as resources allow. Their goals include conservation, rehabilitation and enhancement of sturgeon populations, completion of status assessments, harvest restrictions, identification and restoration of critical habitats and elimination of negative effects of dams.  <br/> <br/>Construction of spawning habitats using coarse stone rip-rapping has been undertaken in some states (particularly Wisconsin) and appears to be highly successful. Artificial culture and restocking of lake sturgeon is under development in Minnesota using wild broodstock. In New York, sturgeon eggs are taken from wild stocks in the St. Lawrence River and cultured fingerlings have been reared and released in several locations since 1995. Survival has been high and populations appear to be recovering. In Missouri over 210,000 lake sturgeon fingerlings have been stocked in the upper Mississippi and lower Missouri rivers since 1986. Survival of stocked fish is considered excellent as tagged lake sturgeon have been recaptured in the Mississippi, Missouri, Gasconade and Osage rivers and commercial fishermen have reported incidental catches reaching nuisance proportions (Hesse and Carreiro 1997).  Artificial culture and restocking of lake sturgeon is also under development in Minnesota using wild broodstock. Wisconsin DNR propagates some lake sturgeon for restocking purposes with cultured fish only being placed into the same basins from which broodstock were taken. The Tennessee Valley Authority has stocked thousands of young lake sturgeon within the Ohio River Basin.   <br/> <br/>A Lake Sturgeon Management Plan has been implemented in Alberta since 1997. This involves a zero catch limit on the North Saskatchewan River; and on the South Saskatchewan, a closed season during the 1 April to 15 June spawning period with a one fish limit (greater than 130 cm) outside that restricted season. There is no aboriginal fishery in Alberta. In Saskatchewan, a self-imposed moratorium on commercial catch of lake sturgeon has been in place since 1996 and sport angling has not been allowed since 1999. A multi-agency study of habitat, fish migration and abundance is currently underway (CMAC 2000). Manitoba reduced its possession limit of lake sturgeon to zero in 1995. The remaining few commercial fisheries closed down during the 1990s but catch and release angling is still allowed in addition to aboriginal subsistence fishing in most rivers. Lake sturgeon population management has been initiated in several Manitoba rivers with involvement of First Nations communities. <br/> <br/>In Ontario, a Lake Sturgeon Assessment Program has been implemented for Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair, including population abundance estimation and tagging to identify movements and verify ages. As enough information is developed a management plan for the species will be drafted.

This species was historically recorded in southwestern Korea and in western Kyushu, Japan and in the Yellow, Yangtze, Pear, Mingjiang, and Qingtang rivers in China, but has been extirpated from all of these areas except for the mid-lower section of the Yangtze River, below the Gezhouba dam. This species was historically overfished. In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals, but between 2005-2007 the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was estimated to be 203-257 individuals. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period. The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 blocked the migration routes of this species, making it impossible for it to reach spawning sites in the upper reaches of the river. Currently, there is just one remaining spawning ground (a 4 km stretch of river), which is situated below the Gezhouba dam. Furthermore, in 2003, the Three Gorges dam was constructed 40 km upstream of the Gezhouba dam. This has changed the hydrological regime (lowering the water level of the river in autumn and winter) and affected the water temperature. Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles (including larvae) were released into Yangtze River to increase population numbers, but the contribution to wild stocks is considered to be less than 10%. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.","This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Young of this species live in estuarine and nearshore habitats. When the species becomes sexually mature, it migrates up-river. Nearly mature adults (early stage III) arrive at the mouth of the Yangtze River in June or July. The adults do not feed while in the river. <br/><br/>Adults reach the middle sections of the river in September or October, where they overwinter. Ripe individuals were formerly found as far inland as the Jingsha River during the following October and November, where they spawned. Prior to construction of the Gezhouba Dam, the migration distance was as long as 2,500 to 3,300 km. Spawning sites often occur in turbulent sections of the river with rocky substrate and steep cliffs on both banks.<br/><br/>The roe is very large and it sinks and sticks to gravel until hatching.

This species attains a length of more than 3 metres.","This species has been historically overfished. In the 1970s, fishing was unlimited, but seasonal (occurring mostly between October and November). Gear types include gill nets (upper reach) and row hooks (middle reach).&#160; Due to its life history characteristics, once depleted, stocks of this species take a long time to recover. Fry are also captured by traditional Chinese fishing methods (drift nets in the river and set nets at the river mouth).<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation, alteration, destruction and changes to hydrological conditions also significantly impacts this species.

Synthetic chemicals in water could contribute to the population decline of this species by significantly decreasing both the quality and quantity of eggs and spawning frequency of fish (Hu 2009).","In the 1960s, this stock supported a major commercial fishery, but catches in the late 1970s had declined to about 500 fish per year (The Changjiang Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).<br/><br/>In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals. In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba dam isolated the upper reaches of the Yangtze river. In 1983 and 1984, the mean spawning stock size was estimated at 2,176 individuals (946 and 4,169 as 95% confidence intervals). Available data from acoustic surveys show that between 2005 and 2007, the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was 203-257. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period.<br/><br/>During 1996-2001, studies using tag-recapture methods, population structure analysis and sonar counting indicated that the spawning stock in the Yichang spawning area (mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze river) had decreased since the completion of the Gezhouba Dam. Annual estimates of spawning adults within the 40 km (including the 4km long spawning area) ranged from 199 to 473 (Chang 1999, Wei 2003).<br/><br/>Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles were released into Yangtze River to increase wild stocks.

13482515,40795,Nactus coindemirensis,Vulnerable,D2,2021,2020-05-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Vulnerable on the basis that this species is known to survive on four small islets following severe historical declines and local extinctions, most recently the loss of the Flat Island subpopulation in 2011. The population is presently stable following the removal of invasive mammalian predators from the largest subpopulation on Gunner's Quoin and the species is subject to ongoing monitoring. The population is exposed to predation by exotic ants and reintroduced native predators; it is not thought to be at immediate risk of extinction so long as ongoing conservation management continues. This situation will rapidly change should Gunner's Quoin be invaded by invasive predators/competitors, such as House Geckos, rats, shrews or wolf snakes, which have so far been prevented by conservation actions, but remains a plausible future threat, potentially facilitated by illegal visits to the islands where the species survives. The restricted range of the Lesser Night Gecko on the four small islets makes the species potentially highly susceptible to stochastic events including fire and storms.","The Lesser Night Gecko is nocturnal and insectivorous (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2009), although animals also consume nectar. The species is mostly found in coastal habitats on cliffs and in areas of large rock piles and bedrock with multiple deep crevices and cavities. Geckos also occupy dense mats of the native grass, <em>Zoysia tenuifolia</em> and areas of deep leaf litter and root systems of native and non-native vegetation. They will climb native and non-native trees and palms, taking refuge under loose bark and within palm crowns. They are highly cryptic and their base colour varies to match the colour of their habitat (Cole 2009). The average total body length and weight of adult geckos is 6 cm and 0.77 g, respectively, and their tail makes up half of the body length (Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al. </em>2009). Female geckos are generally larger and bulkier than males. Larger reptilian predators, such as the endemic Keel-scaled Boa <em>Casarea dussumieri </em>and Telfair’s Skink<em> Leiolopisma telfairii</em>, which have been reintroduced to Gunner’s Quoin, predate the gecko and they are occasionally taken by the native land crab <em>Geograpsus grayi</em> (N. Cole pers. obs.). The geckos are highly vocal, producing a loud repeated metallic ‘tchick’ sound, from which they can be easily identified from all other non-<em>Nactus</em> gecko species in Mauritius (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2009). The geckos call mostly at dusk and dawn, which has been used in combination with visual searches to survey the Mascarenes and outer islands for night gecko populations (Cole 2005, N. Cole unpublished data). The geckos can reproduce throughout the year, but gravid geckos are mostly encountered between June and February, with most hatchlings found from January to April (N. Cole unpublished data). Females lay one egg at a time and as often as every 25 days (Goble and Goetz 2011). At a temperature of 24/27 ºC (Night/Day) eggs hatched between 102–106 days and at 25/29ºC (Night/Day) eggs hatched between 82–95 days (Goble and Goetz 2011). Geckos reach maturity at eight months (Goble and Goetz 2011). Longevity is thought to be approximately four years (Goble and Goetz 2011), but individuals on Ile Marianne, in the absence of predators, have been repeatedly detected for up to seven years (MRRP unpublished data).","Historically, the Lesser Night Gecko has undergone a catastrophic decline, following the arrival of humans and the resulting loss of habitat and introduction of numerous non-native species from the 1500s (Cheke and Hume 2008). The introduced House Gecko <em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em> has been shown to predate and exclude Lesser Night Geckos from shared refuges, potentially exposing them to higher levels of predation and severe weather (Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2005). The House Gecko also has the potential to outcompete Lesser Night Geckos for shared food resources (Cole 2005). The Lesser Night Gecko does not persist in the presence of the House Gecko (Arnold and Jones 1994), but previously survived on Flat Island, where House Geckos were present but excluded from the powdery rock which the night geckos occupied (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2005). The invasive Big-headed Ant <em>Pheidole megacephala</em>&#160;predates and injures Lesser Night Geckos, although the extent of their impact is currently unknown. There are risks of further ant species invasions, such as Tropical Fire Ants <em>Solenopsis geminata</em>, which are known to predate the Lesser Night Geckos (Cole 2005). The invasion of Flat Island by the Musk Shrew in 2010 and the rapid extinction of the islet’s Lesser Night Gecko population, demonstrates the threat posed by this invasive predatory mammal. Not all invasive predatory mammals pose the same threat, as the Lesser Night Geckos survived on Gunner’s Quoin in the presence of Norway Rats for approximately 150 years, prior to rat eradication in 1995 (Cheke and Hume 2008). Both the Lesser Night Gecko and Durrell’s Night Gecko <em>Nactus durrellorum</em>, which had been experimentally released on Ilot Chat (0.029 ha) in 2006 to test the co-existence of the two species, did not survive the invasion of a single Ship Rat <em>Rattus rattus</em> in 2007 (Cole <em>et al</em>., 2009). Other potential invasive alien species in Mauritius that are a threat to the Lesser Night Gecko and known to cause rapid declines and the extirpation of small endemic terrestrial reptiles include the Indian Wolf Snake <em>Lycodon aulicus </em>and Tailless Tenrec <em>Tenrec ecaudatus </em>(Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al. </em>2009, Goder <em>et al</em>. 2015, MRRP unpublished data). The rate of offshore island invasion events is approximately three non-native fauna incursions per year, several of which have posed a significant threat to terrestrial biodiversity (Cole and Payne 2015). In most cases, staff of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and National Parks and Conservation Service through the Mauritius Reptile Recovery Programme have prevented non-native species incursions from establishing, although the risk of species arriving, for which there are no current methods for removal (such as house geckos or musk shrews) is high. All of the islets where the Lesser Night Gecko survives are closed to public access, but trespassers frequently access Gunner’s Quoin, Ile Marianne and Ilot Vacoas. Illegal access to the islets poses a risk of species introduction, but also from trampling, where crevices in which the geckos take refuge and deposit their eggs are crushed under foot. On Ilot Vacoas, the small area of rock occupied by the geckos is often covered in discarded charcoal or hot cooking oil from trespassers barbequing on the islet. Given the restricted range of the species, invasive predators and competitors, extreme weather, intense cyclones and fire all represent a significant threat to the survival of the species.","The global population of Lesser Night Gecko is estimated at approximately 18,000 individuals and currently considered stable. The largest subpopulation is found on Gunner’s Quoin, where in 2018, 37 line transects walked at night using distance sampling methodology estimated the population size at 16,753 (95% CI, range 11,861–23,663) adults (MRRP, unpublished data). Annual surveys of the subpopulation on Gunner’s Quoin since 2006 shows some fluctuation between 12,000 and 18,000 individuals, but overall the population is stable. Pigeon House Rock was last surveyed in 2004 (Cole 2005), where the population size has been extrapolated from encounter rate survey data to be approximately 200 individuals. The Pigeon House Rock subpopulation is considered to be stable, due to the remoteness and isolation of the islet from human disturbance. The gecko population size on Ilot Vacoas was estimated, through capture mark recapture method, at 237 (95% CI, range 136–413) adults in 2018 (MRRP, unpublished data). Annual surveys of the population on Ilot Vacoas since 2006, shows some fluctuation between 200 and 400 individuals, but overall the population is stable. The translocated subpopulation on Ile Marianne was estimated, through the capture mark recapture method, at 528 (95% CI, range 373–747) adults in 2019 (MRRP, unpublished data), following the release of 75 captive bred and wild caught individuals, originating from Ilot Vacoas in 2011 (MRRP 2011).",Stable,"This species is endemic to Mauritius and once thought to have been found throughout much of Mauritius and its surrounding islets. The introduction of non-native predators and competitors from the 16th century (Cheke and Hume 2008) has led to a catastrophic reduction in the gecko’s geographic range (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al</em>. 2005, MRRP (Mauritius Reptile Recovery Programme)&#160; 2011a). The species was discovered in 1982 on Gunner’s Quoin (0.70 km<sup>2</sup>; Bullock <em>et al. </em>1985), but had a severely restricted range here due to the presence of introduced Norway Rats <em>Rattus norvegicus.</em> By 1993, the species was considered extinct (Arnold and Jones 1994) and was erroneously (as no captive population existed) listed in a 1996 Red List assessment as ‘Extinct in the Wild’. In 1996, one year post rat eradication, the gecko population was rediscovered within restricted coastal rocky areas on Gunner’s Quoin (Dulloo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and by 2003, geckos were abundant around all coastal areas of the island (Cole 2005). Additional small subpopulations were discovered on Ilot Vacoas in 1993 (0.01 km<sup>2</sup>; Arnold and Jones 1994), Pigeon House Rock in 1998 (0.01 km<sup>2</sup>; Probst and Tézier 1998), and a small isolated rocky area on Flat Island in 2003 (2.53 km<sup>2</sup>; Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2005). The Flat Island subpopulation was estimated at 61 (95% confidence interval,&#160; range 44–85) adult geckos in 2010, but following the invasion of the island by Musk Shrews <em>Suncus murinus</em> in the same year, the Flat Island subpopulation became extinct in 2011 (Cole 2011). In 2011, 75 wild caught and captive-bred geckos from Ilot Vacoas were translocated to Ile Marianne (0.02 km<sup>2</sup>; MRRP 2011), where the subpopulation has now become established (MRRP unpublished data).The Lesser Night Gecko has restricted ranges on each of the four islets, occupying 0.33 km<sup>2</sup> on Gunner’s Quoin, 0.001 km<sup>2</sup> on Ile Marianne, 0.001 km<sup>2</sup> on Ilot Vacoas and 0.005 km<sup>2</sup> on Pigeon House Rock. However, using the Geospatial Conservation Assessment Tool (GeoCat) the area of occupancy is 20 km<sup>2 </sup>and the extent of occurrence is 251.2 km<sup>2</sup>. The elevation range of the species is from 0 to 125 m above sea level.","Whilst there may be demand for the species within the pet trade, there are currently no individuals known to exist in captivity, legally or otherwise. The capture of endemic reptile in Mauritius is not permitted without the authorization of the National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security, Government of Mauritius.",Terrestrial,"The conservation of the Lesser Night Gecko is part of an ongoing conservation programme by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and National Parks and Conservation Service to restore the reptile communities on the offshore islets of Mauritius (Cole <em>et al.</em> 2009). All four islets that support Lesser Night Gecko populations are closed to public access, with Gunner’s Quoin and Ile Marianne designated as Closed Islet Nature Reserves and Ilot Vacoas and Pigeon House Rock designated as Closed Islet National Parks. The removal of rats from Gunner’s Quoin and ensuring, where possible, that the islets remain free from invasive competitors and predators has permitted the survival of the species. Whilst the loss of the Flat Island subpopulation to the invasion of the Musk Shrew in 2011 caused a decline in the extent of occurrence, the establishment of the population on Ile Marianne from the conservation introduction in 2011 led to an overall increase in the species abundance and range. Plans to translocate lesser night geckos to the Closed Nature Reserve Round Island (2.19 km<sup>2</sup>) from 2020 are underway. Round Island is a key restoration site where public access is prohibited and protected by the permanent presence of staff and wardens, jointly managed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, and National Parks and Conservation Service (Jones 2008). Ongoing activities to restore the plant community on Round Island, particularly the reintroduction of native hardwoods (Jones 2008), is likely to improve habitat and food resources for the night gecko. The Mauritian Wildlife Foundation has been running educational workshops and site visits with government departments, tour operators, private boat owners and fishermen that use the southeast and northern islets to work towards reducing associated threats, which will benefit the lesser night gecko populations.

Invasion remains a continuing threat to populations on the remaining, much smaller islands where this lizard still occurs. This species is dependent on active conservation management to prevent the establishment of alien invasive species within its remaining range, and the species is therefore considered to be undergoing a continuing decline although the population presently appears to be stable.","<p>This is a diurnal skink that occupies most habitat types on the islands of Mauritius. It is predominantly terrestrial, although is frequently seen climbing vertical rocky features, trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants to bask or in search of food (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009). Native grasslands dominated by <em>Stenotaphrum dimidiatum</em> support the highest densities of this species, seconded by forested and palm rich habitats, with a mixture of deep leaf litter and rotting logs (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mauritius Reptile Recovery Programme MRRP 2011). The diet consists mainly of small invertebrates as well as fruits and small vertebrates (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2009). The species will scavenge carrion and dropped food from island visitors, and are occasionally cannibalistic (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2009). Animals lay two eggs per clutch, which are buried into the soil or under logs (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2009). Repeated surveys of individuals identified from their dorsal patterns on the southeast islands have demonstrated that they can reach sexual maturity within a period of ten months and live for approximately three to four years (MRRP unpublished data). Annual apparent survival has been estimated at 54% (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009); generation time, based on the best available estimate of mean age at reproduction, has been estimated at three years (N. Cole, unpubl. data). It is not known how many clutches individuals produce within a season, but from captive breeding of <em>Gongylomorphus </em>at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust it is thought to be at least three clutches per season (M. Goetz pers comm. 2012). The skinks are reproductively active between July and February (MRRP unpublished data). Juveniles hatch between August and April, although low levels of reproductive activity do occur outside of these dates (MRRP unpublished data). Of all the islands where the species currently exists, Round Island has the greatest elevation at 280 m above sea level, and skinks occur at all altitudes.&#160;</p>","<p>Historically, the Bojer’s Skink population declined considerably since the 19th Century due to the introduction of lizard predators, including the Common Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>) and Musk Shrew (<em>Suncus murinus</em>) (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Tonge 1990, Jones 1993, Freeman 2003, MRRP 2011, Cole <em>et al</em>. 2014), and it is now extinct on the main island of Mauritius. Other introduced predators such as rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>), mongooses and feral cats, are also thought to have contributed to these historical declines (Jones 1993).<br/><br/>The recent introduction of the shrew to Flat Island has led to the loss of approximately 80% of the global population since 2010. Gabriel Island, Ile aux Fouquets, Ilot Vacoas and Ile de la Passe are also threatened with the introduction of the shrew, Common Wolf Snake and other invasive predators. The other islands are also threatened with invasion by these species, but to a lesser degree owing to their remoteness and/or inaccessibility. Round Island is further protected by the permanent presence of wardens and established biosecurity protocols. The rate of offshore island invasion events is approximately three non-native fauna species per year (23 invasion events in the past eight years), several of which have posed a significant threat to terrestrial biodiversity. However, in most cases the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and National Parks and Conservation Service have prevented establishment following these incursions (MRRP unpublished data).<br/><br/>Other threats to the skink on the smaller islands include: trampling of habitat; littering that entraps and kills skinks; and fire as a result of human activities on the accessible islands. Severe climatic conditions are also thought to cause fluctuations in skink abundance on some of the islands (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2014). The smaller islands are heavily trespassed despite being closed to public access leading to threats from disturbances and accidental introductions of predators.</p>","<p>The Bojer’s Skink population is currently stable following a massive sudden decline beginning in 2010. The total current population has been estimated as 128,996 individuals. The population is considered to be divided into three subpopulations: Serpent Island (700 individuals), northern islands (127,000 individuals) and the southeastern islands (1,296 individuals); although the latter two consist of multiple island populations with little dispersal ability, none of the population sizes are below 100 individuals and are therefore considered viable. As a result the population is not considered to be severely fragmented. The current population estimate was obtained from genetic estimates of effective population size, transects, capture-mark-recapture, and absolute density studies through the Mauritius Reptile Recovery Programme run by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and National Parks and Conservation Service.</p>",Stable,"<p>Bojer’s Skink is a Mauritian endemic that was once widespread throughout much of the Mauritian mainland and surrounding islands (Vinson and Vinson 1969). However, the invasion of the Common Wolf Snake<em> Lycodon capucinus </em>and Musk Shrew <em>Suncus murinus</em> have caused severe reductions in the skink’s distribution, and the species now only exists on offshore islands where these species are absent (Tonge 1990, Jones 1993, Freeman 2003). The current distribution of the species consists of: Serpent Island (0.32 km<sup>2</sup>), Round Island (2.19 km<sup>2</sup>), Gunner’s Quoin (0.76 km<sup>2</sup> limited to 0.67 km<sup>2</sup>), Gabriel Island (0.42 km<sup>2</sup>), Pigeon House Rock (0.006 km<sup>2</sup>, within which the skink is limited to 0.004 km<sup>2</sup>) and Ilot Vacoas (0.01 km<sup>2</sup>, within which the skink is limited to 0.006 km<sup>2</sup>). Two additional subpopulations now exist on Ile de la Passe (0.02 km<sup>2</sup>, within which the skink is limited to 0.01 km<sup>2</sup>) and Ile aux Fouquets (0.03 km<sup>2</sup>, within which the skink is limited to 0.01 km<sup>2</sup>) as a result of reintroductions (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2013). The species was also present on Flat Island - representing an estimated 41% of its area of occupancy and 80% of its global population - until the invasion of shrews in 2010. It has not been detected since 2011 despite extensive annual surveys, and is thought to have been lost altogether within two years of the invasion (MRRP 2011, Cole 2011, 2012, Stanbury 2012, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>",There is no use of or trade in this species.,Terrestrial,"<p>Bojer’s Skinks are part of a current conservation programme by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, and National Parks and Conservation Service to restore the reptile communities on the offshore islands of Mauritius.<br/><br/>The extant populations form two main haplogroups that separate the Ilot Vacoas population from those in the northern populations (Austin <em>et al.</em> 2009). The Serpent Island population is genetically similar to the other northern populations but morphologically distinct (Freeman 2003; Austin <em>et al. </em>2009). Currently, the Ilot Vacoas and Serpent Island populations are treated as separate conservation management units from the other northern populations.<br/><br/>The Serpent Island population is considered to be stable, as it is remote and difficult to access, such that there is little threat from direct anthropogenic disturbances. The Ilot Vacoas population has been the focus of recent conservation action. Shrews were eradicated from Ile de la Passe (Varnham <em>et al</em>. 2002) and the skink was reintroduced to the neighbouring Ile aux Fouquets and Ile de la Passe between 2007 and 2013 where they are now well established (Cole <em>et al</em> 2009, Cole <em>et al</em>. 2013, Michaelides <em>et al</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The eradication of introduced mammalian herbivores and predators from some of the northern islands were significant conservation actions that have led to increases in skink abundance since the 1980s, at least for Gunner’s Quoin and Round Island (Bullock 1986, North et al 1994).

17945814,4229,Cercopithecus sclateri,Endangered,A2cd,2019,2019-01-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered because Sclater’s Monkey is estimated to have undergone a population decline exceeding 50% over the past three generations (about 27 years, assuming a generation length of nine years),&#160;resulting from a decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality, and high levels of exploitation. This decline is projected to continue into the future, and its rate will probably intensify due to continuing widespread habitat loss and degradation and hunting.&#160;Additionally, the species does not occur in any officially gazetted wildlife conservation area. In large part, Sclater’s Monkey persists due to its small size, cryptic nature, adaptability and general non-preferred status among hunters relative to other monkeys. Close population monitoring should take place. However, such monitoring may be hampered by insecurity in the Niger Delta and in other parts of the species’ range and by the lack of an organised national programme in Nigeria focusing on Sclater’s Monkey.","<p>The original habitat of Sclater’s Monkey is moist tropical lowland forest, but due to severe habitat degradation, this species now persists in remnant secondary, gallery/riparian and freshwater swamp forests. The species is also found in marginal forest and farm-bush in communities where monkeys are regarded as sacred (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992, Tooze 1995, Baker 2005). Sclater’s Monkey is likely omnivorous, with a diet similar to other members of the <em>C. cephus</em> group: mostly fruits, insects and young foliage (Oates and Baker 2013).</p>","The rapidly growing human population of Nigeria is expected to be the third largest globally by 2050. This growth has been accompanied by widespread environmental degradation and will continue to negatively affect natural habitats. Across Nigeria, land area devoted to agriculture and plantations (crop and grazing lands, floodplain agriculture, irrigation and livestock projects, and tree and forest plantations) increased by nearly 84,000&#160;km²&#160;between 1976 and 1995. More than half of the country’s undisturbed lowland moist forest was lost during that same time frame (from 25,951 to 12,114                    km²) (Geomatics International <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160;From 1990–2015, net forest loss across Nigeria continued at a rate of 3.5% annually, resulting in a loss of ~4,100&#160;km²&#160;each year – more than any other African nation. During this period, Nigeria lost 59.4% of its forested area and 98.7% of its primary forest (FAO 2015). During the latter part of this period, from 2000–2015, the rate of forest loss across Nigeria accelerated (5%) (FAO 2015), and the percent of forest cover declined from 14.4% to 7.7% (World Bank 2017).&#160;Conversion of forested areas to farmland is a major contributor to this decline; for the decade ending in 2008, Nigeria converted more land to annual crops than did any other tropical nation (Phalan <em>et al.</em> 2013). The southeastern region of Nigeria, where Sclater’s Monkey occurs, has among the highest human population densities in the country and one of the highest in Africa. As a result, most natural forest across this species’ range has been converted to cultivated land; unregulated logging and activities associated with oil exploration and production have added to the destruction (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992, Baker and Olubode 2008). Of particular concern for Sclater’s Monkey is severe habitat fragmentation, resulting in a lack of connectivity among existing populations and associated loss of heterozygosity in population isolates.&#160;Additionally, the species does not occur in any official wildlife conservation area or have any effective protection from exploitation outside of the very few sites where it is protected by local communities owing to social taboos.","<p>Given widespread habitat loss across this species’ range, many of the remaining populations of Sclater’s Monkey are isolated, and most occur in&#160;highly&#160;degraded, unprotected forests. This degradation, combined with hunting pressure and lack of official protection, has led to decline of the population. The species’ persistence in southeastern Nigeria can be attributed to the species’ small size, shy nature and adaptability, and preferential hunting of larger-bodied primate taxa (Baker and Olubode 2008). Until the 1990s, Sclater’s Monkey was thought to be very rare, but extensive surveys since then have revealed its presence at a number of formerly unknown sites. In one regional survey, Baker and Olubode (2008) did not encounter any localities of recent extirpation (or sites where local reports indicated that populations of this species had been extirpated even though suitable habitat remains). Nevertheless, encounter rates were low: 0.18 detections per km surveyed.<br/><br/>In the very few sites where it is not hunted, or where hunting is less commonly practised (such as the Niger Delta where some communities rely on fish as their main protein source), this species may fare relatively well compared to larger primates. In the Edumanom Forest Reserve, a comparatively large forest block in the Niger Delta, one study found Sclater’s Monkey to be the most abundant diurnal primate encountered, occurring in an estimated 3.1 groups per&#160;km² (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011). In three village sites where Sclater’s Monkey is protected by social taboos&#160;(i.e. monkeys are not killed), populations appear to increase: 1) Lagwa, Imo State (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a); 2) Akpugoeze community complex, Enugu State (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2018); and 3) Ikot Uso Akpan, Akwa Ibom State (Eniang and Egwali 2011). However, the survival of these populations requires them to adapt to living in heavily deforested, urbanizing environments. Although apparently increasing, these populations are also relatively small: 178 individuals in Ikot Uso Akpan (Eniang and Egwali 2011), 206 individuals in Lagwa (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a), and 339 individuals in the Akpugoeze community complex (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to southern Nigeria. It ranges from the eastern Niger Delta in Bayelsa State east to the Cross River, and north to Enugu and Ebonyi States; the most northerly known populations occur in southern Anambra-Enugu States and central Ebonyi State (Baker and Olubode 2008). Sclater’s Monkey was feared extinct until it was sighted southwest of Oguta, Imo State, in 1988 (Oates and Anadu 1989). Additional populations were subsequently discovered in the early to mid-1990s (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992; Tooze 1995, 1996). In a 2004 regional survey, the species was located in several sites where it had not been previously recorded (Baker 2005, Baker and Olubode 2008). Across its range, this species has generally been recorded in fragmented, degraded forests (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1992, Tooze 1995, Baker and Olubode 2008).","Being the smallest diurnal primate across its range (along with <em>Cercopithecus erythrogaster</em>), Sclater’s Monkey has the lowest economic value as bushmeat relative to other diurnal primates. While it is sought after by hunters, some hunters consider the species more difficult to kill due to its size and cryptic nature, and some do not bother hunting Sclater’s Monkey given the lower profit it brings (Baker and Olubode 2008).",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is currently listed as Class B under the African Convention and under Appendix II of CITES.<br/><br/>There are no formally protected areas in the range of Sclater’s Monkey. Important conservation measures suggested by Baker (2005) include: 1) elevating the species to Schedule I of the Nigerian Endangered Species Act (this change may not be considered unless the species is elevated to CITES Appendix I); 2) raising awareness about the species and its uniquely Nigerian status through publicity and education; and 3) enhancing protection of key forests, including the Edumanom Forest Reserve in Bayelsa State, Upper Orashi Forest Reserve in Rivers State and the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve in Akwa Ibom State.<br/><br/>Communities where Sclater’s Monkey receives cultural protection (through social taboos) are also very important, although forest cover in these sites has been greatly reduced over time.&#160;These include Ikot Uso Akpan and other communities in the Itam region (Akwa Ibom State), Lagwa (Imo State) and the Akpugoeze community complex (Enugu State). In Lagwa and Akpugoeze, previous and existing conservation measures include school-based awareness programmes, stakeholder workshops,&#160;documentation and publishing of folklore and oral histories related to the cultural value of monkeys, and population and forest monitoring (Baker 2013; Baker <em>et al.</em> 2009; 2014a,b; 2018). Forest restoration and conservation awareness efforts have also been conducted in Ikot Uso Akpan (Jacob <em>et al.</em> 2013). Development of small-scale ecotourism in these communities should be explored, given how readily monkeys can be observed at these sites.<br/><br/>Other potential areas for enhanced protection are the Niger floodplain and Osomari Forest Reserve (Oates <em style=""font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.</em> 1992), as well as the Blue River (Azumini, Abia State) and Enyong Creek/Ikpa River (Akwa Ibom State) (Tooze 1995).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

A single post-spawning individual was collected in a deep sluggish run over silty sand (Bart and Piller 1997). Five breeding males were collected from the Leaf River (Pascagoula system, Mississippi) in shallow water (15 cm) over firm gravel and cobble in mid-channel (Bart and Piller 1997). Suttkus <em>et al</em>. (1994) mentioned that specimens were collected in rivers in slow to swift current over gravel substrate at depths of 0.5 m or more.","<strong>Summary (USFWS 2011)</strong><br/>""The Pearl Darter is vulnerable to non-point source pollution caused by urbanization and other land use activities; gravel mining and resultant changes in river geomorphology, especially head cutting; and the possibility of water quantity decline from the proposed Department of Energy Strategic Petroleum Reserve project and a proposed dam on the Bouie River. Additional threats are posed by the apparent lack of adequate state and federal water quality regulations due to the continuing degradation of water quality within the species' habitat. The Pearl Darter's localized distribution and apparent low population numbers may indicate a species with lower genetic diversity and would also make this species more vulnerable to catastrophic events."" Threat magnitude is regarded as moderate to low (USFWS 2011).<br/><br/><strong>Further details</strong><br/>Removal of riparian vegetation and extensive cultivation adjacent to rivers have caused excessive rapid runoff, bank erosion, channel scouring, and silt deposition in the Pearl River drainage, evidently resulting in large population declines and possible extirpation (Suttkus <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Because of its restriction to the Pascagoula drainage and localization to specific habitats, the Pearl Darter is vulnerable to nonpoint source pollution, changes in river and stream geomorphology, and other human-induced threats to its environment, such as dam construction. Nonpoint source pollution from land surface runoff can originate from virtually all land use activities, and may include sediments, fertilizers, pesticides, animal wastes, septic tank and grey water leakage, oils, and greases. Construction activities that involve significant earthworks typically increase sediment loads into nearby streams. Siltation sources include timber clear cutting, clearing of riparian vegetation, and mining and agricultural practices that allow exposed earth to enter streams. Practices that affect sediment and water discharges into a stream system change the erosion or sedimentation pattern, which can lead to the destruction of riparian vegetation, bank collapse, and increased water turbidity and temperature. Excessive sediments are believed to impact the habitat of darters and associated fish species by making it unsuitable for feeding and reproduction. Sediment has been shown to abrade and or suffocate periphyton, disrupt aquatic insect natural processes, and, ultimately, negatively impact fish growth, survival, and reproduction (Waters 1995).<br/><br/>In the Pascagoula drainage, water quality problems exist on the Leaf River from municipal runoff at Hattiesburg and dioxin contamination at New Augusta and on the Chickasawhay River from brine water releases from oil fields (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). Permitted effluents to the Pascagoula River Basin include ammonia, chloride, sodium sulphate, toluene, cyclohexane, and acetone (EPA 1989). Bart and Piller (1997) noted extensive algal growth during warmer months in the Leaf and Bouie rivers, suggesting nutrient and organic enrichment. Municipal and industrial discharges into the watershed, particularly during low water, concentrate pollutants. Releases from the Leaf River Paper Mill at New Augusta affect temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH in the lower reaches of the Leaf River. Existing housing and urbanization along the banks of the Leaf River between I-59 and Eastabuchie may contribute nutrient loading through sewage and septic water effluent. <br/><br/>The flora and fauna of many coastal plain streams have been adversely affected by accelerated geomorphic processes, specifically headcutting caused by in-stream sand and gravel mining (Patrick <em>et al</em>. 1993). The bed of the Bouie River is considered a significant natural resource by American Sand and Gravel (ASGC) (1995). Historically, ASGC has mined sand and gravel using a hydraulic suction dredge, which is operated within the banks of the Bouie River. Sand and gravel mining also has occurred within and adjacent to the Leaf River. Large sections of the river and its floodplain have been removed over the past 50 years resulting in the creation of very large open water areas that function as deep lake systems (ASGC 1995). Currently, only two permitted mines are operating within the Pascagoula drainage (Stan Phielling, Mississippi Geological Survey, Mining Office, pers. comm. 1998). However, due to the permit exemption category for mining of less than 4 acres and less than 1/4 mile from other mine sites, there are numerous non-permitted operators mining gravel throughout the Pascagoula and Pearl river drainages (Stan Phielling, Mississippi Geological Survey, Mining Office, pers. comm. 1998). Hartfield (1993) and Patrick and Hartfield (1996) investigated the negative impacts of stream erosion due to headcutting on aquatic life in several Mississippi river drainages and believed that the drainages were also experiencing geomorphic instability caused by in-stream sand and gravel mining. Mining in active river channels typically results in incision upstream of the mine (by nickpoint migration) and sediment deposition downstream. The upstream migration of nickpoints or headcutting may cause undermining of structures, lowering of alluvial water tables, channel de-stabilization and widening, and loss of aquatic and riparian habitat. Geomorphic change, particularly headcutting, may cause the extirpation of riparian and lotic (flowing water) species (Patrick <em>et al</em>. 1993). Lyttle (1993) and Brown and Lyttle (1992) found that in-stream gravel mining reduces overall fish species diversity in Ozark streams and favours a large number of a few small fish species. Patrick <em>et al</em>.(1993) documented geomorphic changes that were adversely affecting the Bayou Darter, an endangered species endemic to the Bayou Pierre basin. Bart and Piller (1997) attributed the decline of the Pearl Darter in the Leaf and Bouie Rivers and Black Creek of the Pascagoula drainage to threats from siltation caused by unstable banks and loose and unconsolidated stream beds. Bart (pers. comm. 1999) believes that bank erosion and bar migration on the Leaf River at Eastabuchie is affecting the riffles where the only known spawning of the Pearl Darter is occurring. <br/><br/>The confluence of the Bouie and Leaf rivers, within the Pascagoula drainage, possibly provides significant habitat for the Pearl Darter. Fish collections from this area indicate that it may be a site critical for maintaining the current population of Pearl Darters. The Bouie River at the confluence with the Leaf River is being considered by the city of Hattiesburg to be dammed and used as a major water supply (The Clarion-Ledger, October 28, 1998, Jackson, Mississippi). Such a project would substantially alter and fragment significant occupied habitat of the Pearl Darter in the Bouie River. Locality records (1997) of the Pearl Darter within the gravel mine area of the Bouie River in Hattiesburg place the species within the exact vicinity of the proposed dam (Ross pers. comm. 1998). Pearl Darters have not been collected in impounded waters and are intolerable of lentic (standing water) habitats.  <br/><br/>The current range of the Pearl Darter is restricted to localized sites within the Pascagoula River drainages. Genetic diversity has probably declined due to fragmentation and separation of populations. The long-term viability of a species is founded on conservation of numerous local populations throughout its geographic range (Harris 1984). These features are essential for the species to recover and adapt to environmental change (Noss <em>et al</em>. 1994, Harris 1984). Populations of Pearl Darters are becoming increasingly disjunct. This disjunct distribution makes these populations vulnerable to extirpation from catastrophic events, such as toxic spills, large in-stream gravel mining projects, or changes in flow regime. <br/><br/>In general, small species of fish such as the Pearl Darter, which are not utilized for either sport or bait purposes, are unknown to the general public. Therefore, take of these species by the general public has not been a problem. Scientific collecting and take by private and institutional collectors are not presently identified as threats. Scientific collecting is controlled by the State through permits. <br/><br/>Predation upon the Pearl Darter undoubtedly occurs. However, there is no evidence to suggest that disease or natural predators threaten this species. To the extent that disease or predation occur, it becomes a more important consideration as the total population decreases in number.","A map in Ross (2001) suggests that the species currently exists in four areas, some of which are represented by at least two known sites.<br/><br/>Even before its description in 1994, the Pearl Darter was considered rare and of conservation concern (Deacon <em>et al</em>. 1997) because it was uncommon, infrequently collected, and occurred in low numbers (Bart and Piller 1997). The Pearl Darter was collected from only 14% of 716 fish collections from site specific locations within the Pearl River drainage despite annual collection efforts by Suttkus from 1958 to 1973 (Bart and Suttkus 1996, Suttkus <em>et al</em>. 1994). No Pearl Darters have been collected in the Pearl River drainage since 1973, even though Suttkus has made 64 fish collections over the last 25 years from the Pearl River (Bart and Piller 1997). Collection data from Bart and Piller (1997), Bart and Suttkus (1996), Suttkus <em>et al</em>. (1994), and Ross (in press) suggest that the Pearl Darter is very rare in the Pascagoula River system. Bart and Piller (1997) examined Suttkus' work before 1974 and found that only 19 Pearl Darters were collected out of 19,300 total fish in 10 Tulane University Museum of Natural History collections. Additionally, from the ""Mississippi Freshwater Fishes Database,"" Dr. Stephen Ross (in Bart and Piller 1997) estimated the rarity of the Pearl Darter within the Pascagoula drainage from 379 collections (81,514 fish specimens) since 1973, and found only one Pearl Darter collected for every 4,795 specimens.<br/><br/>This fish disappeared from several areas in the Pearl River in the 1970s (Suttkus <em>et al</em>. 1994); now it is regarded as extirpated in that drainage (USFWS 2011). Collections since the early 1980s indicate that the range has decreased by approximately 55 percent (USFWS 2011).<br/><br/>Trend over the past 10 years or three generations is uncertain, but habitat quality and possibly distribution and abundance probably are slowly declining.",Unknown,"Historical distribution included localized sites in the Pearl and Pascagoula river drainages, Mississippi and Louisiana (Suttkus <em>et al</em>. 1994); the species is now apparently extirpated in the Pearl River drainage in both Mississippi and Louisiana (Ross 2001, H. Bart and B. Thompson pers. comm. cited by Douglas and Jordan 2002).<br/>Fish collections from the Pearl River drainage (Suttkus <em>et al</em>. 1994) suggest that the darter once inhabited the large tributaries and main channel habitats from St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, to Simpson County, Mississippi, including sections of the Pearl River, Strong River, and Bogue Chitto River.  Bruce Thompson made 27 samples at eight localities on the Bogue Chitto and Pearl rivers (historical locations and others) on 10 different dates from November 1998 to September 1999 and did not find <em>Percina aurora</em>. He did find everything else he would have expected at those sites in those habitats (Steve Shively, Zoologist, Louisiana Natural Heritage Program, pers. comm. 1999).<br/><br/>Museum collections suggest that the Pearl Darter inhabited the main channels of large Pascagoula drainage tributaries from Jackson to Lauderdale counties, Mississippi, including the Pascagoula River, Black Creek, Leaf River, Okatoma Creek, Chickasawhay River, Bouie River, and Chunky Creek.  Since 1983, Pearl Darters have only been found in scattered sites in the Pascagoula, Chickasawhay, Chunky, Leaf, and Bouie rivers, and Okatoma and Black creeks (compiled from Bart and Piller 1997 and Ross in press). Bart and Piller (1997) made 27 ancillary collections in 1996 and 1997 from the Pascagoula drainage and collected only 10 Pearl Darters at four sites (the Leaf River at Eastabuchie; lower Leaf River at Merrill; Bouie River downstream of I-59 crossing; and Okatoma Creek at Collins). Three specimens were collected in the Leaf River at Eastabuchie in the spring of 1998, whereas in December 1998 no Pearl Darters were found in the upper reaches of the Leaf River between Eastabuchie and north Hattiesburg (Bart and Ross pers. comm. 1998). No Pearl Darters were found in selected sites of the Chunky River in 1995 and 1997 (Bart pers. comm. 1999). Suttkus <em>et al</em>. (1994) speculated that portions of the Leaf River and possibly the lower Black Creek may continue to support reproducing populations even though no recent collecting attempts had been made.",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"More information on the Pearl Darter's ecology, life history, and sensitivity to contaminants, to determine the effectiveness of existing environmental laws and regulations, is needed.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

This species is of commercial and recreational importance throughout its range and has experienced population declines in the past. Since the 1980s restocking initiatives have taken place. Overexploitation and habitat degradation may pose threats to this species; however, the overall population of&#160;<em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii</em>&#160;appears to be stable. Therefore, it is listed as Least Concern.&#160;Additional taxonomic work needs to be conducted for the <em>A. schlegelii </em>complex.","<em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii</em>&#160;is found in bays, shallow rocky reefs, and in brackish waters (Nakabo 2002) to 50 m depth (Gonzalez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008) and&#160;feeds on molluscs and polychaetes. Individuals will attain 12 cm BL in the first year of life and up to 19 cm BL by the age of two (Masuda <em>et al.</em>&#160;1975). The&#160;maximum age for this species is over 15 years for aquarium specimens (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2009). <em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii </em>spawns in the spring and summer months (Nakabo 2002) and is a protandrous hermaphrodite (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). This species can attain 50 cm SL (Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984).&#160;The maximum age for this species is&#160;15 or more years for aquarium species (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2009).","<em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii&#160;</em>is a high value fish in Viet Nam (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2009).&#160;<em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii </em>is a very important commercial and recreational species throughout its range and&#160;has been overfished in the past.&#160;Overfishing is a threat to this species in Taiwan (K. Shao pers. comm. 2009) and also in Japan (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2009).&#160;This species exhibits life history traits that make it vulnerable to overexploitation which may be exacerbated by major past declines. Although, intensive restocking initiatives have been implemented for this species, possible threats still include overfishing.&#160;<em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii&#160;</em>may also be susceptible to habitat loss and degradation as a result of eutrophication, solid waste and other pollution, and coastal impacts from climate change (Islam and Tanaka 2004).<br/><br/>The large number of hatchery-reared black sea bream juveniles released in Hiroshima Bay appears to have increased the stock biomass. This has caused density-dependent decreases in size-at-age and a shift in the sex ratio. These findings highlight the potential negative effects of intensive releases of cultured juvenile fish (Blanco-Gonzalez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2009).","About 30 years ago, overfishing lead to a drastic reduction in landings of <em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii </em>in Hiroshima Bay and an intensive stock enhancement program was subsequently implemented in the 1980s (Gonzalez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;<em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii</em>, has been stocked into Hiroshima Bay in the western part of the Seto Inland Sea of Japan since the early 1980s. Stock enhancement program of <em>A. schlegelii</em> was initiated when annual landings dropped below 200 tonnes. The number of&#160;<em>A.&#160;</em><em>schlegelii&#160;</em>juveniles released in 1996 exceeded nine million, representing the third main species stocked in Japan, with almost 1.4 million of the juveniles released into Hiroshima bay (Gonzalez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Around six million fingerlings are artificially stocked annually in Japan (Fushimi 2001).&#160;More than one million juveniles were released each year between 1985 and 1996. Subsequently, total harvest increased to &gt;200 tonnes per year and Hiroshima Bay is now the primary fishing ground for this species in Japan, accounting for 10% of total domestic landings. More than half of the <em>A. schlegelii</em>&#160;population is caught in the Seto Inland Sea with Hiroshima Bay (Blanco-Gonzalez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;After the Hiroshima Bay stock enhancement in the early 1980s, data suggest that the combined effects of releases of cultured juveniles and reduced fishing effort resulted in reduced size-at-age in black sea bream due to density-dependent processes. Further support for the hypothesis that the carrying capacity for black sea bream was exceeded in 2000 comes from the sex ratio. It appears that by 2000, many of the released fish, and those no longer as vulnerable to capture due to lower fishing effort, had matured as females (Blanco-Gonzalez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<br/><br/>In Hiroshima Prefecture, western Japan, the catch of black sea bream accounted for 15% of the total black sea bream catch in Japan. Hiroshima Bay is known as the main fishing ground with 60% of the catch in the prefecture. The recent increment in the volume of landings of this fish seems to be linked to the intensive stocking practices in the area since 1982 (Jeong <em>et al.</em> 2007). However, overall landings decreasing in Japan (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2009).&#160;The increase in population of this species from catch is largely due to stocking in Taiwan (Liao pers. comm. 2009).&#160;In 1982 and 1983, prior to the intensive stocking, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) in Hiroshima Bay remained low but in 1999 and 2000, the CPUE increased 10-fold (Blanco-Gonzalez <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/>FAO capture production in Taiwan for the&#160;<em>A. schlegelii</em>&#160;show an increase from 1998 to 2007, from 604 tonnes with a peak in 2001 of 878 tonnes and 602 tonnes in 2007. Total production for <em>A. schlegelii</em>&#160;in Taiwan in 1995 was approximately 7,000 tonnes and this had declined by 2007 to 1,157 mt with an estimated value of 165,233 NT $ (Fisheries Agency 2007). This decline is thought to be because of overfishing (K. Shao pers. comm. 2009).<br/><br/>The increase in population from catch is largely due to stocking in Taiwan (W. Liao pers. comm. 2009).",Stable,"<em>Acanthpagrus schlegelii</em>&#160;ranges from the Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea, the Pacific coasts of Japan from the central Honshu down to Ryukyu Islands, the Eastern-Chinese Sea and the South-Chinese Sea (Lindberg and Krasyukova&#160;1969,&#160;Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984,&#160;Sadvoy and Cornish 2000,&#160;Nakabo 2002), the coast of the Republic of China, Taiwan and to central Viet Nam. This species occurs to 50 m depth (Gonzalez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).",<em>Acanthopagrus schlegelii&#160;</em>is a high value fish in Viet Nam (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2009).

They are the only sirenians restricted to freshwater systems.&#160;<em>T. inunguis</em>&#160;occurs in waters with temperatures above 23<sup>o</sup>C (Gallivan <em>et al.</em> 1983), living in the three types of water in Amazonian rivers (white, black and clear), being more abundant in white waters, where there is greater primary production (Best 1984, Rosas 1994).</p><p>Individuals engage in long seasonal movements, moving from flooded areas during the wet season to deep water bodies during the dry season (Arraut <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kendall <em>et al.</em> 2014). While the whitewater rivers (murky water) provide them with plentiful food, deep lakes function as refuges during the low-water season, where animals are less vulnerable to hunting.</p><p>Only one calf is produced at a time. Although no specific studies are available for the species in the wild, it is believed that the reproductive cycle is similar to the West Indian Manatee’s, with a long gestation and lactation period (up to 24 months), and a birthing interval of 2 to 3 years (Best 1983); age at sexual maturity is suggested to be between 6 and 10 years (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>  <p>Generation length is 25 years, based on what is known for <em>T. manatus.</em></p>","<p>The commercial large scale capture of Amazonian Manatee was the main reason for the reduction of the populations of the species. The main current threats for Manatees are hunting for meat consumption (Denkinger 2010, Brice <em>et al.</em> 2011, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sandoval 2015), entanglement in fishing nets and habitat alterations.</p>  <p><em>Illegal hunting</em>, for both subsistence and local use, is considered the main threat to Manatees in the Amazon. Manatee populations have supported a tremendous take in past centuries and, although not at commercial levels, hunting still takes place throughout the region (Barbosa <em>et al. </em>2010a, b; Franzini <em>et al. </em>2013; Silva <em>et al. </em>2014; M. Marmontel pers. obs). Most hunting is practiced with the use of traditional harpoons, but in Ecuador Manatees may be caught in traps set for <em>Arapaima</em> (Hidalgo 2010).</p>  <p>Hunters usually sell products to neighbors and nearby communities, but the meat is sometimes sold in local produce fairs or markets in the interior, or by order directly with the hunter. Public markets in Brazil (Manaus, Manacapuru, Beruri, Novo Airão, Tefé, Silves, Itapiranga, Itacoatiara, Santarém, Belém, Monte Alegre and Almeirim, Benjamin Constant, Atalaia do Norte) and Ecuador also illegally offer the meat for sale. Meat is sold in natura, or as ""mixira"" or subproducts such as sausage. The mixira, which is the meat preserved in its own fat, is one of the products that prolongs the pressure on the species, since it commands a high price.</p>  <p>Take estimates are available only for a few sites where conservation and research projects are taking place. Between 2002 and 2004, 64 Manatees were estimated to have been killed in the Amanã-Castanho area (3,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of Amanã SDR (Calvimontes 2009), most of them adult males. Between 2011 and 2015, the hunt count for the same area was 42 Manatees. Some 195 Manatees were estimated to have been killed between 2011 and 2015 in the Uatumã River valley (Brazil) through the expeditions of Project Protecting Life in Uatumã (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016). In the Urucu region of Brazil 20 Manatees were captured between 2004 and 2007, 14 harpooned and 6 entangled (Franzini <em>et al.</em> 2013). Pantoja (2015) estimated 92 Manatees hunted in the area of the lower Javari river, Brazil, between 1980 and 2014. Based on interviews conducted in the Piagaçu Purus SDR (Purus river, Brazil), approximately 460 Manatees were killed in the protected area between 2004 and 2014 (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Based on 48 interviews, 36 manatees were captured in the Region of the Middle Madeira and Aripuanã Rivers (Amazon, Brazil) between 1986-2004: 89% poached and 11% entangled (Castelblanco-Martínez<em> et al</em>. 2007).</p><p> </p>  <p>The Natütama Foundation, which has a year-round Manatee monitoring program in place since 2002, registered three Manatees hunted in Colombia from 2003 to 2013 (Kendall 2013) and more than six in Peru from 2010-2015. Manatees are still being hunted in the river Putumayo upstream from Tarapaca and above the mouth of the Igaraparana, according to interviews with local Colombian fishermen, who say most of the hunters are Peruvian (S. Kendall pers. obs.). </p>  <p>In the Pacaya Samiria Reserve (Peru), Soto (2007) estimated an average of 35 Manatees killed in the basins of the Punahua, Ucayali and Marañon rivers.</p>  <p><strong>Incidental mortality, orphaned calves, and illegal captivity</strong></p>  <p>In addition to specific gillnets to hunt Manatees, the high use of fishing nets in the Amazon has increased incidental calf mortality in the past few years. These events have been documented in all Amazonian Manatee range countries (Reeves<em> et al. </em>1996, Orozco 2001, Franzini 2008, Souza 2015), and this is now a major threat for the species (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>When calves survive drowning in nets, they may be kept alive for later sale<span lang=""EN-US""> as pets, kept in pools or areas close to water bodies, and sold or given to influential persons. The number of rescued calves every year has been increasing, but the number recorded represents a small sample of occurrences in the Amazon.</p>  <p>Between 2008 and 2010, in the Brazilian state of Pará, 28 stranded Manatees were rescued, of which only one was an adult (Sousa <em>et al. </em>2010). An important threat in Pará is the use of fishing corrals, as they are usually built over submerged aquatic vegetation beds, where Manatees feed, and have already trapped a Manatee (M. Sousa, pers. com. 2016).</p>  <p>Presently, several institutions in Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Centro de Pesquisa e Preservação de Mamíferos Aquáticos, Mamirauá Institute and Zoofit) care for over 150 Manatees in captivity, mostly orphans. Between 2005 and 2015, INPA received an average of 10 calves per year. Of the 98 animals rescued during this period, 30% were accidentally caught in fishing nets (D. Souza pers. obs). In the past 10 years CPPMA received 39 calves for rehabilitation (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016).</p>  <p>From 2010-2015, 3 calves died in nets or captivity in Peru (S. Kendall pers obs). It is estimated that two Amazonian Manatees are presently in captivity in Colombia (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>Between 2007 and 2010, Centro de Rescate Amazónico (Iquitos, Peru) rescued 28 Manatees (Perea <em>et al. </em>2011), and until 2013 successfully rehabilitated 25 individuals (Landeo-Yauri <em>et al. </em>2013). Since 2011 &#160;the Centro released and monitored 11 of those rehabilitated animals (Landeo and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Velásquez Varela <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p><strong>Habitat alteration and disturbance</strong></p>  <p>Other anthropogenic actions have resulted in pollution, loss, alteration, degradation and fragmentation of habitats used by the Amazonian Manatee (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). </p>  <p>Changes in the aquatic environment as habitat degradation due to deforestation, pollution, contamination of the rivers by mercury for the gold exploration (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 2000), pesticides and heavy metals from agricultural waste and oil spills are potential hazards to the Manatee´s food supply (Rosas <em>et al. </em>1991). These elements are absorbed by aquatic weeds and may directly affect the staple diet of the species (Rosas 1994). Roots of floating and rooted aquatic plants (<em>Paspalum, Eicchornia, Salvinia</em>) have been shown to be important methylation sites (Guimarães <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Over 300 dams are planned for the Amazon (Winemiller <em>et al. </em>2016), two of which are mega-enterprises in Brazil (Madeira and Xingu rivers). The building of dams can interfere with habitat quality, altering water speed, nutrient load and dynamics of macrophyte production (Junk and Nunes de Mello 1987). Brazil has extensive plans for navigation (Fearnside 2001, Brazil, PR, 2011) with dams allowing the opening of the waterway in the Tapajos river (Fearnside 2015) planned for soy transport, giving access to the Amazon river and the Atlantic ocean (Brazil, PR 2011, Millikan 2011).&#160;Amazonian Manatees are very sensitive to noise, and intense boat traffic on the Amazonian rivers can affect their behaviour and habitat use.</p>  <p>Oil spills may be a particular problem in Ecuador (Brice <em>et al. </em>2011, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013, Brice 2014), where oil exploitation has been permitted in important refuges for the species (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013). The use of fertilizers and weed control products in extensive monocultures (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013), incidental captures in fishing nets, the use of dynamite, the increasing use of motorized boats including in the Cuyabeno and Jatuncocha systems where there are nature tourism activities (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, b) are additional threats in Ecuador.</p>  <p>On the Peru-Colombia border, wood extraction activities are clogging lakes and stopping normal migrations of Manatees in the Atacuari area (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p>Amazonian human populations are generally at low densities except in the large capital cities, but all of the issues above could be magnified by the increase in human population.</p><p>Tourism and transport are interfering more and more with low water resting places in the area around Puerto Nariño (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>Around the city of Belém and estuary of the Amazon River, boat traffic is intense and even ferries and cargo ships may interfere with Manatee movement (Miranda Leão <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p><strong>Natural disasters, drought, climate change</strong></p><p>Extreme droughts may help make the Manatee an easier prey item for hunters, by causing isolation and entrapment. During the 2010 drought in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Purus River, Brazil), 180 Manatees were estimated killed (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014), but only a few cases of Manatees trapped by drought in the eastern Peruvian frontier area were recorded, and none in Colombia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p></p>","<p>Most of the waters inhabited by Amazonian Manatees are very murky and, probably as an adaptation to the past and ongoing hunting pressure, Amazonian Manatees are extremely secretive.&#160;T<span class=""alt-edited"">remendous<span class=""shorttext""> research efforts have been made,<span lang=""EN""> but&#160;there are no reliable population estimates available, although numbers are almost certainly lower than historical figures due to centuries of hunting. Analysis of feeding patches, direct sightings of <em>T. inunguis</em> and interview surveys have been used to try to estimate population numbers with limited results, due to opportunistic sightings and small samples without standardized effort. Traditional mark-recapture studies are not appropriate due to the species’ secretive nature. More recently there have been efforts to estimate populations with the use of rotary or side-scan sonars, but still with inconclusive results (Brice 2014, Francisco <em>et al.</em> 2015), which hinders the development of conservation strategies for the species. Magor empirically estimated a minimum population of 10,000 Amazonian Manatees for the Amazon basin (Husar 1977). Based on the analysis of mtDNA control region, Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>(2005) suggested a genetic estimate of the effective female population size of <em>T. inunguis</em> of approximately 455,000 individuals, indicative of a recent large population size. Genetic studies do not show a population structure throughout the region (Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p><p>In Colombia, due to conservation efforts with local communities, a reduction in hunting levels and an apparent increase in&#160;Amazonian&#160;Manatee population in specific sites has been noted in the last few years. In the Colombian Amazon, the population may have stabilized, but hunting continues on the Peruvian side of the river and this affects the Colombian population. During 2010-2015, Natütama registered 3 to 4 new calves every year in Colombia. Fishermen insist that there are more Manatees now, mainly because they see groups of 7 to 10 Manatees more often (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Systematic monitoring with former Manatee hunters recorded 364 sightings around Puerto Nariño in 2014, including five different calves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;</span><em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2015).</p><p>A study conducted 1996-1999 in Cuyabeno Reserve (Ecuador) contradicted Timm <em>et al.</em>'s<em>&#160;</em>(1986) prediction of extinction in 10 years. However, relative abundance in Cuyabeno River was 0.01 animal / h effort and 0.007 animal / h effort in Lagartococha River. A total 40-49 animals were sighted in the Cuyabeno Reserve between 1996 and 1998, where they are considered rare (Denkinger 2010). The use of sonar produced estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 individuals / 10 km in three sites (Parque Nacional Yasuni, Lagartococha and Cocaya lake systems); no animals were detected in 58 km of the Cuyabeno lagoon system (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Brice (2014), using side-scan sonar observed 24 individuals in 70 hours of sampling in the same region. In Ecuador the species is considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria C2a(i), which indicates an estimated population of less than 250 mature individuals, and no subpopulation with 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2001).</p><p>Guzmán (2014), also using a side scan sonar, recorded 14 Manatees in 65 km of rivers and lagoons, or 2.15 ind / 10 km in the Lagartococha river, on border Peru-Ecuador, an area partially surveyed by Utreras <em>et al. </em>(2013). Bodmer <em>et al. </em>(2006) believed the population in the Pacaya Samiria Reserve was stable due to a slight increase in counts between 2003 and 2006. However, Soto (2007) points out that the estimation method has not yet been proven.</p><p>In some sustainable development reserves (SDR) in Brazilian Amazon, hunting has been decreasing over the recent years. This is probably a reflection of the conservation actions that have occurred in the region, and the lack of interest among young fishermen for hunting the Manatee. The frequent records of sightings of adults and females with calves during the rainy and dry seasons in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Souza 2015) suggest that populations of <em>T. inunguis</em> may be stable or increasing in these regions.</p><p>Sixty two per cent&#160;of hunters interviewed by Calvimontes (2009) in Amanã SDR (Brazil) believed the population is decreasing, although they attribute this to Manatees having moved away (due to habitat alterations and increasing levels of noise) rather than hunting. Calvimontes also reported that most hunters are turning into farmers, which should decrease the pressure on the species.&#160;Seventy three&#160;per cent of interviewees in the Belém region (mouth of the Amazon) considered the Manatee population is decreasing, due to hunting, pollution, boat traffic and noise (Miranda 2014). Half of the respondents in Franzini <em>et al.</em>'s&#160;(2013) study believed Manatee numbers are declining.</p><p>Seventy&#160;per cent&#160;of interviewees in the Ucayali region of Peru believed the population is decreasing (Silva <em>et al. </em>2014). In a preliminary survey of Manatees in the Lagartococha region, in 6.9 km of canoe transects Hidalgo (2010) observed 16 Manatees and 25 feeding patches, which lead him to evaluate that Manatees in the Lagartococha river basin may be stable due to the almost null human presence.</p><p>The progressive increase in the number of young calves arriving at rehabilitation centres in Brazil in the past five years has also led several researchers to suspect that the species may be undergoing some recovery, or that the increase is simply a reflection of the awareness campaigns implemented, with a concomitant increase in the number of rescued calves (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005). Alternatively, it may also suggest that calf takes are on the rise.</p><p>Although Manatees are widespread through a large area, there is a high level of uncertainty about population size, as no reliable method for determining abundance has been defined so far. Whatever the current population size, the overall population trend is most likely to be decreasing, given the species’ slow reproduction (sirenian populations grow at an annual rate of approximately 5-6%; Marsh<em> et al. </em>2004, 2011) and levels of exploitation (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 1992). In summary, although the population may be stabilizing in some parts of the Amazon region due to local awareness building and other conservation efforts, the overall trend is of a decreasing population.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Amazonian Manatees occur in northern South America, and are endemic to the Amazon Basin. Amazonian Manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, in river and lake systems, from the headwaters, in Colombia (Domning 1981), Ecuador (Timm <em>et al. </em>1986) and Peru (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1996) to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Marajó Island) in Brazil (Best and Teixeira 1982, Miranda 2014) over an estimated seven million square kilometres. However, they are patchily distributed, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km² (Junk 1997), but are limited by troubled waters (rapids and falls) and aquatic vegetation (Best 1983).</p>  <p>In Ecuador most records are from the extreme northeast, below 250 m altitude. From north to south there are records for the Güeppi river (tributary of Putumayo, in the border with Colombia), the Aguarico river and its Cuyabeno and Lagartococha systems, where most of the records come from (Denkinger 2010, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in tributaries such as the Yanayacu, Cocaya and Zancudococha lagoon; in the Napo region they are found in the Añangu, Challuacocha and Yuturi lagoon systems, as well as in the Tiputini river and Yasuní basin, including the Jatuncocha and Tambococha lagoon systems (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a). In Peru they occur in the Loreto region in the Samiria, Pacaya, Marañón, Pastaza, Ucayali, Huallaga, Purus, Tapiche, Yarapa and Yanayacu rivers, as well as in the lower Puinahua and Iricahua rivers in the Ucayali basin; their occurrence has been mentioned for the Nanay, Orosa, Yavarí, Yaguas and Putumayo rivers, and in the Reserva&#160; Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, and in the Yanayacu-Pucate river (Silva 2010); in Colombia in the Putumayo, Amazon and lower Caquetá rivers; in Brazil they occur in most major river basins such as Solimões, Japurá, Juruá, Purus, Negro and Tapajós.</p>  <p>Although there are no records in the Guyana, the species may occasionally penetrate into southern Guiana close to the boundary with Brazil (Bertram and Bertram 1963). This possibility is enhanced by a Manatee rescue done by INPA in Takutu River border Brazil and Guyana (D. Souza pers. obs).</p>","<p>The historical main use of <em>T. inunguis</em> was to obtain oil, skin and meat (Domning 1982). In remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 Manatees were killed between 1935 and 1954, not counting subsistence hunting (Best 1983, Rosas and Pimentel 2001), which still persists in modern times.</p><p>  </p><p>Currently, the main use of the species is for food. Manatee meat is highly valued, but all the other products are used as well (fat and skin are used in cooking and as medicine, bones are turned into utilitarian pieces and charms, and the skin produces very resistant leather). Medicinal uses are attributed to the fat being rubbed on the affected area (rheumatism and paralysis) and skin (helping the healing process of wounds and infections) (Miranda 2014). A Manatee is held for show to tourists in Puerto Alegria, Peru, upstream from Leticia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Manatees are protected by national laws in all countries of confirmed distribution (Brazil since 1967, Colombia since 1969, Peru since 1973 (Silva 2009) and Ecuador since 2002 (Tirira 2011)). Listed under Appendix I of CITES, signed by the four countries, also signatories of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. All but Colombia are parties to the Convention on Migratory Species.</p><p>Presently there are national management plans specific for the species in Colombia (Dirección de Ecosistemas 2005) and Brazil (Andrade <em>et al.</em> 2011) and for aquatic mammals (including Manatees) in Ecuador (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Management plans exist for two protected areas (Pacaya Samiria in Peru and Mamiraua Reserve in Brazil), and Puerto Nariño (Colombia) has informal local management agreement (S. Kendall pers. obs).</p><p>In 2014 the Biodiversity department of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador included Manatee as a focal species for conservation, and relative abundance studies are planned for the Cuyabeno-Yasuni corridor in the Napo river basin between 2016 and 2018. The same department is attempting to have the corridor between the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve and the Yasuní National Park recognized as a RAMSAR site (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2016)</p><p>Amazonian Manatees have been recorded from two protected areas in Ecuador, three in Colombia, four in Peru and at least 53 in Brazil (D. Souza pers. obs). Unfortunately, hunting continues even within protected areas.</p><p>Some 90% of the possible area of distribution of Manatees in Colombia is outside of protected areas. In Colombia the conservation work has been greatly based on participation of local communities (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). Efforts include year-round conservation and monitoring by the Natütama Foundation in the key areas of the Colombian Amazon, with information network for nearby areas; intensive education program<a name=""_GoBack""></a> in the Colombian Amazon, with occasional visits to Tarapaca on the Putumayo river; release of calves by fishermen in the Colombian Amazon (Kendall 2013): 4 releases from nets from 2010-2015 by Natutama and associated fishermen (S. Kendall pers obs).</p><p>Ex-situ research at INPA captive setting (Brazil) and in Amazon Rescue Center (Peru)&#160;is providing the most information about the ecology and biology of the Amazonian Manatee, as reproductive hormone dosages, morphometric, allometric and growth studies of individuals, determination of nutritional parameters of milk in different states of lactation, evaluation of the animal health status, vocalization and acoustic ontogeny, among others.</p><p>Efforts of releasing rehabilitated Manatees back to the wild have been conducted by Mamirauá Institute (Marmontel 2012, 2015), INPA (Rosas and da Silva 2008, Souza <em>et al. </em>2012), ICMBio (Luna <em>et al. </em>2012) in Brazil, Amazon Rescue Center (Landeo-Yauri and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Sánchez-Babilonia 2015) in Peru, and Omacha Foundation in Colombia (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Release efforts have been coupled with intense educational campaigns. Post-release monitoring has shown that most of the releases were successful.</p><p>&#160;Recommended actions for the conservation of the species include:</p><p></p><ul><li>Estimate the population size and the effective range of the Amazonian Manatee, developing specific techniques for the sighting of the species</li><li>Given the elusive manatee condition and the dark waters, other indirect methods need to be continue used for      estimates, such as interviews, catch records, bycatch, and stranding      records</li><li>Set the migration routes across the distribution area of the species and understand the habitat use along the flood pulse of the Amazon rivers</li><li>Elucidate the hybridization processes in the Amazonian estuary region with further studies on the chromosomal evolution of Manatee species</li><li>Create a broad awareness and environmental education program with emphasis in the areas with pressure of intense hunting of <em>T. inunguis</em></li><li>Intensify the supervision and monitor the hunting activities within the protected areas in the long term</li><li>Carry out the studbook of the captive Manatees to verify the consanguinity degree</li><li>Improve the established protocols of reintroduction of rehabilitated animals and post release monitoring techniques</li><li>Offer livelihood, economic alternatives or other incentives for stakeholders involved in Manatee conservation pressures, especially hunting</li></ul><p></p><p>                                </p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

45197343,6082,Cynogale bennettii,Endangered,C1,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Otter Civet is listed as Endangered because of a presumed small and declining population. Based on data in&#160;Miettinen&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011), the presumed primary habitat for Otter Civet has been greatly reduced historically and has declined by about 20% over the last two generations (presumed to be 10 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The remaining habitat is discontinuous, often degraded; and water sources, presumed to be important for the species, are often polluted. As a ground-dwelling species snares will also be a threat. The population is therefore likely to have declined by substantially more than 20% in the last 10 years.<br/><br/>A map of the area of Otter Civet occupancy for Borneo predicted an area of potentially occupied habitat of 261,614 km². Applying the same reasoning regarding habitat suitability, an additional 44,094 km² and 34,999 km² could plausibly be available in Sumatra and the Thai-Malay peninsula, respectively. Despite this relatively large area of suitable habitat, Otter Civet is rarely recorded by camera-trap (or other survey method) in the vast majority of its range, even in areas assumed to be good habitat, for example, the peat swamp forests of Sabangau National Park (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010) or Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald pers. comm. 2014). A review of small carnivore records from Thailand did not trace any camera-trap records of Otter Civet and no records from any method since 1998; it might be on the verge of national extinction (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Records are also infrequent from Peninsular Malaysia (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006), with apparently only two records&#160;since 1990 (M. Gumal pers comm. 2014).&#160;As of late 2014, there are no records from Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Than Zaw pers. comm. 2014). It has been recorded more frequently in at least two areas of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, both logged lowland forest, with data from one of these areas indicating a breeding population (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010, A.J. Hearn and J. Ross&#160;pers comm. 2014). However, it is unclear why these two surveys resulted in comparatively high detection rates; surveys in adjacent forest reserves using similar techniques resulted in few records, suggesting that these apparent higher abundances are very localised. Records from Sumatra are also few, although in some areas detections are more frequent than in its mainland range (ZSL Indonesia Programme pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Although Otter Civet seems able to tolerate some forms of habitat disturbance such as logging, it has never been recorded in plantations and its tolerance to each form of habitat disturbance remains unknown. The paucity of records across most of its range, despite intensive and/or long-term camera-trapping in some areas, suggests that it probably exists at very low densities range-wide, although this might vary much. Across its range, average densities might be as low as 1-2 individuals per 100 km² (inferred from very low detection rates in most areas), especially because&#160;it is plausible that the distribution is very patchy with large areas where Otter Civet is no longer present, despite suitable habitat and other areas where densities are higher locally. The number of mature individuals is therefore plausibly fewer than 2,500 (equivalent to a total population of around 3,800) indicating (in combination with the suspected decline rate) a categorisation as Endangered under C1. The large uncertainty in this assessment means Vulnerable is similarly plausible: continuation of the 2008&#160;Endangered&#160;listing is explicitly precautionary. In some areas, the lack of camera-trap records might reflect inappropriate camera-trap placement; the overall few detections might reflect the rarity of surveys in prime Otter Civet habitat. Should future survey results challenge the key assumptions urging a cautious approach (near-restriction to gentle terrain, predominantly lowland; high sensitivity to conversion, degradation and fragmentation of forested wetlands, to pollution and to hunting; and a generally low density with only highly localised higher densities) the Red List categorisation would need revising. It is likely that it would then meet the criteria for Vulnerable under A2 and A3 (which it comfortably meets at present based on coarse habitat loss rates) and C1.","Little is known of Otter Civet&#160;habitat and ecology. This species was believed to be confined&#160;largely&#160;to peat swamp forests, but there are now also&#160;records from lowland dipterocarp forest (Sebastian 2005, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. in prep.). It seems to be most strongly associated with lowland primary forest, but it has been recorded in secondary forest, bamboo, and logged forest (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006, Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010, A.J. Hearn and J. Ross pers. comm. 2014); its long-term persistence in these habitats is unknown (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006). It has also been recorded in freshwater swamp forest and in limestone forest amid acacia plantation in Bukit Sarang Conservation Area, Sarawak (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007). It has been recorded at 1,370 m a.s.l. in Bario, Sarawak, but the majority of records are from lowland forest (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. in prep.).&#160;Otter Civet is semi-aquatic (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006) and is&#160;assumed to forage in water for fish, crabs, molluscs, small mammals, and birds (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). It is predominantly nocturnal (Sebastian 2005, Ross <em>et al</em>. in prep. a).","Reduction in primary forest habitat has proceeded very fast throughout the lowland Sundaic region in the last 20 years (e.g.,&#160;Holmes 2000,&#160;BirdLife International 2001, Jepson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Kinnaird&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames <em>et al.</em> 2005, Miettinen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Stibig&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This has probably reduced Otter Civet&#160;populations by at least the rate of forest loss.&#160;Silting and general pollution of waterways associated with the logging of forests and chemical pollution from activities such as gold mining may also be disproportionally detrimental to this semi-aquatic civet. Conversion of peat swamp forests to oil palm plantations is likely to be a major threat particularly to this species. There is no evidence that the species is specifically hunted, but as a ground-dwelling species it will be exposed to the snares and ground-level traps set for other species. The number of animals caught and effect on the population are unknown.","Very little is known about Otter Civet population trends and abundance. Sebastian (2005) considered&#160;its apparent rarity, deduced from a low detection frequency even in heavily surveyed areas, to be puzzling. It is important to determine whether low detection rates reflect bias in choice of survey areas and/or survey methods, or stem from naturally low population densities. All evidence suggests that it is forest dependent and possibly is dependent on clear and unpolluted water sources; therefore it is reasonable to assume the population is in decline. Although it has been detected in logged forest, population densities are likely to be lower there than in primary forest (see&#160;Heydon and Bulloh 1996).",Decreasing,"Otter Civet has a Sundaic distribution. It is found in Malaysia (peninsular and Borneo), Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo), Brunei Darussalam and Thailand. Assuming the&#160;sight-record at Kaeng Krachan in the north of peninsula&#160;Thailand is valid (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), the species is likely also to occur in Peninsular Myanmar, although there are no records from Myanmar to date. With no specific search for the species and very little general survey in the relevant parts of the country, this lack of records does not strongly suggest the species’ absence&#160;(Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Than Zaw pers. comm. 2014). There is a very old record labelled as from Singapore (Meiri 2005) but there is no evidence that this was not a traded specimen, and no other indication that the&#160;species has&#160;ever occurred in the country&#160;(Chua <em>et al</em>. 2012). A 1920s record from northern Viet Nam was assumed by Veron <em>et al</em>. (2006) to have an erroneous provenance. Three subsequent reports from Yunnan province, China, and one from non-Sundaic Thailand, which lent an appearance of mutual corroboration to the Viet Nam locality, are based only on second-hand reports and have not been verified with either specimens or photographs (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989, Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2013). Therefore, the&#160;species is&#160;taken here not to occur outside&#160;Sundaic&#160;Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Recent records of Otter Civet from Borneo are from Sarawak (e.g., Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007), Sabah (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010, A.J. Hearn and J. Ross pers. comm. 2014) and Central Kalimantan (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010). There are also recent records from east-central Sumatra (ZSL Indonesia Programme pers. comm. 2014). As of late 2014, only two recent records were traced from the Thai-Malay peninsula, both from the Endau-Rompin Landscape, Johor, Malaysia: once each in 2012 and 2013 (M. Gumal pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Otter Civet has been recorded at 1,370 m a.s.l. in Bario, Sarawak, but the majority of records are from lowland forest, down to sea-level (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cheyne <em>et al</em>. in prep.).","There is no known specific demand for Otter Civet, but because much mammal-hunting in its range uses non-selective techniques, it is likely to be part of the general off-take of wild meat and, like other civets, eaten.",Terrestrial,"Otter Civet is listed in Appendix II of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora,&#160;and as ‘threatened’ in the <em>IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids</em> (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989). Its conservation requires protection of forest and riverine habitat, and policing against illegal harvesting of timber and hunting (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006). Conservation priorities would be better refined by clarification of its tolerance to degraded, fragmented, secondary and converted habitats, including riverine areas in plantations and other areas that maintain some natural vegetation, and its&#160;occurrence in the various types of wetland habitat. The paucity of recent records in the&#160;Thai-Malay peninsular, despite an increase in the use of camera-traps, is of great concern, and warrants specific search for the species.<br/><br/>This species has been detected in a fair number of protected areas throughout its range, including Bukit Sarang Conservation Area, Sarawak (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007), Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand, in 1998 (Anon. 1998), Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2006), Sembilang National Park, Sumatra (ZSL Indonesia Programme pers. comm. 2014), Danau Sentarum National Park, West Kalimantan (Jeanes and Meijaard 2000), Danum Valley Conservation Area and Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah (A.J.

Foraging intervals are shorter for Cape Fur Seals (an average of 5.2 days) than Australian Fur Seals (six days), probably reflecting greater availability of food (Gamel <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2005, Kirkwood and Arnould 2011). While some pups may start foraging at seven months, they are usually weaned at 10-12 months, with suckling rarely continuing for two to three years (</span>Warneke and Shaughnessy 1985, David and Rand 1986).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">While Cape Fur Seals forage in both pelagic and benthic environments (Kooyman and Gentry 1986,&#160;</span></span></span>David 1987b, Stewardson 2001), Australian Fur Seals are primarily benthic feeders (Arnould and Kirkwood 2008, Kirkwood and Arnould 2011, Kirkwood and Goldsworthy 2013). Characteristics of dives vary between sites (Kooyman and Gentry 1986, Stewardson 2001, Arnould and Kirkwood 2008, Kirkwood and Arnould 2011). The majority of recorded dives of Cape Fur Seals on the west coast of South Africa are to less than 50 m depth (Kooyman and Gentry 1986), while those on the southeast coast are to more than 60 m (Stewardson 2001). Mean dive duration of Cape Fur Seals varies between one minute (Stewardson 2001) and 2.1 minutes (Kooyman and Gentry 1986). Foraging dives by lactating Australian Fur Seal females are usually to 65–85 m with a maximum depth of 164 m, and dives usually last from 2.0-3.7 minutes, with a maximum duration of 8.9 minutes (Arnould and Hindell 2001). The diurnal frequency of Cape Fur Seal dives shows a bimodal distribution with most dives taking place at dusk or during the first half of the night, with a smaller peak after dawn (Kooyman and Gentry 1986, Stewardson 2001).

Under protection, both have recovered, although the Cape subspecies to a much greater extent than the Australian subspecies, which has not returned to estimated pre-exploitation levels (Kirkman<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013; Kirkwood<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Levels of exploitation of Cape Fur Seals were not as severe as those experienced by other species of Fur Seals and genetic variation remains high (Matthee<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""> Harvests of Cape Fur Seals in South Africa were first controlled in 1893 and were suspended in 1990 (Wickens<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1991). Harvesting continues in Namibia at the mainland colonies of Cape Cross and the Wolf and Atlas Bays group (Japp<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Harvest levels have remained high even in years with high levels of pup and adult natural mortality (Japp<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Kirkman<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). This mortality has been attributed to a scarcity of fish and poor marine productivity along the coast of Namibia, which occurs at intervals (Gammelsrød<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Gerber and Hilborn 2001). Australian Fur Seals are not harvested.<br/> <br/> The foraging distributions of both subspecies overlap extensively with commercial fishing activities, especially trawl fisheries operating in southeastern Australia (David 1987b<span class=""apple-converted-space"">, Wickens<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992,&#160;</span>Goldsworthy<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Fisheries interactions therefore constitute one of the most important threats to the species, and especially for the less abundant Australian Fur Seal (v, National Seal Strategy Group and Stewardson 2007). This subspecies is subject to significant and ongoing bycatch mortality associated with demersal and mid-water trawling operations, and they constitute a significant bycatch in the mid-water trawl sector of the small pelagic fishery (Knuckey<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002,&#160;Hamer and Goldsworthy 2006<span class=""apple-converted-space"">, Tilzey<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006,&#160;&#160;Lyle and Willcox 2008, Tuck<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). Ecological interactions with fisheries also pose a potential threat, given their reliance on small pelagics (</span>Goldsworthy<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Deagle<em>et al</em>. 2009<span class=""apple-converted-space"">). Australian Fur Seals also interact regularly with finfish (Salmon) aquaculture farms in Tasmania (Pemberton and Shaughnessy 1993, Hume<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, National Seal Strategy Group and Stewardson 2007, Robinson<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008).

A number of commercially exploited species of fish are eaten by Seals (David 1987b, Wickens<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992). While the effects of these interactions are difficult to assess due to the complexities of the marine food web and the range of species that Seals prey on (David 1987b, Punt and Butterworth 1995), it is possible that changes in fishing effort and changes in the abundance and distribution of commercially harvested fish species may result in reduced prey populations (Barange<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999,&#160;</span></span>Roy<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Moloney<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Roux<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013<span class=""apple-converted-space"">). The impact of direct mortality of Cape Fur Seals due to fisheries is not well known and the effects of current interactions have not been studied. Seals have been taken incidentally in past fishing operations and levels of take have been estimated to be low (Wickens<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992,&#160;</span>David and Wickens 2003<span class=""apple-converted-space"">).

It is also possible that climate change was responsible for recent periods of high mortality along the Namibian coast (Gammelsrød<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Gerber and Hilborn 2001). Pups are vulnerable to high temperatures (De Villiers and Roux 1992), and changes leading to higher ambient temperatures and fewer windy days may increase mortality (Kovacs<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).

However, there have been substantial changes in distribution during this time period with an increase in the number of colonies, a northward shift in range and an increase in abundance in some areas (northern Namibia and northwestern South Africa; Kirkman<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In 2004 some 75% of Cape Fur Seals bred at three sites: the Atlas Bay-Wolf Bay-Long Islands Complex and Cape Cross in Namibia, and Kleinzee in South Africa (Kirkman<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). All of these sites have experienced small declines in abundance since that time (Kirkman<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). Most of the smaller rookeries are estimated to contain more than 1,000 adults. While the abundances of the larger rookeries are relatively stable, they do experience fluctuations. Fluctuations are greater in southern Namibian rookeries (Kirkman<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013) which have experienced major mortality events due to the impact of poor environmental conditions on prey populations (Gammelsrød<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Gerber and Hilborn 2001). Smaller rookeries tend to experience greater fluctuations than larger rookeries (Kirkman<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, 2013).<br/> <br/> Australian Fur Seal pup production has been assessed during three national surveys at approximately five-year intervals since 2002/03. These have indicated a mean annual increase in pup production between 1986 and 2002/03 of 5%, slowing to 0.3% per year between 2002/03 and 2007/08 seasons. It is not clear if the apparent 6% per year decline between the 2007/08 and 2013/14 estimates is due to a poor pupping season in 2013/14, or represents a real decline in population over that period, as no colonies are monitored on an annual basis. The most recent estimate (2013/14) of pup production was 15,063 (McIntosh<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Based on the 2007/08 surveys, two colonies adjacent to the Victorian coast, Seal Rocks (5,660 pups) and Lady Julia Percy Island (5,574 pups), account for 51% the total pup production.

In 2010, 43,168 pups and 4,573 adult males were harvested, while the 2011 harvest was 45,794 pups and 3,626 adult males (Japp <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>The Australian Fur Seal is not harvested.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Australian Fur Seals are protected nationally by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999). They are also protected in all Australian states in which they occur by state-specific legislation (National Seal Strategy Group and Stewardson 2007).<br/><br/>Although Cape Fur Seals have been protected in South Africa since 1893 by the Fish Protection Act, and in Namibia since 1922 by the Sealing and Fisheries Proclamation, they were still subject to government run or government authorized commercial harvests (Wickens&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991,&#160;Butterworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995, David and Wickens 2003).

45227116,13581,Mirounga angustirostris,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Northern Elephant Seal has recovered from near extinction and population growth is expected to continue over the coming decades. Due to its large and increasing population, expanding range and lack of foreseeable threats, the Northern Elephant Seal is listed as Least Concern.<br/></p>","Northern Elephant Seals are the second largest species in the order Pinnipedia and they display significant sexual dimorphism in size and secondary sexual characteristics (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 1994). Males are three to four times heavier, and nearly 1.5 times the length, of adult females. Adult males reach 4.2 m in length and a maximum weight of 2,500 kg. Mean length for males is 3.85 m and mean weight is 1,844 kg. Maximum weight is seen when the bulls are newly arrived for the breeding season after a summer and fall largely spent feeding (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 1990). The mean length of adult females is 2.65 m, and they can reach a length of 2.82 m. Mean mass is 488 kg, with a maximum recorded mass of 710 kg, both values are from shortly after females give birth. Newborn pups are about 1.25 m long and weigh 30-40 kg. Pups are born in a long woolly black lanugo coat that is shed without the epidermis starting at about 4-5 weeks and usually lasting several weeks until after the pup is weaned (Reiter <em>et al</em>. 1981). After molting, the newly weaned juvenile’s coat is made up of short hairs like those found on adults and they are counter shaded dark grey above and silver grey below.<br/><br/>During the time on land for breeding or molting, Elephant Seals undergo a complete fast (no food or water) and their body weight declines dramatically due to the demands of lactation (females) and defending territories (males) in the breeding season, and growth of new hair and skin during the molt (Champagne <em>et al</em>. 2012). Adult females can lose almost half their mass during lactation, when they take their single pup from birth to weaning in approximately 25 days. The situation is similar for breeding males, which also lose about half their mass while ashore for periods that can exceed three months.<br/><br/>Females reach sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years and males at 7-9 years. Gestation lasts 11.3 months, including a delay of implantation. The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is 95%. Longevity is more than 14 years for males and 21 years for females (Condit <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Northern Elephant Seals are highly polygynous, but not strictly territorial. Males compete for access to females by ranking themselves in a hierarchy. There is much male-male fighting, vocalizing, and displaying during the breeding season, when bulls may be ashore for months at a time (LeBeouf 1972). One of the most impressive displays occurs when a male rears up on his hindquarters, thrusts one half to two-thirds of his body upward and produces a distinctive clap threat vocalization as a challenge to other bulls. The sound is a rolling, resonant, metallic-sounding series of backfire-like sounds punctuated with pauses (Sanvito and Galimberti 2003).<br/><br/>Females give birth within a few days of coming ashore, from late December to March. They have a throaty sputtering growl, made with the mouth wide-open, which is used as threat signal. Females and pups have a warbling scream that they use to call to each other, and in the case of the pup, to notify its mother when it is disturbed (LeBeouf 1972). Mother and pup form a strong bond immediately after birth, and females aggressively bite other pups that approach them, occasionally killing them with bites to the head (LeBeouf 1972). However, bulls are a greater source of pup mortality as they regularly crush pups when they charge through aggregations of mothers and pups to chase off or fight encroaching males, or when approaching females for mating. Occasionally, bulls suffocate pups by stopping on top of them and not moving again soon enough (Spraker <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Northern Elephant Seals are one of the deepest and longest diving marine mammals. Time-depth recording devices have documented dives deeper than 1,700 m and as long as 109 minutes by adult females. Rest intervals at the surface are usually short, lasting only several minutes between dives that have an average duration of 23 minutes and depth of 520 m (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). After leaving the rookeries, most Elephant Seals spend 80-90% of their time underwater, helping explain why they are infrequently seen at sea.<br/><br/>The diet of Northern Elephant Seals is largely unknown due to difficulties associated with identifying prey for such a wide-ranging species. Observations based on scat and stomach content analysis of animals on land have identified squid and mesopelagic fish as the main items consumed. New evidence from animals sampled at the Año Nuevo colony (northern California) on diet composition from biochemical techniques indicates that adult females are eating approximately 51% squid, 23% myctophids, and other mesopelagic fish (C. Goetsch pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Great White Sharks and Killer Whales are predators on Northern Elephant Seals (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1981). Recent work at the rookeries has revealed that large Great White Sharks aggregate around these sites when Elephant Seals return to haul out (Klimley <em>et al</em>. 2001). Seals that swim at or near the surface as they are approaching or departing the islands are particularly vulnerable to ambush attacks by fast-rising sharks that patrol near the bottom in waters 7-10 meters deep.","Incidental take of Northern Elephant Seals does occur in a variety of coastal net fisheries, but at low levels. This is assumed to be because they move offshore rapidly after leaving colonies to minimize their risk of predation. Anecdotal information points out to an increase in the number individuals observed entangled on land, perhaps as a consequence of the overlap between their at-sea foraging range and the “North Pacific garbage patch”. Some of the lesions caused by these entanglements could lead to the death of individuals, but there are no data on the rate of animals entangled and their survival. Most of the prey of the Northern Elephant Seal is either of low or no commercial fishery value. If the population continues to expand there will likely be new rookeries on mainland beaches, and there will be additional challenges to keep conflicts with humans and domestic and feral animals to a minimum. The risk of transfer of diseases, such as morbillivirus from domestic animals to Northern Elephant Seals, is unknown, but the species is considered to be one of several pinnipeds at high risk of disease outbreaks because of their rapidly expanding population and environmental changes associated with global warming (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990). Tourism at several mainland locations in the United States is extremely popular but highly regulated and is not considered a major threat to the species. Tourist access to nearly all of&#160; the islands occupied by Elephant Seals is controlled by law or otherwise regulated in the United States and Mexico, although a number of Mexican islands are inhabited either year round or most of the year by fishermen and their families.<br/><br/>As the species has now recovered from a very small number of survivors, it has likely lost a considerable amount of diversity from passing through this genetic bottleneck, and may now be at greater risk from disease outbreaks and environmental change.","Northern Elephant Seals were a prime target for commercial sealing, and the population was nearly extirpated by hunting during 1818-1869. Due to their pelagic nature, the fact that most animals spend 80% or more of their lives at sea, and that they do all not return to their rookeries at the same time, a few individuals were able to survive the wholesale slaughters at rookery sites. By 1890 only one group of about 100 animals was known to exist (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1990). Following a slow recovery in the early 1900s, Northern Elephant Seals recolonized formerly used sites throughout the 1980s. The total population size in 2010 was estimated to be between 210,000 and 239,000 animals (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014). Information for the population in Mexico needs to be updated, but at least for US waters most of the growth in population size has been associated with an increase in the size and number of rookeries in southern California’s Channel Islands. At rookeries in the USA, the population grew at a rate of 17% per year during 1958-1987, slowing to a growth rate of 3.8% per year during 1988-2010 (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Increasing,"Northern Elephant Seals are a wide ranging pelagic species that occurs throughout most of the eastern Pacific Ocean north of the 27°N latitude, from the coast of Baja California to the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, westward to about the International Dateline (180° longitude) (Le Boeuf et al. 2000, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Breeding takes place on offshore islands and at a few mainland localities from central Baja California, Mexico, to Northern California, USA. The species breeds at over 15 discrete locations, of which a dozen are well-known and occur mostly on islands of southern California and Baja California (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014). A few pups are born in Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia.<br/><br/>Adult Northern Elephant Seals migrate to and from their rookeries twice a year, returning once to breed during December-March and again later in the year (April-August) for several weeks to molt, at different times depending on sex and age (LeBeouf <em>et al</em>. 2000). They also show up at additional coastal sites as far north as southern Oregon for molting. Their post-breeding and post-molt migrations take most females north and west to oceanic areas of the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska twice a year (LeBeouf <em>et al</em>. 2000, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Adult males, on the other hand, tend to occupy the shelf break along the Aleutian Islands. Few movement data are available for younger age classes and consequently their at-sea distribution is poorly known. Vagrants have been documented in Japan and at the Midway Islands.","The Northern Elephant Seal was heavily exploited for its oil during 1818-1869, after which it was commercially extinct (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960). Few animals remained and in the 1900s they were completely protected by both Mexico and the U.S.",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>In the USA, Northern Elephant Seals are fully protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In Mexico, Elephant Seals are protected from direct harvest under the Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM-059-ECOL-2001).

45230540,41668,Zalophus wollebaeki,Endangered,A2ab,2015,2014-10-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Galápagos Sea Lion population declined by 60-65% from 1978 to 2001. Since then there is no evidence of further decline or increase; therefore it is likely that the population has still undergone a reduction of more than 50% over the last three generations (1984-2014). The causes of the reduction are partly understood, have not ceased, and may not be reversible. Impacts from El Niño events and infectious diseases continue to threaten the population. Galápagos Sea Lions qualify for listing as EN under criterion A2ab.  However, the lack of quantitative survey information for the past 13 years greatly increases the uncertainty of this assessment.<em></em>","Galápagos Sea Lions are very similar in appearance to California Sea Lions (<em>Zalophus californianus</em>), but are smaller and differ slightly in behaviour and skull morphology. Galápagos Sea Lions are sexually dimorphic, with males larger than females and having a suite of secondary sexual characteristics. The degree of sexual dimorphism appears to be less than in California Sea Lions, although few weights and measurements are available for adults to confirm this suggestion. Adult males are estimated to weigh up to 200 kg, but direct measurements outside the reproductive period showed a maximum of 158 kg (Trillmich <em>et al</em>. 2014). Adult females caring for pups weigh between 50 and 95 kg (mean 60 kg, Trillmich et al. 2014). Pups of both sexes are born already size dimorphic. Male newborns weigh on average 6.7 kg, females 5.8 kg (Kraus et al. 2013). Young are weaned when 1-3 years old at approximately 25-45 kg. Pups are born with a brownish-black lanugo coat that fades to pale brown by three to five months. Pups go through their first moult at around five to six months of age and emerge with the pelage of adult females and juveniles.<br/><br/>Female age at first birth is around six years (Trillmich <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data) and males are believed to mature sexually at about the same age, although male social maturity is attained at older age. Females produce one pup after a gestation of about 11 months, but may fail to become pregnant or abort if they are still caring for an older offspring (Trillmich and Wolf 2008). Longevity is estimated to be 15-24 years but the higher ages are not confirmed (Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993).<br/><br/>Galápagos Sea Lions are polygynous and males hold territories mostly along the shoreline in shallow water that they vociferously and aggressively defend. Male tenure on territories usually lasts from a few days to one month. Males may be more than once on territory during the drawn out reproductive period. Most copulations occur in the water.<br/><br/>Pupping and breeding take place across an extended period from May through February. The timing varies among islands within the archipelago. Because of the protracted breeding season and extended care provided to offspring (up to three years) by females, there are dependent offspring on the rookeries year-round. Females may wean offspring in 11-12 months in productive years or areas, but most continue to suckle yearlings for a second year. Some females care for a yearling along with a newborn pup. Pups are attended continuously for the first 4-7 days after birth, after which the female goes to sea to feed. With the departure, the female begins a cycle of foraging trips that last 0.5-3 days during the cold season, but may last considerably longer in the warm season. Pups will enter the water and begin to develop swimming skills 1-2 weeks after birth. In some colonies, females return at night to nurse their pup, departing again the next morning (Trillmich 1986). Females and pups recognize each other and reunite based on calls and scent (Trillmich 1981). Galápagos Sea Lion females feed during day and night, in contrast to Galápagos Fur Seals, which primarily feed at night (Jeglinski <em>et al</em>. 2013; Villegas-Amtmann <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013).<br/><br/>Galápagos Sea Lions are non-migratory. They are rather unafraid of humans when ashore, at least in the sites where they regularly encounter humans. Haul-out sites can be on rugged shoreline types, including steep rocky shorelines, ledges and offshore stacks, but colonies are mostly on gently sloping sandy and rocky beaches. Sea lions will use shade from vegetation, rocks, and cliffs, and enter tidal and drainage pools or move into the ocean, as needed during the heat of the day to avoid overheating.<br/><br/>Diving has been studied on Fernandina, Floreana, Caamaño and San Cristóbal. The maximum dive depth recorded for an adult female was 584 m and mean maximal duration was 9.8 minutes (Jeglinski <em>et al</em>. 2013). Average depth of dives varied between 45 and 94 m and dives lasted for 3-5 minutes (Villegas-Amtmann <em>et al</em>. 2008, Jeglinski <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2013). Galápagos Sea Lion females mostly use shelf areas for foraging. When resting at sea they will raft at the surface with one or more flippers held vertically in the air.<br/><br/>Galápagos Sea Lions prey on sardines (Dellinger and Trillmich 1999) as well as myctophids and bathylagids together with small squid. Diet breadth apparently varies across years and perhaps also seasonally and appears to be influenced by El Niño events (Paez-Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2014). During El Niño events prey includes green-eyes and myctophids, suggesting a change in foraging strategy.<br/><br/>Feral and uncontrolled dogs have been reported to kill Sea Lion pups and bite juveniles and adults. Shark predation is evident from animals seen with injuries and scars from attacks, and killer whales are presumed to be another predator on Galápagos Sea Lions. Interestingly, juvenile and adult Galápagos Sea Lions have been observed to mob Galápagos sharks that approach colonies, and also at haul out sites and resting places in shallow bays (Trillmich 1996).","Population abundance has fluctuated widely due to die-offs and cessation of reproduction during strong El Niño events, when marine productivity collapses (Trillmich and Limberger 1985, Trillmich and Dellinger 1991). During strong El Niños, 100% of pups, 50% of yearlings, and substantial numbers of adults may die (Limberger 1985; Trillmich and Dellinger 1991). Smaller El Niños likely have more subtle, but possibly still significant, effects on productivity and survival. Epidemics of unknown causation have occurred during El Niño events, adding to the stress on Sea Lions from low food abundance.<br/><br/>Oceanographers differ in their predictions of how the frequency and intensity of El Niño events may change with climate warming. Cai <em>et al</em>. (2014) suggest that the total number of El Niño events will decrease slightly, but the total number of extreme events will double as global warming continues. In contrast, Santoso <em>et al</em>. (2013) predict a doubling of the frequency of El Niño events with global warming. In the historical long-term perspective offered by Cobb <em>et al</em>. (2014) the frequency of El Niño during the last 50 years is unusually high, but still within the range of variability observed over the last 7,000 years. The most likely projection seems to be that El Niño events will be more frequent, and perhaps stronger, in the immediate future. In their review of otariid extinctions, Gerber and Hilborn (2001)  conclude that for species subject to El Niño impacts, ""the concern about  species recovery should focus on changes in frequency of El Niño  events.""<br/><br/>Infectious diseases occur commonly in pinnipeds and may have substantial impacts on their populations.&#160; Frequent direct contact between Sea Lions and domestic dogs in the settlements on San Cristobal, Santa Cruz and Isabela islands present a great danger of disease transmission. A viral outbreak (of canine distemper?) occurred in 2001 in which 569 dogs either died or were euthanized, and it was recommended that all dogs on the islands be vaccinated to reduce the risk of transmission to Sea Lions (Salazar <em>et al</em>. 2001). The identity of the virus has not been confirmed. The populations near settlements were shown to express higher immune activity than more isolated ones (Brock <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Plastic refuse drifting at sea and on shore is becoming an increasing problem, frequently entangling Sea Lions (Alava and Salazar 2006). Cargo ships running aground (like the ""Jessica"" in 2001) may lead to oil spills that could gravely affect pups onshore (in particular close to the harbours of San Cristobal and Puerto Ayora) and foraging adults.","Age-structure data are not available for the Galápagos Sea Lion population, so the generation time and the fraction mature cannot be calculated reliably. However, with sexual maturity attained at about six years of age and a maximum longevity of approximately 20 years, the average age of reproducing individuals should be around 10 years. It is likely that about two-thirds of all animals in the population are mature.<br/><br/>In 1978, Galápagos Sea Lions were estimated to number about 40,000 individuals (Trillmich 1979). This estimate was based on a nearly complete survey of the coastlines of all Galapagos Islands conducted by observers onshore and in boats nearshore. This resulted in an actual count of 9,093 individuals. The number counted was expanded to account for animals missed by observers on boats and to account for animals not onshore at the time of the counts. In November 2001, 7,942 Sea Lions were counted at haulouts and rookeries in the Galápagos Islands (Alava and Salazar 2006). By correcting for the probability that animals could be seen at a distance, total abundance was estimated to be 14-16,000. The corresponding number of mature individuals was likely about 26,400 in 1978 and 9,200-10,600 in 2001, which indicates a substantial reduction of about 60-65% in population size of the Galápagos Sea Lion. No further estimates of total population size have been made since 2001. Census data from a colony in the centre of the range (on the islet of Caamaño near Santa Cruz Island) covering the years from 2003 to 2013 showed no significant trend in total numbers of Sea Lions counted (mean ± SD; 244 ± 63) nor in the number of pups born (mean 103 ± 34.7), but substantial fluctuations around the mean. This variability suggests that single counts as represented by the 1978 and 2001 census may be misleading about trends in total Sea Lion numbers.<br/><br/>The available data suggest that the Galápagos Sea Lion population declined greatly between 1978 and 2001, and suggest that it has not recovered since then. If the number of adults in 2014 is still about 9,200-10,600 that would be a reduction of 60-65% in 36 years (3.6 generations). Assuming an exponential decline pattern between 1978 and 2001 (with an annual decline of 3.9%), and a relatively stable population from 2001-2014, this would still represent a reduction of &gt;50% (49-54%) over the last three generations (1984-2014). The causes of the reduction are partly understood, have not ceased, and may not be reversible.",Decreasing,"<p>Galápagos Sea Lions are found throughout the Galápagos Archipelago on all the major islands and on many smaller islands and rocks. A colony was established in 1986 at Isla de la Plata (coast of mainland Ecuador, 1°17' S, 81°04' W), just offshore from mainland Ecuador, but this site is not regularly used. Vagrants can be seen from the Ecuadorian coast north to Isla Gorgona in Colombia. There is also a record from Isla del Coco, Costa Rica, approximately 500 km southwest of Costa Rica. This record lacks genetic substantiation, so it cannot be decided whether the individual belonged to the Galápagos or the California species of Sea Lion.<br/><em></em></p>","The Galápagos Sea Lion population lives in the Galápagos Archipelago, which is an Ecuadorian National Park surrounded by a marine resources reserve.

Sua extensão de ocorrência calculada é de 15.116,4 km<sup>2</sup>. Baseando-se em modelos de detecção realizados no período entre 2008 e 2012, as subpopulações na Bahia, apresentaram uma redução maior que 30% em sua detectabilidade. Os especialistas inferem que&#160; a população também tenha tido uma taxa de redução equivalente, num intercalo de tempo de 10 anos (período maior que três gerações). Essa redução na população provavelmente está relacionada com o declínio continuado da qualidade do hábitat em decorrência do turismo desordenado, especulação imobiliária, incêndio, acúmulo de resíduos sólidos e agropecuária, sendo que essas ameaças não cessaram. Por essas razões, a espécie foi categorizada como Vulnerável (VU).","Heliotérmico, é restrito a áreas arenosas, com populações disjuntas ao longo da costa da Bahia e Sergipe, encontrada em sintopia com <em>Tropidurus hispidus</em> (Carvalho 2013). É diurno, com atividade constante ao longo do dia, encontrado em microhábitats com predominância de folhiço e arbustos (Vargens <em>et al</em>. 2008) e em clareiras (Martins <em>et al</em> 2010). A temperatura corpórea não foi influenciada pelo tamanho corpóreo nem pelo sexo. Sua tática de forrageio de espreita resulta em menor movimentação no hábitat (Vargens <em>et al</em>. 2008). Possui hábito terrestre com pico de atividade pela manhã (entre 6:00 e 9:00), sendo pouco frequente em horários mais quentes, avistado geralmente a uma temperatura média de 34,7 ºC e temperatura média do substrato de 30,16 ºC (Couto-Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2011). Encontrado em grande quantidade nas quatro fitofisionomias típicas de restinga (Mata de Restinga Vegetação Praial Vegetação arbustiva-arbórea em moitas com bromélias e Zonas Úmidas permanentes e temporárias), predominantemente em moita e praial. Possui uma dieta generalista, alimentando-se principalmente de formigas, besouros e cupins. Também fazem parte de sua dieta larvas, outros insetos (Ordens Demaptera Hemiptera Odonata Orthoptera), aracnídeos (Araneae Acari), Crustaceos (Isopoda) e Miriápodes (Chilopoda) (Travassos 2011). Atinge em média 34,3 mm de comprimento rostro-cloacal (Vargens <em>et al</em>. 2008). Considera-se que três gerações da espécie ocorra em menos de 10 anos.","Visto que é um lagarto de dunas e&#160; restinga, do bioma Mata Atlântica, os altos níveis de fragmentação e perturbações humanas (turismo desordenado especulação imobiliária incêndio acúmulo de resíduos sólidos e agropecuária) resultam em um decréscimo de área disponível, comprometendo a ocorrência da espécie (Martins 2010). Levando em consideração que a distribuição desta espécie limita-se ao ecossistema de restinga, que se encontra sob intensa degradação devido à crescente expansão imobiliária acredita-se que esta espécie esteja susceptível a perda de subpopulações (Tinôco <em>et al</em>. 2008).","Embora não haja informações ainda sobre suas populações, esta espécie é relativamente comum em áreas de restinga com mais de 3 mil registros no litoral norte da Bahia entre 2010 e 2013 (Centro de Ecologia e Conservação Animal-ECOA com. pess. 2013). Contudo, segundo Moacir Tinoco&#160; (comm. pes. 2013 a partir de estudo ainda não publicados), tomando por base modelos de deteccção realizados entre 2008 e 2012, observou-se que essas subpopulações apresentaram uma redução maior que 30% em sua detectabilidade (P=0.67 SE=011), indicando uma&#160; tendência populacional decrescente.

It is relatively common with a broad range endemic to the cold waters of the North Pacific. Trends in abundance have been stable in waters off the U.S. west coast where corresponding trends for mesoplodonts have been negative, possibly due to the effects of anthropogenic noise. Baird’s Beaked Whales are taken in Japan’s small-type whaling operations (annual quota around 60). One Baird’s Beaked Whale was reported as dying from entanglement in the large-mesh gillnet fishery off the western United States; bycatch of ziphiids (beaked whales ) in this fishery has been eliminated through pinger use. Given that this species is relatively common and is known to have persisted in stable numbers within a large portion of its range, it is considered Least Concern. However, it is likely that other subpopulations exist especially around Japan where they are still hunted (Kasuya 2017), and once they are better identified they could be assessed separately.</p>","<p>Though they may be seen close to shore where deep water approaches the coast, Baird's Beaked Whales' primary habitat is on or near the continental slope and near oceanic seamounts (Kasuya 2002) in temperate oceanic waters 1,000 to 3,000 m deep. Off the Pacific coast of Japan, these whales have been recorded in water temperatures ranging between 23°C and 29°C, with a southern limit at the 15°C isotherm at a depth of 100 m.</p><p>Baird's Beaked Whales feed mainly on deepwater and bottom-dwelling gadiform fishes and cephalopods &#160;(Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2002), as well as some pelagic fishes, such as mackerel, sardines, and saury. The diet off the Pacific coast of Japan consists of 82% fish and 18% cephalopods, while in the southern Sea of Okhotsk the proportions are 13% and 87%, respectively (Walker <em>et al. </em>2002).</p>","<p>Baird’s Beaked Whale is the only species of ziphiid to be commercially hunted (Kasuya and Ohsumi 1984, Kasuya 2017). Small numbers have been hunted by whalers from the Soviet Union, Canada and the United States mainly between 1930s to 1960s, whereas the hunting in Japan has been more consistent and substantial. The Japanese fishery started in the early 1600s and underwent several expansions and declines. At its peak, after World War II, over 300 whales were killed annually.&#160; Between 2005-2013 the quota for small-type whaling was 66/year (10 for the Sea of Japan [Hakodate], 4 for the southern Okhotsk Sea [Abashiri] and 52 for the Pacific coast [Wadaura, Ayukawa] Kasuya 2017).<br/> <br/> Incidental catches are reported infrequently. Some Baird's Beaked Whales have been caught in Japanese salmon driftnets (Ohsumi 1974). Artukhin <em>et al</em>. (2010) reported that beaked whales, most likely this species, were taken as bycatch in Japanese driftnet fishery in the Russian EEZ north of the Commander Islands and the southern part the Sea of Okhotsk. The estimated annual mortality rate in 1992-2008 was 4 (1-7) individuals. The fishery was closed in 2016. One Baird’s Beaked Whale was reported as dying from entanglement in the large-mesh gillnet fishery off the western United States;&#160; bycatch of ziphiids (beaked whales ) in this fishery has been eliminated through pinger use (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including <em>Ziphius cavirostris</em> and several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160; One mass stranding event involving Baird’s Beaked Whales is known from Japan and two from Mexico.&#160; Changes in the behavior of Baird’s Beaked Whales in response to simulated sonar have been observed (Stimpert&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; However, off the U.S. west coast where anthropogenic noise has been implicated in declines in mesoplodonts (Moore and Barlow 2013), there was no apparent decline in Baird’s Beaked Whales (Moore and Barlow 2017).&#160; </p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other beaked whales (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and such residues represent a potential health hazard. In Baird’s Beaked Whales, Subramanian <em>et al.&#160;</em>(1988) reported values for PCBs and DDE , which are low when compared to other toothed whales. Organochlorine and halogenated dimethylbipyrroles residues have been identified in Baird’s Beaked Whales (Prudente <em>et al. </em>1997, Haraguchi <em>et al. </em>2006) and various other species of mesoplodonts beaked whales&#160; (Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/> <br/> Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, given its cool-temperate to sub-Arctic habitat preference, although the nature of likely impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>","Three subpopulations of Baird’s Beaked Whales are recognized in the western North Pacific (Sea of Japan, Okhotsk Sea, and Pacific Ocean), where these whales have been exploited in the Pacific coast of Japan for centuries. However, nothing is known about population structure in the eastern and central North Pacific. &#160;Abundance in Japanese waters has been estimated at about 7,100 individuals (5,029 off the Pacific coast, 1,468 in the eastern Sea of Japan, and 663 in the southern Okhotsk Sea – Kasuya 2017). These are likely underestimates because the analysis methods did not account for whales missed due to their long dive times (Barlow 1999). A trend-based analysis of line-transect data from all surveys conducted off the U.S. west coast between 1991 and 2014 yielded an estimate of abundance of 2,697 (CV=0.60) whales (Moore and Barlow 2017) and an apparently stable trend. Barlow (2016) estimated Baird’s Beaked Whale abundance in the California Current at 5,394 (CV=0.83) and 7,960 (CV=0.93) whales for surveys conducted in 2008 and 2014, respectively. These estimates are higher than previously-published estimates for this region because they include lower estimates of trackline detection probability, g(0), based on Beaufort sea state-specific estimates of detectability for <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Barlow 2015).",Unknown,"<p>Baird's Beaked Whales are found in deep oceanic cold-temperate waters of the North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent&#160;Okhotsk and Bering Seas. Their range extends to the southern Gulf of California, Mexico, in the east and central Honshu, Japan, in the west. They also occur in the vicinity of drift ice in the northern Sea of Okhotsk. Off the Pacific coast of Japan, they migrate into waters over the continental slope from May to October, but where they go in winter is not known. They also occur in the northern Sea of Japan south to the Korean Peninsula. Their distributional limits in oceanic waters of the mid-Pacific are also not well known (Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2002).</p>",This species is hunted for food in Japan.,Marine,"<p>To date, the question of whether the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has the competence to classify or set catch limits for this species has not been formally resolved, even though Baird’s Beaked Whale is included in the IWC definition of ""bottlenose whale"".

50352086,4161,Cephalorhynchus heavisidii,Near Threatened,C1,2018,2017-09-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of Heaviside’s Dolphins is limited to the Benguela ecosystem (the shelf waters of the west coast of South Africa, Namibia, and southern Angola). Recent research indicates a relatively large population at the southern limit of the species range: estimated population size is 6,345 individuals (95% CI 3,573–11,267) along ~ 390 km of coastline from Table Bay to Lambert’s Bay (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009), with further unpublished research indicating similar population densities at two sites in Namibia (Elwen unpublished data). Thus, it can be inferred that there are certainly &gt;1,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The species does not appear to clearly meet any of the Red List Criteria for a threatened status. However, there is considerable uncertainty around both population structure and total population size and there is no information on trend. Several threats have been identified, including entanglement in a variety of inshore fishing gears (e.g., beach seines, purse seines, trawls, and gillnets). Additionally, competition with Hake (<em>Merluccius</em> spp.) fisheries may represent an indirect threat, as although Heaviside’s Dolphins remain largely inshore of the fishing activity, juvenile hake are significant prey. Potentially emerging threats include an experimental mid-water trawl fishery for Horse Mackerel (<em>Trachurus capensis</em>) operating off the west coast of South Africa and industrial development, notably marine phosphate mining on the Namibian shelf, and port and mining infrastructure expansion projects in both Walvis Bay and Lüderitz, two high-density areas for Heaviside’s Dolphins. As this species is limited by water temperature, climate change represents an additional emerging threat.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Guidelines state that “if LC, NT, and VU are considered to be equally plausible categories, the taxon may be categorized as NT.” In the absence of quantitative data from areas outside the Table Bay–Lambert’s Bay segment of coastline, the possibility that there are &lt;10,000 mature individuals cannot be ruled out, nor can a projected continuing decline of at least 10% over three generations given the known and emerging threats. Therefore, it is plausible that the species meets criterion C for VU but it is also plausible that number of mature individuals in unstudied parts of the range would push the total above 10,000. As a near-shore species with a very restricted range in a poorly studied region, Heaviside’s Dolphin is considered Near Threatened. This lends emphasis to the importance of quantifying mortality rates and improving estimates of abundance for the total species range.</p>","<p>Heaviside’s Dolphin is a coastal, shelf-dwelling species seen mainly in waters less than 100 m deep (Best and Abernethy 1994) throughout the cold, northward-flowing Benguela Current. More than 85% of sightings have been in water with surface temperatures of 9-15°C (Best and Abernethy 1994). Evidence from photo-identification (Elwen 2008, Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b) and satellite-linked tagging (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2014) indicated small home ranges between 50 and 80 km along shore, but with some animals also moving offshore to at least the 100 m isobath.<br/><br/>Throughout most of their range, Heaviside’s Dolphins show a strong diurnal <span class=""msoIns"">i<span class=""msoDel"">nshore-offshore movement pattern (Elwen <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2010) driven by resting and socializing inshore by day and nocturnal foraging in deep water on prey associated with the deep scattering layer. The dominant prey taken by Heaviside’s Dolphins are shallow-water species or life-stages, for example juvenile Hake (<em>Merluccius capensis</em>), Goby (<em>Sufflogobius bibartus</em>) and Horse Mackerel, as well as cephalopods, including octopus (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1992). Most fish eaten by Heaviside’s Dolphins are well below the modal length of commercially caught fish (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1992), and there is little spatial overlap in fishing effort and dolphin habitat (Fairweather <em>et al.</em> 2006).</span></p>","<p>In general, Heaviside’s Dolphins appear to face fewer threats than other members of its genus. Although fully protected legally, some killing with hand-thrown harpoons or guns was reported in the past (Rice and Saayman 1984, Best and Abernethy 1994). Heaviside’s Dolphins are susceptible to entanglement in inshore fishing gears such as beach seines, purse seines, trawls, and gillnets (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Bycatch in commercial fisheries appears to be low, although an experimental mid-water trawl fishery for Horse Mackerel operating off the South Africa west coast is of concern. Heaviside’s Dolphin bycatch must be monitored and the potential effects of the full-scale operation should be considered if there is evidence of significant mortality of dolphins in this fishery.<br/><br/>Information on organochlorine pollutant levels in a small sample of Heaviside’s Dolphins from the South African west coast indicated no significant exposure to DDT (De Kock <em>et al</em>. 1994). A more recent analysis of heavy metals in the skin of Heaviside’s Dolphins from South Africa and Namibia revealed that while levels were higher than expected for some metals, sampled individuals were deemed to be at low risk of lethal poisoning (Serot 2013). The scarcity of arable land, low rainfall and scarcity of rivers throughout the species range may help to limit pollutants entering the marine environment.<br/><br/>The impacts of marine mining, notably sediment dredging for phosphates, on the marine environment are not well understood but include direct destruction of the seabed and benthic fauna, release of hazardous material into the ocean, and reduced light penetration (Currie 2012). In addition, proposed onshore processing plants, at least in Namibia, are in or near known high use areas for the species at the ports of Walvis Bay and Lüderitz.<br/><br/>Due to the limited range of temperatures occupied by the animals within the Benguela Ecosystem (a cold-water system surrounded by warmer waters), Heaviside’s Dolphins have been identified as one of the cetacean species most at risk from large perturbations associated with global climate change (MacLeod 2009).<br/><br/>Low human population densities and the scarcity of large ports along most of the species’ range probably help reduce adverse effects from boat traffic at a population level, although high site fidelity of the species may result in localized impacts.</p>","<p>No range-wide survey has been conducted for Heaviside's Dolphins. However, abundance estimates from photographic mark-recapture studies are available at several locations in South Africa and Namibia. A three-year study between Cape Town and Lambert’s Bay, South Africa estimated 527 animals (95% confidence interval (CI) 272–1,020) using 20 km of coastline in western Saint Helena Bay over six weeks of survey effort; 3,429 animals (95% CI 1,721–6,828), using the 150 km of coastline around Saint Helena Bay, over three summer seasons; and 6,345 animals (95% CI 3,573–11,267) using the full ~390 km of coastline from Table Bay to Lambert’s Bay (estimated between two summer field seasons; Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b). Sighting rates within this latter area ranged from 0 to nearly 2 groups per km (mean group size = 4.5, for 10 km long sections of coastline; Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Estimates are also available from two high-use areas in Namibia (Walvis Bay: 508 animals, 95% CI 461–833, over eight weeks; and Lüderitz: 494 animals, 95% CI 403–607, 14 survey days within one year).<br/><br/>The species has exhibited high site fidelity over several years (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b) and this may affect population structure and limit gene flow between high-density sites. An assessment of genetic diversity and population genetic structure was conducted for this species using both mtDNA control region sequences and 13 microsatellite loci using 395 biopsy skin samples collected from free-ranging dolphins along the South African (Table Bay, Saint Helena Bay, Lambert’s Bay, Hondeklipbaai, and Port Nolloth) and Namibian (Lüderitz and Walvis Bay) coastlines. Both genetic markers rejected the hypothesis of one homogeneous population, but results were somewhat contrasting. MtDNA control region data indicated six genetically differentiated putative populations among the seven sampling sites, with Hondeklipbaai and Port Nolloth grouping as one subpopulation, whilst the microsatellite data provided a different, but not mutually exclusive, signal, clustering the dolphins into a northern population (comprised of Lambert’s Bay, Hondeklipbaai, Port Nolloth, Lüderitz Bay, and Walvis Bay) and a southern population that included the animals in Table Bay and St. Helena Bay (Gopal 2014). Overall, there appear to be two primary populations (northern and southern), but within each there is some limited structure suggesting that gene flow is not entirely open between sites. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution of the mitochondrial sequences indicated a departure from mutation-drift equilibrium due to a population expansion at the two extremes of the geographic range, but not towards the middle of the distribution. Small but significant genetic differentiation was indicated by the two markers (Gopal 2014). Whilst considerable progress was made towards understanding the population genetic structure of Heaviside's dolphins in this first study that covered a large geographic range, further genetic research, including information on relatedness, kin associations, and mating patterns, would improve understanding of population status and facilitate identification of management units for conservation.</p>",Unknown,"Heaviside’s Dolphins have a limited range, restricted to southwestern Africa (southern Angola to Cape Point, South Africa), with records from about 17°S to the southwestern tip of the continent. They are commonly seen along the west coast of South Africa in the Cape Town region (Rice 1998, Dawson 2002). Records extend along the entire west coast of South Africa and Namibia, and into southern Angola (Best 2007), with the exact northern limit of the species range poorly known, but possibly variable due to natural fluctuations in water temperature at the northern end of the Benguela ecosystem.","Some illegal hunting has been reported, but it is probably not at a significant level (Best and Abernethy 1994, Best 2007).

Clarifying language in the Red List Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2019) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” Although there is considerable uncertainty about numbers and trends, the global population numbers at least around 20,000. Therefore, the category of Critically Endangered is not plausible and the species should not be assigned to the DD category.<br/><br/>Northern Bottlenose Whales are much more visible than most other beaked whales, and they are fairly commonly observed in some parts of their range (Whitehead and Hooker 2012). The population was seriously depleted by commercial whaling and likely remains well below historical (pre-whaling) levels. However, the main decline of the total population of this species took place more than three generations ago (46.5 or 53.4 years, with a generation length of 15.5 [COSEWIC 2011] or 17.8 years [Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007]), although the declines in some specific areas such as Labrador (where whaling ended in 1971) occurred much more recently (late 1960s-early 1970s). Total population size is probably in the low tens of thousands although survey coverage of the range is far from complete, and there are potentially significant and largely unresolved biases (both positive and negative) in converting survey data into population estimates (Whitehead and Hooker 2012).<br/><br/>Current and projected threats that could cause declines include high levels of anthropogenic sound, especially from military mid-frequency sonar and seismic surveys, and bycatch in fisheries. The pervasiveness and severity of these threats varies across the range. Listing as Near Threatened is plausible given the historical depletion in combination with ongoing exposure to underwater sound and the risk of bycatch in parts of the species’ range. Although the species’ widespread occurrence and the relatively large total number of individuals across the range mean that Least Concern is also plausible, the history of depletion, the uncertainty surrounding abundance estimates, and the evidence that these whales are exposed in much of their range to harmful anthropogenic sound and bycatch risk, taken together, argue for a precautionary approach and a listing as Near Threatened. Near Threatened is selected               because the               species is close to meeting criterion C1               for Vulnerable, as there may be fewer than 10,000 mature               individuals and, given the threats from               bycatch, plastics and anthropogenic noise, a continuing               decline of 10% over               three generations is plausible.<br/><br/>Two ‘designatable units’ are listed under Canada’s Species At Risk Act - the Scotian Shelf population as Endangered and the Davis Strait-Baffin Bay-Labrador Sea population as Special Concern (COSEWIC 2011). The Scotian Shelf population (often referred to as The Gully population) may warrant a separate subpopulation assessment for the Red List, as may other subpopulations of the species as population structure becomes better known.</p>","<p>These cold temperate to subarctic whales are found in deep waters (generally at least 500 m deep), mostly seaward of the continental shelf and often near submarine canyons. They sometimes travel several kilometers into broken ice fields, but are more common in open water. Few whales were caught in shallow waters over the continental shelf off Labrador and in waters less than 1,000 m deep off the west coast of Norway.</p><p>The species occupies a very narrow niche: its primary food source is squid of the genus <em>Gonatus</em> (Hooker <em>et al</em>. 2001, Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 2003). The whales may also occasionally eat fish (such as herring and redfish), sea cucumbers, starfish, and prawns. They do much of their feeding on or near the bottom in very deep water (&gt;800 m, and as deep as 1,400 m; Hooker and Baird 1999). Fernández <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported that the stomachs of three individuals had remains of warm-temperate cephalopods (e.g. <em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>, <em>Heteroteuthis</em> sp.).</p>","<p>This is one of only two species of beaked whales that were hunted commercially on a large scale. Somewhat more than 800 Northern Bottlenose Whales were reportedly taken in the Faroe Islands during the period 1584–1993 (Bloch <em>et al</em>. 1996). Hunting by whalers from Great Britain, Norway, and Canada from the 1850s to the early 1970s resulted in more than 65,000 whales landed (with many more struck but lost; Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1993). Mitchell (1977) considered that the population was severely depleted by whaling in both the early (steam-powered) and modern (petroleum-powered) whaling periods. The species has essentially been unexploited for almost 50 years (i.e. since the Norwegian pelagic hunt ended in 1973), with only a few animals taken in some years in the Faroe Islands (on average 2.2 whales per year reported in the period 1709–2002). The aggregate population was certainly reduced by whaling, and the extent of recovery is uncertain (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Recovery rate and general resilience to threats is affected by this species’ slow reproductive rate (Feyrer <em>et al.</em> 2020). A significant decline in genetic diversity has been detected in the Scotian Shelf population which corresponds to the timing of whaling (Feyrer <em>et al.</em> 2019). Low genetic diversity and inbreeding may be having an impact on the recovery of this very small, genetically distinct unit.</p>  <p>Northern Bottlenose Whales reportedly interact with trawl and longline fisheries in a number of areas—off Iceland (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2009), on the Scotian Shelf, and off Newfoundland (Oyarbide Cuervas-Mons 2008, Marotte 2017). They interact with fisheries for Greenland halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>) in Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea (COSEWIC 2011). Small numbers of entanglements have been reported, but reporting is far from complete (Whitehead and Hooker 2012). Given the very low observer effort and the low likelihood that fatally entangled whales would wash ashore or otherwise be seen or reported, any records are a concern. Unpublished data (L. J. Feyrer, unpubl. data) from the Scotian Shelf photo-identification catalogue indicated that 4–5% of the identified individuals bear entanglement or propeller scars. Entanglement in fisheries may be an important source of mortality for this species.<br/><br/>Miller <em>et al</em>. (2015) considered Northern Bottlenose Whales to be highly sensitive to acoustic disturbance and therefore at risk from marine industrialization and naval activity (mid-frequency sonar). In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic surveys, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em>. 2019). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em>. 2019). Off the U.S. west coast anthropogenic noise has been implicated in declines in mesoplodonts (Moore and Barlow 2013). The effects of seismic surveys has been a particular concern for Northern Bottlenose Whales (DFO 2009) and, partially to protect the Northern Bottlenose Whale, the Gully was declared a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2004 and no such activities are permitted inside its boundary (although seismic surveys outside the MPA boundary would certainly ensonify waters within that boundary). The habitat of Northern Bottlenose Whales off the eastern and northeastern edges of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has been exposed to a particularly high density of seismic surveys (Gomez <em>et al</em>. 2017, Marotte 2017). Grove&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2020) reported a series of sightings and strandings of these whales along the northern coast of Iceland between July and October 2018, a year in which around 100 beaked whales were documented as having died across the Northeast Atlantic. Those authors also noted the temporal coincidence between the first sightings of Northern Bottlenose Whales in Skjálfandi Bay (Iceland) and the start of a NATO&#160;anti-submarine&#160;warfare exercise in the Norwegian Sea (immediately east of Iceland).<br/><br/>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of cetacean mortality, especially of beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm: Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other ziphiids (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and they represent a potential hazard to the health of Bottlenose Whales. Overall levels in Northern Bottlenose Whales in the western Atlantic were comparable to those reported for other North Atlantic odontocetes (Hooker <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; However, contaminant levels in The Gully population of Bottlenose Whales increased dramatically between 1996 and 2003; although the source of this increase is unknown, it may have been related to the onset of drilling for gas nearby (Hooker <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>An overall decline in available habitat for Northern Bottlenose Whales was predicted by MacLeod (2009) as a result of warmer waters due to global climate change (also see Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>","<p>Abundance of the Scotian Shelf population was estimated at 143 (95% confidence interval 129–156) and approximately stable between 1988-2011 using photo-identification mark-recapture methods (O’Brien and Whitehead 2013). New analyses adding data up until 2019 suggest a slight decline in abundance between 1988 and roughly 2004 (when The Gully was made a Marine Protected Area) with a slight increase thereafter (L.J. Feyrer and H. Whitehead, Dalhousie University, unpubl. data). A minimum estimate of abundance on the northeastern edge of the Grand Banks was 128, based upon a lack of photo identification matches between surveys in 2016 and 2017 (Stewart 2018). There are no published abundance estimates for other areas of the western North Atlantic. Over 65,000 Northern Bottlenose Whales were killed in a multinational hunt that operated in the North Atlantic from <em>ca</em> 1850 to the early 1970s (Mitchell 1977, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1993). Christensen and Ugland (1983) estimated the initial (pre-whaling) population size as about 90,000 whales, reduced to some 30,000 by 1914. In 1995, the Scientific Committee of the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) modelled population trajectories for the northeastern Atlantic, using recorded catch data, assumptions about the population biology of the species, and recent population estimates. The results were highly varied, suggesting an initial population of between about 35,000 and 110,000, and population status in the 1990s was inferred to have ranged from fully recovered to still severely depleted (NAMMCO 1995).<br/><br/>It is challenging to estimate abundance for populations of Northern Bottlenose Whales, except where a substantial proportion of the population has been photo-identified (currently true only for the Scotian Shelf). Due to their deep dives, they are rarely sighted during aerial surveys (e.g. Lawson and Gosselin 2009). Their deep and prolonged diving also adds a substantial negative bias to shipboard visual surveys, but one that can be corrected for. However, Bottlenose Whales are also well known for approaching ships, a tendency that introduces a positive bias in abundance estimates from shipboard surveys that is much harder to correct for (Whitehead and Hooker 2012).<br/><br/>There is no estimate of current global abundance. A very rough and outdated estimate for the entire eastern North Atlantic is 40,000 (NAMMCO&#160; 1995). The Iceland (and Faroes) population was estimated at 28,000 (CV = 0.22) from shipboard surveys in 1995 and 2001 (Pike <em>et al.</em> 2003). The population in the waters off the Faeroes and Western Europe was estimated at 19,539 (CV = 0.36) based upon 15 sightings from ships in 2005 and 2007 (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2017). Thirty-six ship-based sightings off Iceland and the Faroes in 2015 resulted in an estimate of 18,375 (CV = 0.59) (NAMMCO 2019). There are no statistically valid abundance estimates for the Andenes, Møre, and Svalbard areas. Therefore, the current North Atlantic population is likely on the order of at least 20,000 whales.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Northern Bottlenose Whales are found only in the deep waters (usually &gt;500 m deep) of the North Atlantic. In the west, they occur from New England, USA to Davis Strait and southern Baffin Bay, between Baffin Island and Greenland; in the east, from the Strait of Gibraltar to Svalbard (<em>ca</em>. 38ºN to 72ºN: Mead 1989, Moors-Murphy 2018). Their northern pelagic distribution extends to the margins of pack ice. The Gully on the Scotian Shelf southeast of Nova Scotia, Canada (<em>ca</em>. 44ºN, 59ºW) is the southernmost area of consistent Northern Bottlenose Whale presence in the western Atlantic (Wimmer and Whitehead 2004). In the eastern North Atlantic, the southernmost area of consistent presence is around the Azores (<em>ca</em>. 39°N: Steiner <em>et al</em>. 1998, Weilermann <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, the southern limits of their known range are Virginia (<em>ca</em>. 36°N), USA, in the west (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015), and the Canary Islands in the east (29ºN, Vonk and Martin-Martel 1989). Though there are a few reports from the Mediterranean Sea (Cañadas and Sagarminaga 2000), the North Sea (Mead 1989) and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Mitchell and Kozicki 1975), these whales are not seen regularly in enclosed seas (Moors-Murphy 2018).</p>  <p>Historical catch statistics were interpreted as indicating at least six centers of abundance, each potentially representing a separate stock (Benjaminsen 1972, Whitehead and Hooker 2012): i) The Gully, ii) northern Labrador Sea-Davis Strait; (iii) East Greenland, Iceland, Jan Mayen and Faeroe Islands; iv) Andenes, Norway; v) Møre, Norway; and vi) Svalbard. Anecdotal reports from whalers suggest a north-south seasonal migration in some regions of the eastern Atlantic but there is no solid evidence for this. Bottlenose Whales are present in The Gully year-round (Whitehead and Hooker 2012). They inhabit the most northerly waters of the Barents and Greenland seas in summer (May to August) and are present in Baffin Bay in at least the summer and autumn.</p>  <p>The best-known population is centred in several large submarine canyons, most notably The Gully, on the edge of the Scotian Shelf southeast of Nova Scotia, Canada (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1993, Wimmer and Whitehead 2004, COSEWIC 2011). This population is largely isolated from others to the north (Newfoundland, Labrador) and northeast (northern Iceland) as shown by genomic and photoidentification data (Feyrer <em>et al</em>. 2019; Stewart 2018).</p>","<p>This species was heavily exploited in the past for multiple purposes, but there is now only a very small-scale hunt in the Faroes.</p>",Marine,"<p>The species is included in Appendix I of CITES.

Several Southern Bottlenose Whales have been recorded as bycatch of large-scale driftnet fishing in the Tasman Sea, but numbers taken annually are not known (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Although past levels of bycatch are unknown, they are likely to be low now due to adoption in 1989 of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly, which called for effective conservation and management measures of living marine resources in areas of high seas drift-netting.

Kasamatsu and Joyce (1995) reported high encounter rates of beaked whales, likely mostly Southern Bottlenose Whales, at 58°S to 62°S in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Encounter rates were lower in the western and central South Pacific. At least in summer, they occur mostly in Antarctic waters south of the Antarctic Convergence; the southernmost sighting reported by Kasamatsu and Joyce (1995) was at 73°S in the Ross Sea.

50358334,11047,Kogia breviceps,Least Concern,,2020,2019-10-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Pygmy Sperm Whale is distributed in deep oceanic waters of the tropical and temperate Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from approximately 50°S to 50-60°N. Despite the expansion of cetacean research in oceanic waters, there is still very limited information on the distribution, abundance, behaviour or population structure of Pygmy Sperm Whales globally. This is largely due to the short surfacing interval, cryptic surface behavior and long, deep dives which make these whales extremely challenging to observe at sea. There is no information on global abundance or trends but numerous stranding records and high detection rates during acoustic surveys indicate that this species is not as uncommon as visual surveys would suggest. Unlike some beaked whales, Pygmy Sperm Whales do not seem to experience significant impacts from exposure to anthropogenic noise, and they also do not appear to be bycaught frequently in fishing gear. However, because they are so rarely observed, declines would be difficult to detect and therefore a 30% global reduction over three generations (36 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out.&#160; </p>  <p>The Pygmy Sperm Whale was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008 and it remains extremely data-poor. The Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) state that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD”. In this instance the number of sightings and strandings and the wide pan-tropical distribution preclude the species being classified as Critically Endangered and DD therefore cannot be applied. The Pygmy Sperm Whale is therefore classified as Least Concern on the assumption that it is widely distributed and there are areas of known concentration, no major threats are known to occur across the majority of its range and it is likely to be more common than would be suggested from sighting surveys (due to its cryptic behavior).</p>","<p>At-sea observations of Pygmy Sperm Whales are rare, and therefore their habitat preferences remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is established that they occur over continental and insular slope waters, as well as in deep oceanic waters. Off the main Hawaiian Islands, small-boat dedicated surveys conducted from 2000 to 2012 showed that Pygmy Sperm Whales occur mostly in waters deeper than 2000 m (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2013). Elsewhere, sightings are often aggregated with those of Dwarf Sperm Whales, which makes a detailed assessment of their habitat preferences challenging (e.g. Mullin <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Gulf of Mexico, Baumgartner <em>et al</em>. (2001) recorded sightings most frequently in water depths between 400 and 1,000 m, with some sightings extending into much deeper waters (up to 3,500 m). </p>  <p>A number of studies have described the diet and feeding ecology of Pygmy Sperm Whales around the globe. Their diet consists primarily of oceanic cephalopods, but includes fish, shrimp and swimming crabs (Ross 1979, Beatson 2007, Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Small mesopelagic squid (particularly Histiothidae and Cranchiidae) contribute significantly to the diet of Pygmy Sperm Whales (Beatson 2007, Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Cephalopods are the primary prey of Pygmy Sperm Whales in Hawaiian waters judging by the fact that they comprised 78.7% of prey abundance and 93.4% of the biomass in stomachs of stranded specimens, with 38 species from 17 different families represented (West <em>et al</em>. 2009). Morphological adaptations such as their “false gills” and ability to squirt ink suggest that the evolution of <em>Kogia</em> spp. was shaped in part by high predation pressure, particularly from sharks and killer whales (Plön 2004). </p>","<p>Small numbers of Pygmy Sperm Whales have been taken in coastal whaling operations off Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Lesser Antilles, and Sri Lanka (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, the extent of takes is extremely small. They have also been caught incidentally in drift gillnet fisheries in Sri Lanka, Thailand, California and in the north-east Atlantic (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>1993, Barlow <em>et al. </em>1997, Perez <em>et al. </em>2001). In 2005, a large series of unusual stranding events over about 3 weeks in and around Taiwan included several <em>Kogia</em>&#160;(Wang and Yang 2006, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008), with at least two of them Pygmy Sperm Whales (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is unknown if military, seismic or other loud noise-producing human activities were implicated in these strandings. Pygmy sperm whales are known to have died from plastic ingestion (Tarpley &amp; Marwitz 1993). The neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) was detected in urine and fecal samples recovered from 24 of 41 Pygmy Sperm Whales stranded along the U.S. Atlantic coast from 1997 to 2008, suggesting that exposure to these toxins from harmful algal blooms should be a concern (Fire <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of global Pygmy Sperm Whale abundance. Estimates of local or regional abundance are few, particularly because of the cryptic nature of this species as well as the difficulty of distinguishing <em>K. breviceps</em> from <em>K. sima </em>at sea. Abundance estimation is challenging because these whales dive for long periods and are inconspicuous when they surface. Therefore, visual surveys have a very low probability of detection (at or well below approximately 35%) (Barlow 1999; Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p>  <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, the most recent abundance estimates for Pygmy and Dwarf Sperm Whales combined is 186 (CV=1.04) from a summer survey conducted in 2009 and covering the waters from the 200m isobath to the seaward extent of the US EEZ (Garrison 2016). Earlier estimates in the Gulf of Mexico that again combined both <em>Kogia</em> species were from 1991-1994 (547, CV=0.28), 1996-2001 (742, CV=0.29) and 2003-2004 (453, CV=1.04) generated from surveys all conducted between April and August (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Mullin 2007). In the western North Atlantic, the best abundance estimate is 3,785 individuals (CV=0.47) from a summer survey conducted in 2011 from the waters of central Florida to the lower Bay of Fundy (Palka 2012, Garrison 2016). The two&#160;<em>Kogia</em>&#160;species strand frequently on beaches of the southeastern United States. For example, between 1978 and 1987, Odell (1991) documented that <em>Kogia</em> spp. was the second most frequently stranded cetacean taxon, after the common bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>), from North Carolina to Texas. From 2007–2015, 17 strandings of <em>Kogia</em> spp. were documented in Virginia, 81 in North Carolina, and 112 on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). The large number of strandings in these states suggests that <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. are a common component of the US Atlantic cetacean fauna, despite the fact that these species are seldom detected during visual surveys in these waters (Garrison <em>et al</em>. 2010). This was confirmed by a recent study that compared the detections of <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. between visual survey and passive acoustic methods along the U.S. Atlantic coast, concluding that <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. are indeed relatively common in shelf break and slope waters of the western North Atlantic between Virginia and Florida, and that they are not readily available to visual surveys in this region (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>The latest abundance estimate from the Hawaiian EEZ is 7,138 (CV=1.12) from a 2002 shipboard survey (Barlow 2006). A 2010 survey throughout the Hawaiian EEZ did not result in any <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. sightings (Bradford <em>et al. </em>2013). In Hawaiian waters, the Pygmy Sperm Whale is the second most frequently recorded stranded cetacean species, with 35 strandings documented between 1963 and 2008 (Shallenberger 1981, Nitta 1987, Maldini<em> et al</em>. 2005) again suggesting they are relatively common but rarely sighted in the region. Off the west coast of the US (Washington, Oregon and California), the best estimate of Pygmy Sperm Whale abundance is 4,111 (CV=1.12) based on shipboard line-transect surveys in 2008 and 2014 (Barlow 2016). In the southwestern Indian Ocean, aerial survey data resulted in an abundance of 683 (both species of <em>Kogia</em> aggregated) in the Mozambique Channel, the Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands (Laran <em>et al</em>. 2017).

The southern distribution includes New Zealand, Tasmania and South Africa, and the northern distributional limits extend to Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. They are mostly observed over shelf breaks and in insular slope waters (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2015, McAlpine 2018). Pygmy Sperm Whales are rarely recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea or shallower waters of SE Asia (McAlpine 2018, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). The range of <em>Kogia breviceps</em> is still poorly understood, though a lack of live sighting records may be due more to their inconspicuous behaviour than to rarity. Stranding records suggest that the species is locally common in some areas such as off South Africa or the southeastern USA (Plön 2004, Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Pygmy Sperm Whale has not been recorded in West Africa, but this may be due to the lack of surveys in that region (Weir 2010).</p>","<p>Pygmy Sperm Whales are hunted on a small scale in a few places (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>1993, 2015).</p>",Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

50359330,11048,Kogia sima,Least Concern,,2020,2020-02-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Dwarf Sperm Whale is an oceanic species that occurs in the tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Although these whales are frequently encountered in several regions, including Hawaii and the Bahamas, there is limited information on their numbers, population structure and ecology. This can be attributed to their cryptic nature which makes them extremely challenging to observe and study. There is no information on global abundance or trends, but numerous stranding records and high detection rates during acoustic surveys in some areas indicate that Dwarf Sperm Whales are not as uncommon as visual surveys would suggest. Because they are so rarely observed and identified, declines would be difficult to detect.</p>  <p>The Dwarf Sperm Whale was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008 and it remains data-poor. The Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) state that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD”. In this instance the number of sightings and strandings and the wide pan-tropical distribution precludes the species being classified as Critically Endangered and rules out a DD classification on the basis of that ‘criterion’. The Dwarf Sperm Whale is classified as Least Concern on the understanding that it is widely distributed, while there are no areas of known concentration, no major threats are known to occur across the majority of its range, and it is likely to be more common than is suggested from the results of sighting surveys (due to its cryptic behaviour).</p>","<p></p><p>Dwarf Sperm Whales occur over continental and insular slope waters, as well as in deep oceanic waters. Off the main Hawaiian Islands, the Dwarf Sperm Whale is the sixth most commonly observed species and it is most frequently sighted in waters 500-1,000m deep (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2013). Around Great Abaco in the Bahamas, Dwarf Sperm Whales are common in slope and deep oceanic waters, with some seasonal movement between the two (Dunphy-Daly <em>et al</em>. 2008). Elsewhere, sightings of Dwarf Sperm Whales are often combined with those of Pygmy Sperm Whales, which makes a detailed assessment of their respective habitat preferences challenging (Mullin <em>et al</em>. 2004). Relatively few studies have described the diet of Dwarf Sperm Whales. However, the available information suggests that they are primarily teuthophagous. Along the US Atlantic coast, Dwarf Sperm Whales primarily consume small squids of the families Histioteuthidae, Cranchiidae and Ommastrephidae (mean mantle length = 7.8 cm; Staudinger <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the SW Atlantic Ocean, stomach content data from Brazil suggest that at least 10 families of cephalopods are consumed (Dos Santos and Haimovici 2001, Moura <em>et al</em>. 2016). &#160;About 38 different prey species are known from South Africa (Ross 1979; Plön 2004).</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>Small numbers of Dwarf Sperm Whales have been taken deliberately in opportunistic hunting off Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Lesser Antilles, and Sri Lanka (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, the scale of such removals is thought to be very small. These whales also die incidentally in drift gillnet fisheries in the northern Indian Ocean and in pelagic longline fisheries in the north-eastern Atlantic (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>1993, Arbelo <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). In 2005, a large series of unusual stranding events over a period of about 3 weeks in and around Taiwan included 13 Dwarf Sperm Whales (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is unknown if military, seismic survey or other loud noise-producing human activities were implicated in these strandings. Exposure to domoic acid associated with harmful algal blooms was implicated in Dwarf Sperm Whale mortality in the south-eastern US (Fire <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; As with most other cetaceans, there is growing evidence that Kogia species have a propensity to swallow plastic debris (Stamper <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160; </p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>There is limited information on the abundance of Dwarf Sperm Whales. Estimates of local or regional abundance are few, particularly because of the cryptic nature of this species as well as the difficulty of distinguishing <em>K. breviceps</em> from <em>K. sima </em>at sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, minimal (uncorrected) abundance estimates generated from vessel-based surveys conducted between April and August refer to both species, combined. Estimates include 547 individuals (CV=0.28) in 1991-1994, 742 individuals (CV=0.29) in 1996-2001 and 453 individuals (CV=1.04) in 2003-2004 (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Mullin 2007). The most recent uncorrected abundance estimate, again for both species combined, is 186 (CV=1.04) from a summer vessel-based survey in 2009 covering the waters from the 200m isobath to the seaward extent of the US EEZ (Garrison 2016). In the western North Atlantic, the most recent abundance estimate is 1,042 Dwarf Sperm Whales (CV=0.65) from a combination of vessel and aerial surveys conducted in July–August 2011 in offshore waters from North Carolina to the lower Bay of Fundy (Palka 2012). <em>Kogia</em> spp. strand frequently on beaches of the south-eastern United States. Between 1978 and 1987, Odell (1991) documented that the genus <em>Kogia</em> was the second most frequently stranded cetacean taxon between North Carolina and Texas, after the common bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>). From 2007–2015, 17 strandings of <em>Kogia</em> spp. were documented in Virginia, 81 in North Carolina, and 112 on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). The large number of strandings in these states suggests that <em>Kogia</em> are common off the US Atlantic coast, despite the fact that they are very seldom detected during visual surveys in these waters (Garrison <em>et al</em>. 2010). This was confirmed by a recent study that compared the detections of <em>Kogia</em> between visual survey and passive acoustic methods along the U.S. Atlantic coast, concluding that <em>Kogia</em> are indeed relatively common in shelf break and slope waters of the western North Atlantic between Virginia and Florida, and that they are not readily available to visual surveys in this region (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>The latest abundance estimate from the Hawaiian EEZ is 7,138 (CV=1.12) from a 2002 shipboard survey (Barlow 2006). A 2010 survey throughout the Hawaiian EEZ did not result in any <em>Kogia</em> sightings (Bradford <em>et al. </em>2013). In the southwestern Indian Ocean, aerial survey data corrected for availability bias resulted in an abundance estimate of 683 (both species of <em>Kogia</em> combined) in the Mozambique Channel, the Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands (Laran <em>et al</em>. 2017). Florida (USA) and South Africa have the highest reported stranding rates in the world of both Pygmy and Dwarf Sperm Whales, which suggests that <em>Kogia </em>spp. are relatively common in these regions (Credle 1988, Plön 2004).</p><br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Although the range of Dwarf Sperm Whales is poorly understood, they occur in oceanic waters of the warm temperate and tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from approximately 45°S to 45°N. The paucity of live sighting records is due at least partly to their inconspicuous behaviour rather than rarity. Dwarf Sperm Whales seem to be more abundant in tropical and subtropical waters. They occur in slightly warmer waters than Pygmy Sperm Whales (<em>Kogia breviceps </em>Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2015, McAlpine 2018). There is only one record of a Dwarf Sperm Whale in the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered extralimital. The northern-most record is from the Faroe Islands (Bloch and Mikkelsen 2009) and the presumed southern range limits include South Africa (Plön 2004) and Southern Australia (Jefferson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). These whales are not known to migrate, but strandings in some regions are seasonal, which might indicate seasonal shifts in distribution. For example, in the north-eastern Atlantic, strandings occur mainly in autumn and winter (MacAlpine 2018). Dwarf Sperm Whales are most often observed over shelf breaks and in insular slope waters (McAlpine 2018). They are observed relatively frequently around certain oceanic islands such as the main Hawai’ian Islands (Baird <em>et al. </em>2013), Great Abaco in the Bahamas (Dunphy-Daly <em>et al. </em>2008), and Indian Ocean islands such as Mayotte, in the Mozambique Channel, around the Seychelles and in Pemba Channel, Tanzania (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010, Laran <em>et al. </em>2017, Braulik <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><br/><p></p>",<p>Dwarf Sperm Whales are hunted on rare occasions at a small scale in a few places (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>,Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Along the continental slope of  North America, they seem to associate with high sea-floor relief along  the continental shelf (Palka <em>et al.</em> 1997, Stenson <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>These  dolphins often associate and feed with large baleen whales (Fin and  Humpback whales) and are known to form mixed-species groups with Pilot  Whales and certain other dolphin species (including Common Bottlenose  and White-beaked Dolphins). Atlantic White-sided Dolphins feed mostly on  small pelagic schooling fish (such as herring, mackerel, cod, smelt,  hake, and sandlance), shrimp, and squid (Cipriano 2018, Hernandez-Millan  <em>et al.</em> 2010).","Hunting:<br/>Some hunting of these dolphins occurred in the past in Norway, Greenland, eastern Canada and the Faroe Islands (Jefferson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993, Reeves <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  1999). They are still taken at least opportunistically in Canada (parts  of Newfoundland and Labrador), Greenland and the Faroe Islands.  Reported catches in the Faroe Islands were 333 and 310 in 2004 and 2005,  respectively (NAMMCO 2005). A review of Faroese drive hunts showed that  since 1872, about 9,435 Atlantic White-sided Dolphins were taken in 158  drives, an annual average of 68.4 individuals (range 0-774) (Bloch and  Mikkelsen 2017).<br/><br/>Reported catches of White-beaked and Atlantic  White-sided Dolphins, combined, in Greenland between 2006 and 2011  totaled 802 (Piniarneq 2014). The hunting is opportunistic, with numbers  taken each year ranging from 39 in 2007 to 261 in 2010. The average  catch of dolphins between 2011 and 2015 was 160 per year, an increase  over the previous 5 years (2006-2010) when the average was 115 per year  (NAMMCO 2016). It is not known whether this is due to an increase in the  dolphin population around Greenland or hunters are targeting dolphins  to a greater extent.<br/><br/>Bycatch:<br/>Incidental mortality in fishing  gear has been documented off Canada, the United States, the United  Kingdom and Ireland and likely occurs in most of the range of the  species. Gaskin (1992) judged Atlantic White-sided Dolphins to be less  vulnerable to capture in pelagic near-surface drift nets and fixed  groundfish gillnets than are many other small cetaceans. They may,  however, be especially susceptible to capture in midwater trawl nets  (Addink <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Maine,  it was estimated for the period 1990 to 1995 that around 120 Atlantic  White-sided Dolphins were caught each year in the groundfish gillnet  fishery, and an average of 58 dolphins per year in the groundfish trawl  fishery (Palka <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). Morizur <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  (1999) investigated marine mammal bycatch in 11 pelagic trawl fisheries  operated by four different countries in the Northeast Atlantic and  Atlantic White-sided Dolphins were one of the main species identified in  the reports. Mean dolphin catch rate for all fisheries combined was one  dolphin per 20.7 tows, or one dolphin per 98 h of towing. All dolphin  by-catches occurred during the night and Atlantic White-sided Dolphins  were observed feeding around the net during towing, this behaviour may  make them more vulnerable to capture. Total annual estimated average  fishery-related mortality or serious injury in the NW Atlantic stock of  White-sided Dolphins (mainly in US and south-eastern Canadian waters)  during 2012–2016 was 30 (CV=0.19), with some mortality occurring in the  northeast sink gillnet fishery and the mid-Atlantic bottom trawl fishery  but the largest numbers taken in the northeast bottom trawl fishery  (Hayes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2018).<br/><br/>Historical bycatch data  in the Northwest Atlantic obtained from a Canadian experimental salmon  driftnet fishery between 1965 and 2001 indicated that four species of  small cetacean were caught incidentally. Harbor Porpoises were the most  frequently caught species in all areas except the Labrador Sea, where  Atlantic White-sided Dolphins were the most frequent (Stenson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Substantial  numbers of Atlantic White-side Dolphins have been by-caught in trawl  fisheries south-west of Ireland (Couperus 1997a,b; Reeves <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999).<br/><br/>Other Threats:<br/>Like  other North Atlantic marine mammals, Atlantic White-sided Dolphins are  contaminated by organochlorines, other anthropogenic compounds and heavy  metals (Reeves <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999) and, like most marine  mammals they are likely to ingest plastic debris and this could have  detrimental effects on health (Panti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2019).  Shifts in distribution related to climate change presumably have  occurred and are occurring but little is known about how these might  affect Atlantic White-sided Dolphin populations (MacLeod <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Mass  strandings of Atlantic White-sided Dolphins occur relatively  frequently. In fact, mass stranding was the cause of death for nearly  70% of the documented deaths (46/67) of Atlantic White-sided Dolphin on  Cape Cod, USA (Bogomolni <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).","This species is quite abundant throughout its range. There is no  credible estimate of total abundance but various estimates exist for  some parts of the range.<br/><br/>The number of Atlantic White-sided  Dolphins in the western North Atlantic, from the southern Gulf of Maine  north-eastward to Cabot Strait, was estimated as about 27,000  individuals in July - September 1995 (Palka <em>et al.</em> 1997) and  aerial line transect surveys of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1995  produced an estimate of 11,740 (CV = 47%) (Kingsley and Reeves 1998).  Aerial line transect surveys of Georges Bank to the Gulf of St. Lawrence  in July and August 1999 resulted in an estimate of 51,640 (CV=38%)  (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2006). The most recent estimate for the western  Atlantic is 48,819 (CV=0.61) based on shipboard and aerial surveys  during June–August 2011 covering waters north of New Jersey from the  coastline to the 100-m depth contour, throughout the Gulf of Maine and  including the lower Bay of Fundy (Palka 2012, Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2018). A total  of 640 cetacean stranding events involving 19 species and 881  individuals were recorded for the Canadian Maritimes provinces from  1990–2008 and the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin was the most frequently  stranded species, representing 23% of all individuals (Nemiroff <em>et al.</em> 2010). <br/><br/>In  the central North Atlantic, aerial surveys of Icelandic and adjacent  waters in 1987 yielded an estimate of 37,622 Atlantic White-sided  Dolphins (no variance given) (Sigurjónsson and Vikingsson 1997). About  96,000 (CV=54%) were present off the west coast of Scotland in 1998  (MacLeod 2004). Aerial and vessel-based surveys of cetaceans in waters  of the European Union in 2016 produced an estimate of 15,510 (CV=0.717),  most of them in the northern parts of the study area around Scotland  and Norway (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>There may be  150,000–300,000 Atlantic White-sided Dolphins in the entire North  Atlantic (Kaschner 2004), with little published evidence of population  structure (Mikkelsen and Lund 1994).",Unknown,"Atlantic White-sided Dolphins are found in cold temperate to subpolar  waters of the North Atlantic, from about 38°N (south of Cape Cod) in the  west and the Brittany coast of France in the east, north to southern  Greenland, Iceland, the Faroes and southern Svalbard (Reeves <em>et al.</em>  1999, Cipriano 2018).

In the previous assessment (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008), the Baiji was evaluated as Critically Endangered (CR) (Possibly Extinct), as abundance was believed to be extremely low, and as the numerous serious threats it faced in the wild were still occurring. The last confirmed sighting of a Baiji was in 2002. Although the species is generally believed to be extinct (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007) sporadic unconfirmed reports of sightings mean that the species should remain as CR (Possibly Extinct), rather than Extinct (EX), pending the results of a range-wide survey planned for November-December 2017.</p>  <p>The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) based on the following criteria:</p>  <ul><li><strong>Criterion C2a:</strong> There were far fewer than 250 mature individuals, and, if the Baiji was not already extinct by 2008, a continuing decline in the numbers of mature individuals could be inferred or projected, and all individuals belonged to a single subpopulation.</li><li><strong>Criterion D: </strong>There were certainly fewer than 50 mature individuals. </li></ul>  <p>The following factors justify retaining the classification of the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) in the current assessment:  </p><ul><li>The last confirmed record of the species was in 2002 and its decline was well documented before its disappearance.</li><li>The “severe threatening processes” known to have occurred have not been significantly addressed and remain unabated.</li><li>The Baiji was confined to a single, albeit large, freshwater basin, which given the massive human presence there, “predisposed” the species to extinction.</li><li>If any individuals remained, their presence almost certainly would have been documented given the strong human presence in the species’ historical extent of occurrence.</li><li>Surveys conducted since the early 2000s, which failed to detect any Baijis, have been “adequate and appropriate to the species’ detectability.” The surveys were comprehensive in their coverage and included the use of both visual and acoustic techniques, with state-of-the-art equipment employed by experienced researchers. Local reports of sightings since 2002 are unconfirmed.</li><li>The Baiji’s habitat remains highly degraded and unsafe for other riverine megafauna. This is demonstrated by the fact that the Yangtze Finless Porpoise subspecies (<em>Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis</em>), which was sympatric with the Baiji, has continued to decline and is listed as CR (Wang<em> et al.</em> 2013). Other megafauna in the Yangtze River face a similar situation, including the CR (Possibly Extinct) Yangtze Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser dabryanus</em>)<em> </em>(Wei 2010a) and Chinese Paddlefish (<em>Psephurus gladius</em>)<em> </em>(Wei 2010b)<em> </em>and the CR Chinese Alligator (<em>Alligator sinensis</em>) (Crocodile Specialist Group 1996) and Yangtze Giant Softshell Turtle (<em>Rafetus swinhoei</em>) (Asian Turtle Trade Working Group 2000).</li></ul>","Baiji have been generally found in eddy counter-currents below meanders and channel convergences (Hua <em>et al</em>. 1989, Zhou and Li 1989, Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2003). They are known to prey on fish of many sizes and various species, including both surface and bottom feeders (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997).","<p></p><p>The decline in Baiji abundance was caused by a combination of factors. The most consequential were probably incidental mortality from interactions with fisheries and loss and/or degradation of habitat by water development and management of navigation channels (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2013). Other threats contributing to the species’ probable extinction include some level of direct historical exploitation (e.g., during China’s “great leap forward” the Baiji’s traditionally venerated status as Goddess of the River was denounced and Baiji skin was used to produce handbags and gloves; Zhou and Zhang 1991), vessel strikes, harbour construction, sedimentation from poor land use practices, and pollution.<br/> <br/> Entanglement in fishing gear in the 1970s and 1980s was estimated to have been responsible for at least half of observed mortality (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Chen 1989, Zhou and Li 1989). Longlines with thousands of unbaited hooks used for snagging bottom fish (""rolling hooks"") accounted for seven of 13 entanglement deaths recorded in the lower Yangtze between 1978 and 1985 (Zhou and Li 1989) and 15 of 28 in the middle reaches between 1973 and 1983 (Zhou and Wang 1994). Additional deaths from entanglement in rolling hooks were documented in the 1990s (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998). Baijis often had scars and open wounds from rolling hooks, and hook remains were sometimes found in the stomachs of dead animals (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Zhou and Li 1989). Deaths also resulted from entanglement in gill nets and fyke nets (Zhou and Wang 1994). According to Zhou<em> et al.</em> (1998), both rolling hooks and fyke nets were banned in the Yangtze ""because both are harmful to fisheries resources, and because of incidental killing of Baiji,” but enforcement of these prohibitions was ""very difficult.""<br/> <br/> Electric fishing, although ""strictly banned"" in the Yangtze (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998), has been widely practised, particularly in the centre of the Baiji's distribution (International Whaling Commission (IWC) 2001). By the early 2000s this fishing method had come to be viewed as the most important and immediate direct threat to the Baiji's survival (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Although there are few direct observations to support this, it was reported that electric shocks killed Baijis outright (Chen and Hua 1989, IWC 2001). It is well known that such shocks can kill some other aquatic organisms, possibly including those that were prey of Baijis. In the 2006 Yangtze River survey, illegal fishing activities were observed daily along the river and 1,175 fishing vessels were logged between Yichang and Shanghai alone (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/> <br/> Propeller and vessel strikes have killed and injured Baijis (Zhou and Zhang 1991, Chen<em> et al.</em> 1997) and were considered a significant threat to the species, especially in view of the rapid industrial and economic growth of China with its associated expansion of traffic on the Yangtze (Chen 1989, Chen and Hua 1989, Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998). During the 2006 Baiji survey, a minimum of 19,830 large shipping vessels were counted (more than one vessel per 100 m of river surveyed) (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/> <br/> Explosives used to deepen or widen river channels or for fishing were another cause of Baiji mortality (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Zhou and Li 1989, IWC 2001).<br/> <br/> Water development has transformed the Baiji's habitat in important ways, for example blocking of animal movements by dams and barrages, eliminating access to tributaries and appended lakes, and reducing fish productivity<em></em>. A dead Baiji found at the bottom of a gate for a ship lock in a Yangtze tributary may have been killed accidentally by the structure (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000). Chen and Hua (1989) predicted that the controversial Three Gorges Dam, completed in the early 2000s, would eliminate counter-current habitat for approximately 200 km downstream and degrade the existing counter-current systems for another 160 km downstream. Further, stratification in the reservoir will have caused the water released below the dam to be cooler than previously, potentially affecting Baijis and their prey. The downstream effects of Gezhouba Dam were not as extreme as those predicted for Three Gorges Dam because the former is a low-head, run-of-the-river structure (Zhong and Power 1996), meaning that sediment is allowed to pass through (which allows the formation of the counter-currents where Baijis were often found) and no reservoir forms. Another effect of Three Gorges Dam was to facilitate large ship traffic in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and thereby increase the amount of underwater noise, and it would have increased the incidence of vessel strikes of Baijis (Chen and Hua 1989).<br/> <br/> Industrial expansion and intensified agriculture (both facilitated by water development) have caused major ecological problems in the Yangtze system. For example, Dongting and Poyang Lakes have become much shallower because of siltation from deforestation and agricultural development; in fact, it was suggested that Dongting Lake could disappear completely early in the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/> <br/> Pollutant loads in the Yangtze have increased with industrialization and the spread of modern agricultural practices. As of the 1990s, approximately 40% of China's industrial and agricultural output came from the Yangtze basin, with more than 16 billion cubic meters of wastewater discharged into the river annually, of which more than 12 billion cubic meters was industrially polluted and largely untreated (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998).</p>","The first estimate of abundance based on quantitative survey data (1979-81) was made by Zhou (1982), who concluded that the total population comprised only about 400 animals. On the basis of surveys conducted in 1985-86, Chen and Hua (1989) made an educated guess that the total population was around 300. Surveys by Zhou and Li (1989) between 1982 and 1986 suggested that there were 100 Baijis in a 770 km segment of the lower Yangtze from Hukou to the river mouth, compared with 78-79 dolphins counted by Chen and Hua (1989) in the same segment in 1985-86. Repeated surveys of a 500 km segment of the lower Yangtze (Nanjing-Hukou) in 1989-91 produced a maximal count of 12 individuals, leading Zhou <em>et al</em>. (1998) to infer a total abundance of about 30 Baijis in that river segment. Those authors reasoned that if the species still inhabited its historical range of about 1,700 linear kilometers of river, with a density similar to that found in their study area, the total population in the early 1990s would have been only about 100. Attempted comprehensive surveys of the entire species range in 1997-99 resulted in a maximal count (November 1997) of 13 dolphins (including one calf), leading to the generally accepted view that abundance had continued to decline and that the total population was by that time extremely small. The sighting rate in the three years of surveys declined at an annual rate of about 10% (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although no credible time series of counts or abundance estimates is available to provide a rigorous evaluation of trends, there is an overwhelming consensus that the Baiji population declined rapidly over several decades before its probable extinction in the early 2000s.<br/> <br/> The last documented sighting (supported by photographic evidence) was in 2002 and the last confirmed stranding was in 2001. In November and December 2006, a comprehensive visual and acoustic survey failed to find a single Baiji in the Yangtze River (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2007). Two research vessels covered the known habitat of Baijis from Yichang to Shanghai in both the upstream and downstream directions (for double coverage on both sides of the river). In addition, one vessel towed a hydrophone to listen for Baiji whistles and clicks during the downstream survey. Although Dongting and Poyang Lakes were not covered in the 2006 Yangtze mainstem survey, since 2000 no Baijis have been seen by researchers studying Finless Porpoises in those lakes. Another survey conducted for Finless Porpoises in 2012 also failed to detect any Baijis (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2014). One of the assessors (WD) received reports and hazy video footage of a Baiji sighting in the Tongling area of the Yangtze in 2007 but the species identification could not be confirmed. There are more recent unconfirmed reports of Baiji sightings by student volunteers and older fishermen but no photographic, video, or acoustic evidence is available to assess the reliability of these reports. In view of the unconfirmed reports, a precautionary approach has been taken by retaining the classification of the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) rather than changing it to EX, pending the results of a third range-wide survey from Yichang to Shanghai, using the same rigorous methods as were used in surveys conducted in 2006 and 2012, this time with more targeted survey effort in Tongling. If these surveys fail to find a Baiji, the case for changing the species’ status from Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) to Extinct will be particularly strong.",Decreasing,"The Baiji is endemic to the Yangtze River of China. Some individuals were seen in the Qiantang River, immediately south of the Yangtze, after the great flood of 1955 but they disappeared after construction of a hydropower station in 1957 (Zhou 2009). Baijis also occurred in Dongting and Poyang Lakes (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1977, Chen<em> et al.</em> 1980) but disappeared from both of these appended water bodies of the Yangtze by the 1990s (Yang<em> et al.</em> 2000, Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Their upstream limit in the Yangtze declined from the Three Gorges area approximately 35 km above Gezhouba Dam near Yichang in the 1940s to approximately 170 km below the dam site near Jingzhou (formerly called Shashi) in the 1990s (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003, Zhou 2009). These dolphins were once observed as far downstream as the river mouth near Shanghai (Zhou and Li 1989). No dolphins were found downstream of Jiangyin, located 256 km upstream of the mouth, during surveys in 1997-99 (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). During surveys in the late 1990s, Baijis were found mainly in several segments of the Yangtze between Tongling and Dongting Lake, such as the Tongling section, the Poyang Lake mouth area, and the Honghu section (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Turvey<em> et al.</em> (2010) concluded from community interviews along the length of the Yangtze River that while the Baiji steadily declined in abundance, this decline “was not associated with any major contraction in geographical range across the middle–lower Yangtze drainage, even in the decade immediately before probable global extinction of the species.” Hazy video footage taken in the Tongling area of the Yangtze in 2007 may have been a Baiji but the species identification could not be confirmed. Also, during the last two years there have been unconfirmed reports of sightings made by a team of student volunteers and older fishermen near Tongling (Wang Ding, unpubl. data).<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>",There is no current trade in or use of this species or its products.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>In China, the Baiji is designated in the First Category of National Key Protected Wildlife Species and has full legal protection throughout its range. Protection from deliberate killing or injury appears to have been effective but, as noted under Threats, prohibitions on harmful fishing methods were generally not very effective and Baijis continued to suffer from the mortality, injury, and health impairment caused by the other threats listed.<br/> <br/> For several decades, those involved in trying to save the Baiji could not reach consensus on whether conservation should focus principally on <em>in situ</em> efforts to manage threats or on capturing some Baijis from the wild and moving them to a captive or semi-captive environment (IWC 2001, Reeves<em> et al.</em> 2003). From the late 1980s onwards, the primary strategy to prevent the Baiji's extinction was to capture as many dolphins as possible and to introduce them into ""semi-natural reserves,"" one of which (Tongling) was approved by the Chinese government in the 1980s, and the other (Shishou) in the 1990s. The approach of using semi-natural reserves as components of a broad-based conservation strategy was endorsed by international meetings of scientists in 1986 (Perrin and Brownell 1989) and 1993 (Ellis<em> et al.</em> 1993, Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1994). By 2005, establishment of an <em>ex situ</em> breeding population under semi-natural conditions was regarded as the essential short-term goal for the continued survival of the species (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2005, Reeves and Gales 2006, Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2006, Wang<em> et al.</em> 2006, Yang<em> et al.</em> 2006). This was premised on the assumption that the total population of the species was small and declining rapidly and that the factors responsible for the species’ decline (severe habitat degradation; rolling hook, electric and explosive fishing; and boat strikes) were still at work and may have been increasing. The favoured site for establishing this population was the Tian-e-zhou National Baiji Reserve, a 21 km oxbow appended to the Yangtze near Shishou City, Hubei Province, which since 1990 has supported a translocated breeding population of Yangtze Finless Porpoises. However, the expectation that sufficient numbers of Baijis could be caught and placed in the reserves to establish a viable <em>ex situ</em> population proved unrealistic. Six capture expeditions, each lasting 2-3 months, were conducted between Chenglingji and Gongan in the 1990s but Baijis proved extremely difficult to locate, track, and capture. In 1995, a female Baiji was caught and released in the Shishou reserve. Less than seven months later her carcass was found entangled in the escape prevention net at the outlet of the reserve. At that time, one other Baiji was in captivity – a male (Qi Qi) that had been rescued from fishing gear in 1980 and rehabilitated. Qi Qi remained alone in his dolphinarium tank at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan until he died in 2002 </p>  <p>The Scientific Committee of the IWC reviewed the status of the Baiji in 2000, but members were unable to reach consensus on whether further attempts at live-capture should be made (IWC 2001). The IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group recommended in 2003 that: (1) available resources should be devoted to eliminating the known threats to the species in its natural habitat; (2) immediate action should be taken at national, provincial and local levels to fully enforce the bans on rolling hooks and electric fishing; and (3) if the capture/translocation effort continues, capture operations should be improved to prevent dolphin injury or mortality, water quality in the reserve should be kept at a high standard, and Finless Porpoises should be removed to ensure against deleterious interactions between them and the Baiji(s) (Reeves<em> et al.</em> 2003). In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture developed a Baiji conservation plan emphasizing the <em>ex situ</em> approach (Ministry of Agriculture 2001).</p>  <p>The Yangtze region is home to approximately 10% of the world’s human population and the Yangtze River has been undergoing progressive ecological deterioration for many decades. The Baiji is the victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled and unselective fishing (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007) </p>  <p>Conservation actions for Baijis may be too late to prevent its extinction. However, such actions can be justified by the fact that almost any substantial conservation measures in the Yangtze will benefit the Critically Endangered Yangtze Finless Porpoise, which is the world’s only freshwater porpoise and was sympatric with the Baiji before the latter’s disappearance. Research should concentrate on confirming the presence or absence of Baijis through rigorous searching effort. This effort should include the range-wide survey planned for November to December 2017 from Yichang to Shanghai in both the upstream and downstream directions (for double coverage on both sides of the river) using visual observers with high-powered binoculars and an acoustic search with a towed hydrophone to listen for Baiji whistles and clicks. &#160;Searching effort should also include more intensive surveys using both visual and acoustic techniques in the area around Tongling where recent unconfirmed observations of Baijis were reported. If a Baiji is found during any of these surveys, the conservation recommendations made by the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group in 2003 (see above) would remain valid.</p>  <p>The Baiji is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</p>",Palearctic,2002,true,false,Global

There is limited information on global abundance and none on trends in abundance for this species however it is widely distributed and there are areas where it is frequently encountered and is locally common. </p>  <p>The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. DD was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” Although the information is sparse, this species has the most extensive distribution of any species in the <em>Mesoplodon</em> genus, and the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied. Therefore, it was concluded that the species does not belong in the DD category. </p>  <p>This species is common in many areas but it is potentially vulnerable to low-level threats in some parts of its range. Therefore, the species is listed as LC. However, localized populations are known and threats from anthropogenic noise could result in subpopulations that would qualify for threatened categories.</p>","<p>Blainville’s Beaked Whale sightings are common enough around some oceanic archipelagos that long-term studies have been conducted for years (e.g., Canary Islands, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Reyes Suárez 2017; Hawaiian Islands, Schorr <em>et al.</em> 2009, Baird 2019; Bahamas, Joyce <em>et al</em>. 2017); consequently, there is much more known about <em>M. densirostris</em> than any other mesoplodont (see Allen <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012; and Baird 2019 for recent reviews). Like all beaked whales, Blainville’s Beaked Whale is a deep diver, found mainly in deep, oceanic waters, but they can occur close to shore, especially around islands and continental shelf edges (MacLeod and Zuur 2005). In Hawaii, there appears to be a resident, island-associated population, and a more pelagic, open-ocean population with overlapping ranges. There is high site-fidelity among the Hawaii resident types, with re-sightings spanning more than 20 yr in some cases (Baird <em>et al.</em> 2011, Baird 2019). Median group size in Hawaii is 3 (range 1-11), generally with no long-lasting associations, and most groups have only a single adult male present.</p>  <p>Maximum dive depth and time recorded for Blainville’s Beaked Whale in Hawaii is 1,599 m and 83.4 min, respectively; it regularly dives to 1000 m and for over 1 hr, which, for slope-inhabiting populations, suggests that they are foraging at or near the bottom (Arranz <em>et al</em>. 2011, Baird <em>et al</em>. 2006, Baird 2019). Three different types of dives have been recorded: long, deep dives for foraging; short, shallow (2-4 m) dives near the surface for breathing, and a series of intermediate dives (30-300 m) that appear to help them avoid detection by predators (sharks and killer whales) when they are near the surface (Augilar de Soto <em>et al.</em> 2011, Baird 2019).</p>  <p>Little is known about the prey of Blainville’s Beaked Whale. A review by Allen <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that stomach contents from stranded whales consisted mainly of beaks and otoliths from various species of meso- and bathypelagic squids and fishes, and some crustaceans. Like all ziphiids, Blainville’s Beaked Whale is a suction feeder (Heyning and Mead 1996), and Madsen <em>et al.</em> (2013) suggested they catch, on average, about 25 individual prey items/dive.</p>","<p>There has never been a directed fishery for this species, but small numbers are taken opportunistically and incidentally in fishing gear. Dolar (1994) investigated directed fisheries for marine mammals in the Philippines and reported that hunters at Pamilacan Island sometimes take small whales, including <em>M. densirostris</em>. Also taken opportunistically in the past off Japan. Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts are known to become entangled and drowned (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009), including Blainville’s Beaked Whale (Jefferson et al. 1993, Ilangakoon 2002, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Blainville’s Beaked Whales are occasionally hooked in longline gear (Forney 2010).<br/> <br/> Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). In 1993, an adult Blainville's Beaked Whale that washed ashore in southern Brazil had a bundle of plastic threads that occupied a large part of the main stomach chamber (Secchi and Zarzur 1999). Both stomach and intestines were completely free of parasites, as well as food remains and feces, indicating that the whale had not fed for some time. The ingested plastic may have resulted in a false sensation of satiation for the animal, which could have reduced the whale's appetite and meal size and, in turn, led to the death of the whale. This form of pollution may be increasing and could be a threat to the species.</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as those from active sonar and seismic survey operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of mid-frequency active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in mass strandings of beaked whales, including Blainville’s Beaked Whales (Balcomb and Claridge 2001,&#160; D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em> . 2019). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em> . 2019). Sub-lethal effects may also occur, with Blainville’s Beaked Whales reducing foraging activity (as measured by echolocation) and moving away from Navy vessels using mid-frequency active sonar (e.g., Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2016; Manzano-Roth <em>et al</em>. 2016; Joyce <em>et al.</em> 2020). This has the potential to result in reduced reproductive rates for individuals that are regularly exposed to mid-frequency active sonar (New <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, although the nature of impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in various species of mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987), including moderate levels in Blainville’s Beaked Whales (Taruski <em>et al</em>., 1975, Aguilar<em> et al</em>. 1982; Bachman <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>  <p>Mesoplodonts are small whales that normally live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some cases have been reported (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2009, Schoeman <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160; </p>","<p>Overall, Blainville’s Beaked Whale is fairly common in at least some areas of its range and is considered to be perhaps the most abundant species of <em>Mesoplodon</em> (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Estimates of abundance are generally unavailable for most areas. In the Hawaiian EEZ waters Bradford <em>et al</em>. (in press) estimated 839 (CV=1.05) Blainville’s Beaked Whales in 2002, 1,740 (CV=1.05) in 2010, and 1,132 (CV=.99) in 2017. Off Hawaii Island Baird <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated 125 “marked” individuals (CV=.30) using photo-identification over a four-year period (2003-2006), with a corrected estimate (accounting for unmarked individuals) of 140. Mullin and Fulling (2004) estimated 106 (CV=.41) mesoplodonts in the northern Gulf of Mexico, including both <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. europaeus</em>. Waring <em>et al.</em> (2009) later estimated 57 (CV=1.40) mesoplodonts (<em>i.e</em>., <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. europaeus</em>, combined) in the Gulf of Mexico from a later set of surveys. Ferguson and Barlow (2001) estimated a total of 32,678 mesoplodonts in the eastern Pacific (corrected for missed animals), in an area where nearly all the identified mesoplodonts are either <em>M. peruvianus</em> or <em>M. densirostris</em> (Pitman and Lynn 2001, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009). During a line transect acoustic and visual survey of the entire coast of Tanzania, Blainville’s Beaked Whales were the fourth most frequently encountered marine mammal (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2018). In areas where satellite tagging and/or photo-identification studies have been undertaken (e.g., Hawaii, Bahamas, Canary Islands) limited movements and strong site fidelity have been documented, suggesting substantial population structure (Baird 2019, Claridge 2013, Joyce <em>et al.</em> 2020, Reyes Suárez 2017). </p>",Unknown,"<p>Blainville’s Beaked Whales are easily the most widely distributed of all the mesoplodont species and occur in tropical and warm temperate waters of all oceans (Mead 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006, Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012). They mostly occur in open ocean waters, but also in some semi-enclosed deep-sea areas, such as the Sea of Japan, Gulf of Thailand, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea but they have not been recorded in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160; In the tropical Western Indian Ocean, Blainville’s Beaked Whales are the most frequently encountered mesoplodont and occur around several island archipelagos including Comoros, Mauritius, Mayotte and the Seychelles (Kiszka 2015, Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; In the eastern North Pacific, sightings and strandings have occurred from 37.3°N to 41.5°S in cooler waters&#160;but are rare in this region (MacLeod <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>",<p>This species is occasionally taken in artisanal fisheries (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>,Marine,"<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

The exact cause of the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;Recurrent mass strandings (8 such events between 1975 and 2018) of apparently healthy Stejneger’s Beaked Whales have occurred near a US naval installation in the Aleutian Islands (Walker<em> </em>and Hanson 1999, Baumann-Pickering et al. 2011). Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). Plastic twine was found in the digestive tracts of two Stejneger’s Beaked Whales, and Walker and Hanson (1999) suggested that this material was ingested incidentally during suction feeding. Yamada <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported that ca. 73% of the stranded specimens in Japan had plastic material in their stomachs. </p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in various other species of mesoplodonts (Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Kajiwara<em> et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). The levels of these residues in mesoplodonts are generally lower than in other small cetaceans but Stejneger’s Beaked Whale is an exception. The organochlorine levels in this species, at least in Japanese waters, are the highest reported for any species of beaked whale and may represent a potential health hazard of unknown significance</p>  <p>Mesoplodonts are small whales that live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes is difficult to document, but some possible cases were reported by Waring <em>et al</em>. (2009). In addition, Honma <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported a Stejneger’s Beaked Whale killed by a vessel in the Sea of Japan. </p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species, although the nature of these impacts is unknown at this time (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of abundance, but, based on strandings in the Aleutian Islands and western Japan, the species does not seem to be especially rare; in Japan alone, 120 strandings were reported between 1999 and 2011 (Tajima <em>et al. </em>2015). There may be a resident subpopulation in the Sea of Japan and southern Okhotsk Sea (Yamada 1997, Walker and Hanson 1999, Kakuda and Yamada 2001, Tajima <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Stejneger's Beaked Whales are found in continental slope and oceanic waters of the North Pacific Ocean, from southern California northward in the east and from the Sea of Japan, including the Korean Peninsula (Park 1999), northward into the southern Okhotsk Sea in the west. They also occur around the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea and throughout the Aleutian Islands (Mead 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006, Yamada 1997). Stejneger’s Beaked Whale appears to be primarily a cold-temperate and subarctic species, and it is the only mesoplodont found in Alaskan waters. It strands most commonly in Alaska, especially in the Aleutian Islands and on the west coast of Japan, with many fewer strandings along Japan’s Pacific coast. </p>",,Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

50369125,16564,Peponocephala electra,Least Concern,,2019,2019-02-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Melon-headed Whale is a tropical and subtropical delphinid species that occurs in large groups in deep oceanic waters worldwide. Global trends in abundance are not available, however, worldwide abundance is at least 180,000 based on the sum of estimates from the eastern tropical Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and the southwestern Indian Ocean.&#160; Since these estimates refer to only a small proportion of the range of the species, the actual total abundance is likely considerably greater. Threats that could cause declines include high levels of anthropogenic sound, especially military sonar and bathymetric surveys, and localized interactions with drift gillnet and pelagic longline fisheries. </p>  <p>The Melon-headed Whale was assessed as Least Concern in 2008. The species has a moderate global abundance and a widespread tropical distribution, and while there is little information available on trends in abundance, no major threats have been identified that are likely to be causing a global decline of the species. It is therefore again assessed as Least Concern.</p>","<p>Melon-headed Whales occur in deep oceanic waters. Sightings are relatively rare over the continental shelf (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009). They can be common around some oceanic islands where ocean bottom topography is steep (for a review see Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009). They are primarily distributed in waters ranging from 300 to 2,000 meters in depth (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009; Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2011; Baird <em>et al</em>. 2013; Aschettino <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the eastern tropical Pacific, the distribution of sightings suggests that the oceanic habitat of this species is primarily in upwelling-modified and equatorial waters (Perryman<em> et al</em>. 1994). Off the main Hawaiian Islands, Melon-headed Whales use cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies as offshore foraging grounds (Woodworth <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>Around the main Hawaiian Islands, two populations have been identified using photo-identification data: one exclusively observed in the coastal waters (median depth of encounter = 381 m) off the northwestern region of the island of Hawai’i and another larger population occurring in deeper oceanic waters (median depth of encounter = 1,662 m) throughout the main Hawaiian Islands (Aschettino <em>et al.</em> 2012). Recent genetic studies conducted across the three main ocean basins suggest that Melon-headed Whales, including those that are resident to oceanic islands, maintain a relatively high level of genetic connectivity compared to other species of large delphinids such as Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala</em> spp.), Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) and other ‘blackfish’ (Martien <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Melon-headed Whales usually form large groups of up to 1,000 individuals, but these groups usually contain an assemblage of smaller units (Brownell <em>et al.</em> 2009). They also frequently associate with other species, such as Fraser’s Dolphins (<em>Lagenodelphis hosei</em>) and Short-finned Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala macrorhynchus</em>) (Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2006; Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Melon-headed Whales are nocturnal predators feeding on a variety of mesopelagic fishes, squids, and shrimps (Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2011, West <em>et al</em>. 2018). In Hawaii, the relative contribution of mesopelagic fish and cephalopods is roughly equivalent (West <em>et al</em>. 2018). Melon-headed Whales (along with other large delphinids such as False Killer Whales <em>Pseudorca crassidens</em>) could be important foraging facilitators for species of epipelagic seabirds foraging in tropical oligotrophic waters, particularly Procellariiformes (Pitman and Balance 1992; Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2015).","<p>Melon-headed Whales were hunted in Hawaii at least in the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century. They were hunted historically in the Solomon Islands in small numbers. They are killed occasionally in small-scale hunts targeting cetaceans, including in Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the eastern Caribbean Sea (Caldwell <em>et al.</em> 1975; Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993; Perryman <em>et al</em>. 1994; Dolar <em>et al</em>. 1994; Ilangakoon 1997; Mustika 2006). In the past, Melon-headed Whales were taken only occasionally in Japanese hunts (Kasuya 2017), however, catches have increased recently in the drive hunt off Taiji. In the 2017/2018 season the catch limit was 704 individuals and at least 7 groups were driven ashore to be killed or for use in aquariums (IWC 2018). Dolar <em>et al</em>. (1994) investigated the hunts for marine mammals in the central and southern Visayas, northern Mindanao and Palawan, Philippines. Hunters at several sites took Melon-headed Whales for bait or human consumption. In Sri Lanka, Ilangakoon (1997) reported that about 4% of the cetaceans delivered to four fish landing sites between May 1985 and December 1988 were Melon-headed Whales, at least some of them taken by harpoon.</p>  <p>Melon-headed Whales exhibit injuries due to interactions with pelagic longline fisheries in the Mozambique Channel (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2008). Incidental captures in offshore tuna fisheries are rare in the eastern tropical Pacific (Perryman <em>et al. </em>1994), and have not been recorded in purse-seine fisheries in the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Escalle <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, bycatch of this species has been recorded in tuna drift gillnet fisheries in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997) and India (Jeyabaskaran and Vivekanandan 2013). As with most other cetacean species, bycatch in drift gillnets is likely to occur in most countries of occurrence, but there is little information available on mortality rates.&#160; Bycaught animals are sometimes used as bait in fisheries (Mintzer <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>  <p>Melon-headed Whales are vulnerable to anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by naval sonar and bathymetric mapping with echosounders (Southall <em>et al.</em> 2013). Anomalous movement of Melon-headed Whales into a bay in Hawaii was associated with military sonar (Southall <em>et al</em>. 2006), and the frequency of mass stranding events for this species have increased in the last 30 years (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2006), especially in Japan (Amano <em>et al</em>. 2014). In 2008, a mass stranding event involving about 100 Melon-headed Whales, at least 75 of which died, occurred along the northwest coast of Madagascar. This was linked to the use of a high-power 12 kHz multi-beam echosounder system that was considered to have caused the stranding (Southall <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>  <p>Evidence from stranded individuals of several similar species indicated that they had swallowed discarded plastic items, which may have eventually led to their deaths (e.g. Lusher <em>et al. </em>2018). Off Japan, concentrations of PCBs, DDTs, and HCB in Melon-headed Whales have decreased during the 1980-2000 period, whereas PBDE and CHL levels showed a temporal increase (Kajiwara <em>et al. </em>2008). Individuals in both Hawaii and Japan had PCB concentrations at levels thought to be capable of causing toxic effects (Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2008; Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>","<p>Melon-headed Whales can be relatively common in some areas of their range, for example where deep water approaches islands, such as around the main Hawaiian Islands (Aschettino <em>et al.</em> 2012), in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (Dulau-Drouot <em>et al. </em>2008, Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010, 2011) and around some archipelagos in the western tropical Pacific (e.g. Marquesas Islands) (Gannier 2000; 2002). However, only a few abundance estimates are available.&#160; </p>  <p>In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the best available estimate is 2,235 individuals (CV=0.75) based on a summer 2009 survey covering the US EEZ seaward of the 200m isobath (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). Insufficient sightings in the western North Atlantic mean that it has not been possible to estimate abundance which however is very low (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2007). No other estimates are available for other tropical regions of the Atlantic.</p>  In the eastern tropical Pacific, based on large-scale surveys conducted between 1986 and 1990, 45,400 (CV=47%) Melon-headed Whales were estimated (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands EEZ resulted in abundance estimates of 2,947 (CV=1.17) in 2002 (Barlow 2006) and 2,860 (CV=1.04) in 2010 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2013). Mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data collected between 2002 and 2009 resulted in abundance estimates of 5,794 (CV=0.20) in the main Hawaiian Islands population and 447 (CV=0.12) in the Hawai’i (Big Island) resident population (Aschettino 2010). In the eastern Sulu Sea and in the Tañon Strait in the Philippines, 921 (CV=83%) and 1,383 (CV=82%) individuals, respectively, were estimated from line transect surveys conducted in 1994 and 1995 (Dolar <em>et al. </em>2006). In the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean, aerial surveys were conducted between December 2009 and April 2010, and allowed to generate abundance of small Globicephalinae (<em>Feresa attenuata</em> and <em>P. electra</em>) of which the majority of individuals are likely to be Melon-headed Whales (Laran <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the Mozambique Channel, abundance was estimated across three survey blocks; northern (97,598, CV=33%), central (24,360, CV=47%) and southern (9,581, CV=72%) (Laran <em>et al. </em>2017).",Unknown,"<p>Melon-headed Whales occur mainly in tropical and subtropical waters between 40°N and 35°S (Perryman and Danil 2018). A few extralimital strandings have been recorded in western Europe (England, France), Maryland (USA), central Japan, and Cape Province (South Africa) (Best &amp; Shaughnessy 1981; Perryman <em>et al</em>. 1994; Spitz <em>et al. </em>2011; Amano <em>et al</em>. 2014). Melon-headed Whales occur in deep oceanic waters, but are frequently associated with oceanic islands and archipelagoes (Brownell <em>et al. </em>2009). &#160;They are frequently encountered around the main Hawaiian Islands (Aschettino <em>et al</em>. 2012), western Indian Ocean islands such as La Reunion and the Comoros (Dulau-Drouot <em>et al. </em>2008, Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010, 2011), Timor-Leste in eastern Indonesia (Mustika 2006), and Palmyra in the central Pacific (Brownell <em>et al. </em>2009). In French Polynesia, they are relatively common around the Marquesas (Gannier 2002), but uncommon in the Society Islands (Gannier 2000). In the Wider Caribbean Region, they occur in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Mullin <em>et al. </em>1994) and in the Lesser Antilles, but are relatively uncommon (Watkins <em>et al. </em>1997, Yoshida <em>et al. </em>2010). &#160;They have not been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea&#160;or the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara e<em>t al</em>. 2017).<strong></strong></p>","<p>Melon-headed Whales are taken occasionally in small numbers by hunting directed at cetaceans in Japan, Saint Vincent, Taiwan, West Africa, and possibly elsewhere.

50377701,21500,Tasmacetus shepherdi,Data Deficient,,2018,2018-03-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The external appearance of Shepherd's Beaked Whale (<em>Tasmacetus shepherdi</em>)   was only described in detail in 2006 (Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2006). It is known from only a few tens of sightings and a few strandings, all in the southern hemisphere. There is no information on global abundance or trends in abundance for this species. The limited number of records suggests that they are not common, or they are distributed principally very far from land and difficult to detect and identify, or both of these (Mead 2018). Even in Australia and New Zealand where the majority of sightings have been made, the species appears to be rare (Donnelly <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Shepherd’s Beaked Whale was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008 and it remains extremely data-poor. The Red List Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) state that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD”. In this instance Critically Endangered (if it is rare and declining) and Least Concern (if it is common but largely undetected or misidentified) are both plausible categories and it therefore continues to be classified as Data Deficient. </p>","<p>This species generally lives far offshore, well away from coasts; however, where there is a narrow continental shelf, Shepherd’s Beaked Whales may sometimes occur in deep water close to shore. Information on this species is derived from a very limited number of verified sightings and a handful of strandings, therefore its <span lang=""EN-IE"">habitat preferences remain poorly understood (Donnelly <em>et al</em> 2018). Almost all sightings in Australia (n=12) and New Zealand (n=6) were in continental slope waters with depths exceeding 310 m. Mean depth of all sightings was 1,208 ±871 m, and only one sighting (3,940 m) was recorded in waters deeper than 2,000 m (Donnelly <em>et al</em>. 2018). In Australia and New Zealand, observed group sizes ranged between 2 and 14 individuals.<br/><br/>Shepherd’s Beaked Whales are known to feed on several species of fish (primarily eelpouts), as well as squid and crabs, possibly near the bottom in deep waters. This seems somewhat unusual, as most Beaked Whales appear to feed almost exclusively on cephalopods.<br/><br/>Adults are between 6 and 7 m in length, and calves are still with their mother when they are 340 cm long (Mead 2018). One adult male had 23 growth layer groups in its teeth and was presumably 23 years old (Grandi <em>et al.</em> 2005).</p>  <p></p>","No major threats are known for Shepherd’s Beaked Whales. As is true for most of the Beaked Whales, this species has never been hunted and fisheries interactions are not known.<br/> <br/> Evidence from some stranded individuals indicated that they had swallowed discarded plastic items (Mead 2018), which can eventually lead to death in some instances (e.g. Scott <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/> <br/> Like other beaked whales, Shepherd’s Beaked Whales are likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by navy sonar and seismic surveys (Cox <em>et al</em>. 2006, Southall <em>et al.</em> 2016, Balcomb and Claridge 2001).",<p>The external appearance of the species was not well known until it was re-described from several fresh specimens and at-sea sightings in 2006 (Pitman <em>et al</em>. 2006).

To date, all at-sea observations accompanied by photographs to verify the species have been from regions south of 30°S (MacLeod <em>et al.</em> 2005) and north of 46°S, suggesting that the species has a circumpolar distribution in cold temperate waters of the southern hemisphere.<br/><br/>It is possible that the species is somewhat more widespread than the limited records suggest, since it was not likely to be accurately identified at sea until its recent re-description in 2006 (Pitman <em>et al</em>. 2006).

50379111,23211,Ziphius cavirostris,Least Concern,,2020,2018-10-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p>The global abundance and trend of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales are unknown but given their range and regional abundance estimates that do exist, the species numbers at least 100,000. They are very widely distributed in oceanic waters worldwide. They are uncommon south of the Antarctic Convergence (60°S) (Branch and Butterworth 2001). Principal threats include high levels of anthropogenic sound, especially military sonar and seismic surveys in the Northern Hemisphere, and fishery bycatch. As a species, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales do not meet any IUCN Red List criteria for a threatened listing and are considered Least Concern. The Mediterranean subpopulation is classified as Vulnerable on the Red List (Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018).<em> </em>It is likely that other subpopulations exist, and once identified they could be assessed separately.</p><p></p>","<p>Although they can be found nearly anywhere in deep (&gt;200 m) oceanic waters, Cuvier’s Beaked Whale is an oceanic species often associated with steep slope habitat with a marked preference for submarine canyons and escarpments (Azzellino <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2012, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2003, MacLeod 2005, Podestá <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cañadas and Vazquez 2014, Cañadas <em>et al.</em> 2017). Off Japan, whaling records indicate that <em>Z. cavirostris</em> is most commonly found in waters deeper than 1,000 m (Heyning 1989). The species is known around many oceanic islands (e.g., Baird 2016,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Reyes Suárez 2018)., and in some enclosed seas. It is rarely found close to mainland shores, except in submarine canyons or in areas where the continental shelf is narrow and coastal waters are deep (Heyning 1989, 2002) and is mostly a pelagic species that appears to be confined by the 10°C isotherm and the 1,000 m bathymetric contour (Houston 1991, Robineau and di Natale 1995).<br/> <br/> Like all beaked whales, Cuvier's Beaked Whales appear to prefer deep waters for feeding. They regularly dive over 1,000 m and have been recorded diving to a depth of 2,992 m and for up to 137.5 minutes (Schorr <em>et al</em>. 2014, Baird 2019, Shearer <em>et al.</em> 2019). They appear to feed mostly on deep-sea squid, but also sometimes take fish and crustaceans (Heyning 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005). In the North Pacific West <em>et al.</em> (2017) noted fish in three of 16 stomachs examined, representing 12.1% of prey by mass overall. While five families of fish were documented, one species, <em>Albatrossia pectoralis,</em> made up 97% of the fish prey items documented. In addition, otoliths from the codling family Moridae were found in a specimen from South Africa (Sekiguchi 1994). They apparently feed both near the bottom and in the water column. As with other beaked whales, suction appears to be used to draw prey items into the mouth at close range (Heyning and Mead 1996).</p>","<p>Because of&#160;their offshore occurrence and tendency to feed on deep-sea squid, Cuvier’s&#160;Beaked Whales are probably little exposed to human activities that occur in coastal waters (tourism, many types of fisheries, etc.). However, the few studies carried out on this species highlight one main threat, which is certain forms of human caused underwater noise. This threat affects the species world-wide. Military sonars and possibly high-energy sounds from other anthropogenic sources have repeatedly resulted in the stranding and death of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales. Recent atypical mass strandings (AMSs) of Beaked Whales have been linked to high-powered naval sonar and seismic exploration (e.g., Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004, Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2005). Deployment of military sonar has led to strandings of beaked whales suffering from chronic and acute tissue damage due to the <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly the result of decompression sickness (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2005). In particular, several AMSs of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales have been associated with naval activities in the Canary Islands, from the mid- to late-1980s until 2004 (Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em>. 2019). In 2004 a moratorium on mid-frequency active sonar was established by the Spanish Government around the Canary Islands and there have not been any additional AMSs since. Another AMS event occurred in March 2000 in the Bahamas during a naval exercise (Rowles <em>et al</em>. 2000, Anon. 2001). A number of AMS events in the Mediterranean were consistent with naval activity in the region (Podestà <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2016, Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018). Moore<em> et al</em>. (2018)<em> </em>also reported that AMSs were strongly correlated in locations (Japan, Puerto Rico and Italy) where US Naval fleets were based. Simonis<em> et al. </em>(2020) report that three of eight Cuvier’s Beaked Whale stranding events in the Mariana Archipelago (totaling 10-11 individuals) between 2006 and February 2019 occurred during or within six days after naval activities, and that this co-occurrence was highly significant. This study also highlighted that both single animal and mass stranding events may be sonar-associated. The US Navy is funding research to explore possible mitigation measures. Geophyical surveys which use airguns for oil and gas exploration are also of concern, particularly in the Mediterranean (Podestà <em>et al</em>. 2016, Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018). A stranding of two Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the Gulf of California was closely correlated with a seismic survey (Malakoff 2002).<em></em></p>  <p>Never a main target of commercial whalers, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales have sometimes been taken as bycatch in other directed fisheries, such as those in the Caribbean Islands, Indonesia, Taiwan, Peru, and Chile (Heyning 1989, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the Japanese <em>Berardius</em> fishery, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales were taken in the past on an opportunistic basis, with catches varying from 3 to 35 animals yearly (Omura <em>et al</em>. 1955). Although the <em>Berardius</em> fishery still continues, there have been no direct takes of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales for decades (Nishiwaki and Oguro 1972).</p>  <p>Bycatch of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales has been reported in several commercial fisheries. Julian and Beeson (1998) reported a mortality of 22-44 individuals per year in the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery from 1992 to 1995.&#160;The introduction of the use of pingers in the fishery in 1996 resulted in a complete cessation of bycatch in this fishery (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Willis and Baird (1998) noted one Cuvier’s Beaked Whale killed in a fishery for flying squid offshore of western Canada in 1986. Notarbartolo di Sciara (1990) reported on two Cuvier's Beaked Whales that were thought to have been killed in the Italian Swordfish (<em>Xiphius gladius</em>) fishery during 1986-1988. Bycatch in the western North Atlantic is very low, with one animal reported between 1994 and 1998 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cuvier’s Beaked Whales are occasionally taken incidentally in driftnets in the Mediterranean Sea. Prior to the driftnet ban of 2002, occasional bycatch in pelagic driftnets was reported from Spanish, French, and Italian waters (Banca Dati Italiana Spiaggiamenti 2015, Podestà and Magnaghi 1989). But, there are also reports of entanglements after the ban. During the MED09 survey in the Alborán Sea, a Cuvier´s Beaked Whale was found alive entangled in a driftnet, and two Moroccan driftnet fishing vessels were spotted a few miles away.&#160;</p>  <p>There are reports of ingestion of plastic debris by Cuvier’s Beaked Whales. Two stranded animals in Greece had stomachs with many pieces of plastic bags (A. Frantzis pers. comm., Frantzis 2009), as did a stranded animal in Croatia (Holcer <em>et al</em>. 2007. Other reports are described in Gomerčić <em>et al</em>. (2006), and Podestà and Meotti (1991). Poncelet <em>et al</em>. (1999) described a considerable amount of plastic debris in the stomach of a Cuvier’s Beaked Whale washed ashore on the French Atlantic coast. </p>  <p>Given their diet is primarily composed of deep-water squid, with smaller contributions of fish and crustaceans (West <em>et al</em>. 2017), there is relatively little competition with commercial fisheries (Arkhipkin <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Low levels of organochlorines were reported from Cuvier’s Beaked Whales from Hawaii and Bermuda (Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Knap and Jickells 1983). Low levels of flame retardant compounds were reported from this species (Law <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of beaked whales, mainly mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016) and is a potential health hazard of unknown significance. However, the residue levels in beaked whales are much lower than other small cetaceans (Cockcroft 1999). High concentrations of mercury, selenium and cadmium have been detected in animals sampled from the Ligurian Sea (Capelli <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em> </em>However, in all reported cases, organochlorine residues found in Southern Hemisphere small cetacean are lower than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (O’Shea <em>et al. </em>1980, Reijnders <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect Cuvier’s Beaked Whales, although the nature of impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p><p></p>","<p>Determining abundance of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales is difficult for several reasons: 1) they are widely distributed in offshore waters of most of the world’s oceans; 2) in areas where multiple species of beaked whales occur some sightings cannot be identified to species; 3) they regularly make long, deep dives and animals may be below the surface and not detected during surveys; and 4) the body size is relatively small and group size is often small making detection in rough offshore waters difficult even if the animals are at the surface.<em> </em>Global abundance of this species is unknown but there are estimates of numbers in some areas. </p>  <p>Wade and Gerrodette (1993) estimated an abundance of about 20,000 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.27) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the eastern tropical Pacific region (19 million km<sup>2</sup>), but a re-analysis of the same data increased the estimate to about 80,000 after accounting for diving animals that were missed (Ferguson and Barlow 2001). Barlow (2003) estimated Cuvier’s Beaked Whale abundance off the U.S. west coast from shipboard surveys as 8,311 (CV = 0.50) in 1991-1993, 1,876 (CV = 0.81) in 1996, and 1,892 (CV =1.08) in 2001. A survey of that same region in 2014 yielded an abundance estimate of 3,775 (CV = 0.68) (Barlow 2016). A trend analysis of all data from surveys conducted during 1991-2014 estimated the number of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in this region as 3,928 (CV = 0.67) in 2014, with evidence of a decline in abundance over the study period that occurred mostly between 1993 and 1996 (Moore and Barlow 2013).</p>  <p>Shipboard surveys of the Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding the Hawaiian Islands in 2002, 2010 and 2017 produced abundance estimates of 1,216 (CV=0.77), 338 (CV=1.01) and 4,431 (CV=0.41) in the three years, respectively (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2020). Cuvier’s Beaked Whales were the most abundant beaked whale of the three species documented in two of the three years (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2020). Using photoidentification data, Baird (2016) estimated that 52 animals used the west side of Hawaii Island over a four-year study period.</p>  <p>Waring <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported results of shipboard and aerial surveys conducted in 2011 in the western North Atlantic from the lower Bay of Fundy to central Florida and estimated 6,532 (CV = 0.32) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the survey area, but these estimates were not corrected to account for those individuals that were diving.<strong> </strong>In an area of 15,765 km<sup>2</sup> off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, McLellan et al. (2018) estimated between 50 (95% CI 30-80) and 90 (95% CI 110-380) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales, depending on the assumptions used regarding surfacing synchronicity. In summer 2009, surveys dedicated to estimating cetacean abundance were conducted in offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico resulting in an abundance estimate for Cuvier’s Beaked Whales of 74 (CV = 1.04). The estimate for unidentified beaked whales was also 74 (CV = 1.04), and may have also included an unknown number of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). Cañadas <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated 2,286 (CV = 0.49) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the European Atlantic based on ship-based surveys conducted during 2005-2009. This estimate was adjusted for unidentified beaked whales but not for diving. Podestà <em>et al.</em> (2016) estimated that about 100 individuals are found in the northern Ligurian Sea. Using photo-identification off El Hierro in the Canary Islands, Reyes Suárez (2017) estimated 87 (95% CI 73-103) or 84 (95% CI 70-101) individuals over a six-year period.</p>  <p>Cuvier’s Beaked Whales are undoubtedly among the most common and abundant of all the beaked whales, and worldwide abundance is likely to be well over 100,000. There is no information on trends in abundance for any population. except off the west coast of the United States (Moore and Barlow 2013). This is the only widely-distributed beaked whale species for which a global assessment of genetic diversity has been conducted. The results of that study suggest that there is probably little movement of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales among ocean basins (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2005). Substantial variation in morphology has been recorded across the range of the Cuvier’s Beaked Whale (Heyning 1989), which suggests the existence of local subpopulations including one in the Mediterranean Sea (Cañadas and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2018). In areas where satellite tagging and/or photoidentification studies have been undertaken (e.g., Hawaii, North Carolina, Ligurian Sea, Canary Islands), limited movements and strong site fidelity has been documented, suggesting substantial subpopulation structure (Baird 2019, Foley <em>et al</em>. in review, Podestà <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reyes Suárez 2018).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Cuvier's Beaked Whales have the most extensive range of any beaked whale species (Heyning 1989, 2002, Baird 2018). They are widely distributed in offshore waters of all oceans, from the tropics to the polar regions, in both hemispheres. Their range covers most marine waters of the world, with the exception of shallow areas and very high-latitude polar regions. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas, such as the Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk (but not in the Baltic,Black or Red Seas). This is the only species of beaked whale regularly found in the Mediterranean Sea (Podestà&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). South of the Antarctic Convergence (60°S) they are uncommon (Branch and Butterworth 2001).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The Cuvier’s Beaked Whale was hunted at a low, and largely opportunistic, level. Nishiwaki and Oguro (1972) reported that 189 Cuvier’s Beaked Whales were caught at coastal whaling station in Japan during 1965-1970 and that such operations had diminished in later years.

The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and across a substantial swath of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere and the western North Pacific. Therefore, it is not rare (see Supplement for definitions), therefore the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied and the species does not belong in the DD category.</p>    This species is not rare and it appears to be fairly common in at least some parts of its large range (see Supplement for definitions), which spans parts of both the Pacific and Indian Oceans.&#160; Longman’s Beaked Whales are vulnerable to low-level threats in a substantial portion of their range. However, well-documented threats (especially anthropogenic noise) are not significant in much of the range. &#160;In addition, the large range allows the potential to contain demographically independent populations that could buffer overall risk to the species. &#160;Plausible categories are NT or LC.&#160; Least Concern is the more appropriate category since the species is fairly common in parts of its large range and subpopulations (demographically independent populations) may exist (see Supplement).","<p>Little is known about the biology of this species.&#160; Live sightings come from scattered locations, mainly in deep, oceanic waters in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, in areas with surface water temperatures of 21-31°C. Dive times of up to 33 min have been recorded (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). School sizes tend to be large and may vary regionally: reported mean school sizes range from 7.2 (western Indian Ocean) to 29.2 (western Pacific), with individual groups ranging from 1-100 individuals (Pitman <em>et al</em>. 1999, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160; Stomach contents of single animals stranded in Japan (Yatabe <em>et al</em>. 2010) and the Philippines (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2012) contained beaks of various mid-water squids.</p>","<p>Little specific information is available on threats to Longman’s Beaked Whales. </p>  <p>Although there has never been a directed fishery for them, pervasive gillnet and longline fisheries throughout their range raise concern that at least some bycatch occurs, as is true for other beaked whales (e.g., Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Sri Lanka, for example, there is evidence of occasional incidental or directed takes of animals identified as Southern Bottlenose Whales (<em>Hyperoodon planifrons</em>, Dayaratne and Joseph 1993), which in retrospect were most likely Longman’s Beaked Whales (Anderson et al. 2006, Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2009). Even low levels of human-caused mortality might be unsustainable for populations of this naturally uncommon species. <br/> <br/> In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;Two Longman’s Beaked Whales (possibly a mother and calf) stranded alive in Taiwan coincident with naval training exercises in the area; at least one of these individuals had lesions consistent with gas embolism (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2008). </p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). Two Longman’s beaked whales examined had plastic in their stomachs (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 2012) and another may have died from ingesting plastic bags (Kaladharan <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in various species of mesoplodonts (Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Kajiwara<em> et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016), including&#160; this species (Bachman <em>et al</em>. 2014), but the potential health hazard is of unknown significance. </p>  <p>All beaked whales normally live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some possible cases have been reported (Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2004, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>  <p>Morbilliviruses became recognized as pathogens in marine mammals in the late 1980s (Van Bressem et al. 2014).

The prevalence and potential impact of morbillivirus on this species is not currently known.<br/> <br/> Predicted effects of global climate change on the marine environment may affect Longman’s Beaked Whales although the nature and severity of impacts are unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>","<p>There is no information on trends in the global abundance of this species.

It can be inferred from the distribution of strandings that the species has a restricted distribution in warm-temperate waters of the Eastern North Pacific off California and may also occur to the south in the waters off Baja California, Mexico, based on (as yet unconfirmed) acoustic detections. This is a small distribution when compared with other beaked whales and is the smallest known range of any species in this poorly known genus. The 1991–2014 abundance estimate for pooled <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (which are not readily distinguishable at sea) across the known range of <em>M. perrini</em> is 1,164 (691, CV=0.59 for Southern California plus 473 (CV=0.86) for Central California) (Table 7 in Barlow 2016). Given the occurrence of several other <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. in the area, this abundance estimate represents an upper bound for <em>M. perrini</em>. The small range of <em>M. perrini</em> overlaps significantly with naval testing ranges off California, where active mid-frequency sonar, known to be implicated in strandings of <em>Mesoplodon</em> species and other beaked whales, is used. Mesoplodonts are also known to be subject to bycatch in drift nets, and to plastics ingestion. An inferred continuing decline is therefore considered probable. Given that the mature population size (which for cetaceans is in the range 35-75% of the total population size; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) is below 2,500, the species qualifies as Endangered under criterion C2a(ii). Because the abundance used is pooled over several species, it is also plausible that this species may qualify as Critically Endangered (CR) with fewer than 250 mature individuals. </p>","<p>Almost nothing is known about the biology of this species. Although there have been no confirmed live sightings, it is assumed that, like all other members of the genus, Perrin’s Beaked Whale occupies oceanic waters beyond the shelfbreak and is a deep diver. A stomach from a stranded Perrin’s Beaked Whale contained two beaks from the squid <em>Octopoteuthis deletron</em>; another contained a single squid eye lens (Mead 1981).</p>","<p>Little specific information is available on anthropogenic threats to Perrin’s Beaked Whale (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>Although there has never been a directed hunt for this species, drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts are known to become entangled and drown&#160; (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009). Entanglement of beaked whales has apparently been eliminated in drift gillnets off California through use of pingers (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, gillnet use without pingers continues off Mexico and even low levels of bycatch could have a significant impact on this apparently rare mesoplodont.<br/><br/>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active mid-frequency sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause of these strandings is often unknown, but some stranded individuals have been found to be suffering from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness linked to disturbance by naval sonar (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). Given that a large fraction of the known distribution of Perrin’s Beaked Whale falls within US Navy testing ranges off California, this could represent the most significant threat to the species.<br/><br/>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality of cetaceans, especially beaked whales, including mesoplodonts (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018).

Regular ship surveys (approximately one every four years) were conducted in the area adjacent to all the known stranding sites for this species, from the coast out to 250-300 nm offshore, from 1991 to 2014, but hardly any of the mesoplodont sightings were identified to species. Pooling the data from these surveys, Barlow (2016) estimated the total abundance of <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. where <em>M. perrini</em> is known to occur as 691 in the southern California stratum and 473 in the central California stratum. Strandings from the adjacent coastline suggest that at least six species of <em>Mesoplodon</em> could be included in these estimates:&#160;<em>M. carlhubbsi</em>, <em>M. perrini</em>, <em>M. peruvianus</em>, <em>M. densirostris</em>, <em>M. stejnegeri</em>, and <em>M. ginkgodens.</em> <em>Mesoplodon perrini </em>is the only species in this group that has not been recorded outside of the survey area. Therefore, the pooled estimate from these two strata (1,164, CV=0.49) provides an upper bound for the abundance of <em>M. perrini</em>.<br/><br/>An analysis of the abundance trend from 1991 to 2014 for <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. in the entire survey area off the entire US west coast (between Canadian and Mexican border) yielded wide confidence limits (95% CRI -10 to +18% p.a.; Moore and Barlow 2017), with too few sightings to estimate the trend by stratum. Previously, Moore and Barlow (2013) had estimated, using data from 1991 to 2008, a trend of -8.4% p.a. (95% CRI -18.9 to +0.3% p.a.) and thus an almost certain decline. However, 2014 was an anomalously warm-water year (<em>e.g</em>. Bond <em>et al</em>. 2015), with many warm-water marine species being recorded far north of their usual ranges, including <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. peruvianus</em>. Moore and Barlow (2017) hypothesize that the apparent increase in the abundance of <em>Mesoplodon</em> species in 2014 was likely caused by a shift in distribution of warmer-water species, <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. peruvianus</em> which are also more common than the displaced <em>M. carlhubbsi</em> and <em>M. stejnegeri,</em> into the area rather than a real population increase. Therefore, the long-term trend of <em>M. perrini</em> cannot be quantified at this time, but a probable continuing decline is inferred from the threats documented below.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The six specimens currently known to science all stranded between southern and central California (33–37°N). These are the five records reported by Dalebout <em>et al.</em> (2002) from southern California, and a stranding that occurred in Monterey, California in 1997. See the Supplementary Information for a map showing stranding locations. It appears that this species is endemic to the eastern North Pacific Ocean off the California coast in warm-temperate waters and probably south into Mexican waters. Initially, two sightings of mesoplodonts off California in the 1970s were tentatively identified as <em>M. hectori</em> (Mead 1981); it was later suggested that these were <em>M. perrini</em> (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2002), but there is no confirming evidence for either identification.<br/><br/>Acoustic data may provide additional information on the geographic range of <em>M. perrini.</em> A unique beaked whale echolocation pulse (called BW43) has been described from seafloor recording instruments off southern and central California up to 350 nmi offshore (Baumann-Pickering <em>et al.</em> 2014). Based on the restricted range of this sound which, at that time, did not extend beyond the suspected range of <em>M. perrini</em>, Baumann-Pickering <em>et al</em>. (2014) proposed that <em>M. perrini</em> was the most likely source of that sound. More recently, a study with drifting buoy recorders found a concentration of BW43 echolocation pulses off northern Baja California, Mexico (Simonis <em>et al.</em>, 2020). If the association between BW43 and <em>M. perrini</em> can be validated, the distribution of this species will be extended south to 29°N.<br/><br/>Given that this species is known only from a small number of strandings, its distribution can only be inferred; the distribution map displayed for this species is based on that produced by Macleod <em>et al.</em> (2006) and is the best available estimate of Perrin's Beaked Whale expected distribution.&#160; The map is coded as 'Incomplete', and the distribution coded as 'Possibly Extant' to reflect the lack of knowledge regarding Perrin's Beaked Whale distribution.&#160;&#160;</p>",,Marine,The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

50662095,18148,Prionailurus planiceps,Endangered,C1,2015,2014-05-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Flat-headed Cat has a restricted and patchy distribution around wetlands in lowland forest on the islands of Sumatra, Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula. It was formerly also distributed in southern Thailand but the last confirmed observation was almost 20 years ago (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010). Current status distribution is limited to presence data, and there are few records in comparison with sympatric small felids. The extent to which this reflects patterns of survey design and effort rather than patterns of distribution is unclear. Wetland destruction and degradation and the very high deforestation rate in southeast Asia is the primary threat faced by the species (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010). Since 2010 there have been few new photo captures of this species with camera traps. The reason for this can be due to the special wetland-based ecology of the species, but as they have been previously photographed on main roads, as well as in the forest and along trails, it is believed unlikely to be the sole reason. It was photographed only a few times in the Kinabatangan area of Sabah, of Borneo (an area thought to have the best habitat for the species), despite hundreds of camera traps (A. Hearn pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Over 45% of protected wetlands and 94% of globally significant wetlands in Southeast Asia are considered threatened (Dugan 1993) and although the situation today is unknown, it is unlikely to be radically better and may be much worse. Causes include human settlement, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid. While there have been observations of the Flat-headed Cat in secondary forests (Bezuijen 2000, Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mohamed <em>et al</em>. 2009), Wilting <em>et al</em>. (2010) could not find any support that the Flat-headed Cat can also live in oil palm plantations. According to their distribution model, over 70% of its predicted historical suitable habitat has been transformed to unsuitable habitats (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010). Between 2000-2010 the Flat-headed Cat lost over 20% of potentially suitable habitat (10% in Peninsular Malaysia, 17% in Borneo and 41% in Sumatra; extracted from Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011). Based on these rates of habitat loss and together with other threats such as pollution of wetlands and hunting it is very likely that the Flat-headed Cat population declined by at least 20% in the last 12 years (two generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) and will also continue to decline over the next 12 years by more than 20%.<br/><br/>It is difficult to estimate population size given its patchy distribution and lack of any density estimates. However the low number of camera-trapping records and direct sightings compared to other Southeast Asian cat species seem to support the notion that the Flat-headed Cat is very rare and/or very specialized in its habitat requirements. An area of occupancy map predicted a species distribution area of about 61,000 km² for Borneo (Wilting <em>et al</em>. unpublished data of the Borneo Carnivore Symposium). For Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra we inferred that additional 10,000 km² and 8,100 km², respectively, could be occupied. If we take a density of four individuals per 100 km² within this 80,000 km², and assuming that not all individuals of a population are mature individuals we would infer a population size which is plausibly fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. For the Flat-headed Cat with its very patchy distribution and its close associations to water resources the average density of four individuals per 100 km² is rather conservative, although in some well suitable areas the density might also be much higher than this. Using a higher average density (&gt;5 mature individulas per 100 km²) would lead to population estimates which would qualify the species as Vulnerable (C1). The IUCN Red List Guidelines (vers. 11, Feb 2014) caution that multiplying density times area extent often leads to “gross overestimation” of the number of mature individuals. Although density estimations of Flat-headed Cats would be needed to verify the inferred numbers, the great threat to Southeast Asian wetlands further supports the classification as Endangered under the precautionary principle.<a name=""_GoBack""></a>","Very little is known about this species, and the available information suggest that, like its close relative the fishing cat, the Flat-headed Cat is strongly associated with wetlands and preys primarily on fish. Stomach contents of two dead animals contained mostly fish, and also shrimp shells. They may also take birds and small rodents, and have been reported to prey on domestic poultry (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/> <br/> Most records for the Flat-headed Cat are from swampy areas, lakes and streams, and riverine forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yasuda <em>et al.</em> 2007). They also occur in peat-swamp forest (Bezuijen 2000), and have been observed in secondary forest (Bezuijen 2000, Bezuijen 2003, Meijaard <em>et al.</em> 2005, Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2009). All published observations of live animals have taken place at night or early morning, near water (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Bezuijen 2000, Bezuijen 2003, Meijaard <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yasuda <em>et al.</em> 2007). Over 80% of the records gathered by Wilting <em>et al.</em> (2010) were from elevations below 100 m asl, and over 70 % were recorded within a distance of three km to larger water sources. <br/> <br/> The Flat-headed Cat takes its name from its unusually long, sloping snout and flattened skull roof, with small ears set well down the sides of its head. It has large, close-set eyes, and relatively longer and sharper teeth than its close relatives. Its claws do not fully retract into their shortened sheaths, and its toes are more completely webbed than the Fishing Cat's, with long narrow foot pads. Muul and Lim (1970), commenting on the cat's feet and other features, termed it the ecological counterpart of a semi-aquatic mustelid.","<p></p><p>Wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation is the primary threat faced by the species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010). Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid in Tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments and is likely to be a significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat (Wilting <em>et al. </em>2010). Trapping, snaring and poisoning are also threats: E. Bennett (in Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) reported that skins were frequently seen in longhouses in the interior of Sarawak, and the Flat-headed Cat has been captured in traps set out to protect domestic fowl (Nowell and Jackson 1996).</p>","<p></p><p>The Flat-headed Cat is closely associated with wetlands and lowland forests, habitats which are increasingly being occupied and modified by people (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010). It has never been studied, there are few records of the species, and it is generally considered rare, with a highly localized distribution around bodies of water (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Anonymous 1996, Bezuijen 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Meijaard <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yasuda <em>et al.</em> 2007, Barita and Boeadi pers. comm. 2006, Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2009). Although fishermen along the Merang River in south Sumatra (which has relatively intact peat forests) described it as common (Bezuijen 2000), they tend to use a single generic term for both Flat-headed Cat and Leopard Cat <em>Prionailurus bengalensis</em>, a more abundant species (Bezuijen 2003). Most of the recent records come from Sabah in northeastern Borneo, where it can be frequently be observed along the Kinabatangan River (Wilting <em>et al.</em> 2010), and where it has been several times recorded by camera-traps in Deramakot and Tangkulap Forest Reserve (Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2009). Recently camera-trapping records come from a mixed-used plantation area, which includes conservation reserves within the oil palm estates in East Kalimantan (Wahyudi and Struebing 2013) and from Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia (Wadey <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"The Flat-headed Cat has a restricted distribution, found only on Sumatra, Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula (Malaysia and extreme southern Thailand).

50662615,18150,Prionailurus viverrinus,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2016-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Recent surveys suggest that Fishing Cat populations are still in decline within all range countries at an alarming rate, particularly in Southeast Asia. A severe paucity of recent records in Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Java, and, if the species occurs there at all, Lao PDR, indicate that these populations are very small, and have been since at least 2000. There are no recent records from Sumatra (Indonesia), where the species has never been confirmed to occur, although in the light of only limited appropriate survey effort in these areas, the species’s current status should be considered unknown. In South Asia, although relatively widespread, it occurs largely in human-dominated landscapes (often hugely so), which are under locally severe threat from urbanization (Sri Lanka and India) and industrialization (India). Estimates of population size and trend, and of extents of habitat, are very speculative, given that research on this species has been initiated only in 2009 (Cutter 2015). Yet, research reveals a declining population facing an array of severe threats from habitat destruction to active persecution due to perceived conflict (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Cutter 2015, Adhya 2016). Poaching and retribution killing were the major causes for a high Fishing Cat mortality of 84% in Thailand, where 16 individuals have been monitored over a three-year radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015). <br/><br/>The current known global Fishing Cat strongholds are Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Bengal in India and the Terai-Duar belt of the Himalayan foothills in India and Nepal. Habitat loss along with the killing of Fishing Cats because of conflict with local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside these strongholds, declines may be considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal are likely in the next 15 years (Ashan Thudugala, Anya Ratnayaka, Tiasa Adhya, Shomita Mukherjee, Murthy Kantimahanti, Giridhar Malla, Rama Mishra, Sagar Dahal pers. comm. 2015). These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a decrease of a further 30% in the global Fishing Cat population. Thus, the species is categorized as Vulnerable under A2cd+3cd+4cd. <br/><br/>The change in Red List category is a non-genuine change reflecting the very recent increase in information quality; it does not indicate an improved conservation status for the species since the last assessment.","In India the Fishing Cat is strongly associated with water bodies, marshlands constituting tall bed-forming graminoid species like the reed <em>Phragmites vallatoria</em>, the reedmace <em>Typha elephantina</em> and locally cultivated grass species like <em>Saccharum narenga</em> and swamps (Adhya 2015). Most known records are from the lowlands, but in Sri Lanka Fishing Cat occurs also in wetlands in hilly areas (Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is largely nocturnal (Mukherjee 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). It is a dietary generalist consuming a variety of prey such as murid rodents, birds and fish (Mukherjee 1989, Haque and Vijayan 1993, Adhya 2015). Two species of rodents that figured prominently in the diet of the Fishing Cat from the Howrah district of West Bengal, a rapidly developing urbanised zone, were <em>Rattus rattus</em> (sensu lato) and <em>Bandicota bengalensis</em>. A conservative estimate of rodent consumption by the Fishing Cat suggests that each individual eats between 365 and 730 rodents per year (Adhya 2015).<br/><br/>A radio-telemetry study on four Fishing Cats in Chitwan National Park in Nepal showed that they mostly used dense tall and short grasslands; the home ranges of three females was estimated at 4-6 km² while that of a single male was estimated at 16-22 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A more recent radio-telemetry study in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, demonstrated that protection of resources such as food and daytime resting sites and reduction of poaching can ensure the persistence of the Fishing Cat in human-modified agricultural areas (Cutter and Cutter 2009). A 84% mortality of radio-collared cats, due to poaching and unknown causes, was reported during the three-year study (Cutter 2015).<br/><br/>Generation Length (GL) was estimated at 5 years, using the Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) formula, GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], [where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3]; Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR), assuming 12 years as the average life span of the Fishing Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year.","The Fishing Cat faces a high risk of extinction throughout its range and is thought to be amongst the most vulnerable of the small and medium-sized cats in Southeast Asia, reflecting the very low overlap of occupied habitat with protected areas and other conservation interventions, rather than any particular inherent higher susceptibility than shown by the other small cats (e.g. Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The major threat across its South Asian range appears to be habitat loss and fragmentation by developmental activities such as urbanization, industrialization, agriculture and aquaculture (prawn and shrimp farms), whereas in Southeast Asia persecution is the major threat (Melisch <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Willcox <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, Cutter (2015) reported 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats during the study period. Of 16 Fishing Cats that were radio-collared, three could not be located and could have either dispersed or died. Of the remaining 13, only two survived the almost three-year study period while five were poached and six died of unknown causes. Five dead cats were located. In one case the poacher who shot an animal reported the cause of death when he returned its ear tag. &#160;<br/><br/>In India, much of its habitat comprises freshwater marshlands which are categorised as ‘wastelands’ under land use policies and are thus subject to conversion and degradation (Adhya 2015). Linked to this is conflict with humans, which is believed to be aggravated by habitat fragmentation and sharing of resources such as space (wetlands) and food (fish, goats, poultry) (Melisch <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Kolipaka 2006, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). Poisoning, trapping and clubbing seem to be common methods to kill Fishing Cats across the species’ range. A survey in West Bengal recorded 27 deaths of Fishing Cats between April 2010 and May 2011 in that year in the Howrah district (1,600 km²) (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In Bangladesh, a compilation of reports from newspaper articles and web-based searches on the Fishing Cat (deaths, captures, rescues and releases) revealed 82 records and 30 confirmed deaths over a three-year period from January 2010 to March 2013 (Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In both areas, almost all deaths could be traced to local people killing the cats (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). It should be taken as the minimum number killed because not all instances are recorded. In the Sundarbans of India, local people from Sagar Island admitted to having exterminated the cat from their island (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2015) noted that in Bangladesh and India more than 70% of the deaths occurred during the dry season, perhaps when Fishing Cat and human resources overlap maximally. A recent study (Adhya 2015) in the Howrah district of West Bengal reveals that Fishing Cat diet is largely composed of small mammals, fish and birds with a negligible portion (less than 5%) comprising of livestock and surmises that the killings are based on a perception of conflict because of the presence of the cat.<br/><br/>In Cambodia the Fishing Cat is killed by locals for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Such killings probably occur throughout its Southeast Asian range.","Fishing Cat populations and habitat in Southeast Asia are severely stressed and the species’ current stronghold is in eastern and southern parts of South Asia. According to Melisch <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1996), in West Java, Fishing Cat populations were fragmented and restricted to coastal areas. However, this was in the 1990s and the evidence was based solely on visual identification of tracks and scats, which may not be reliable; the last photographic evidence of the species in the wild on Java dates to 2000 (A. Compost <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2012). The Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016). It is unclear the extent, if any, to which these surveys covered microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat. In sum, it is impossible to speculate on current population size in Java, if the species even survives there at all. In Viet Nam the species is perhaps extinct in most or even all of its former range but it was confirmed to persist in the Mekong Delta until at least 2000 (Willcox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). It is not known if it ever occurred in the Red River Delta; given general levels of hunting and persecution in the country it seems unlikely that any large population remains anywhere in Viet Nam (Daniel Willcox <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). <br/><br/>In Thailand too, the species seems to be highly localised and recent surveys and incidental records suggest that it is restricted to coastal parts of Central and Southern Thailand (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Buatip <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Tantipisanuh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). There is at least one historical Thai specimen identified as this species from well inland (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010), but the extent to which the species ever occurred widely across inland Thailand, if at all, remains unclear. Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, coastal Thailand, (Cutter 2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats due to poaching and unknown causes over her three-year study period.<br/><br/>Its presence in the Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar was recently confirmed (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2016), but there is no indication of the population size there, although given the extent of the habitat it could be large. <br/><br/>Extensive camera-trapping in the general area of the only historical locality record from Myanmar, the Hukaung Valley, did not find the species, but camera-traps were not set to target this species, so it is unclear whether it persists there (Than Zaw <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South Asia, the Fishing Cat is currently widespread in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The Pakistan population of Fishing Cat was feared to be close to extinction (Roberts 1977), but there are camera-trap records of Fishing Cat from the Chotiari Reservoir in the Sindh Province of Pakistan (Islam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015) and recent reports of individuals being sold in local markets in Karachi (Faraz Zubairi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). In Sri Lanka and in India there are small populations of Fishing Cat in densely human-populated urban areas (Adhya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Ratnayaka 2016). In Nepal it occurs along a narrow stretch bounding India, in the Terai region (Sagar Dahal <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). It seems to be relatively safe in some protected areas in India, especially those under the Project Tiger scheme, such as Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, at the Indo-Nepal border and the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve bordering Bangladesh. In Bangladesh the Fishing Cat seems to be relatively safe in mangrove forests of the Sundarbans and in the north-eastern swamps (Rahman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). However, on both sides of the India-Bangladesh border, very few surveys have been undertaken to assess the status and distribution of the Fishing Cat across the salinity gradient of the mangrove region.<br/><br/>A molecular analysis of population connectivity in India suggested that in the past Fishing Cat populations within India were connected from the Terai region of the Himalayan foothills to the Coringa mangroves in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). However, this analysis was restricted to the mitochondrial genome and is not comprehensive. Several small pockets of populations survive across the eastern coast and eastern states of India, and many are perhaps yet to be discovered (Adhya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Murthy Kantimahanti and Giridhar Malla <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). Similarly, in the western semi-arid part of India a recent record in Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (Sadhu and Reddy 2013) and protected wetlands in the areas neighbouring Rajasthan such as Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary near Agra (Baiju Raj <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) suggest that populations either exist in pockets or are long-distance dispersers tracking suitable habitats. Extensive surveys are required to clarify this. Fishing Cat was thought to be extinct in Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Rajasthan, by 2007 (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but a later survey recorded an individual, and though numbers may be drastically reduced, some individuals may still persist there (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Abrar Khan pers. comm. 2011). North-eastern India is another region where the species is recorded from pockets e.g. Manas (Qamar Qureshi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) and Kaziranga Tiger Reserves (Qamar Qureshi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) in Assam and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2003, Aparajita Dutta <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2012). Though there have been several camera-trap surveys in this region targeting Tiger, these may not have adequately covered the habitat of Fishing Cat. Focussed surveys along the several river courses in the region are required to gauge population connectivity and status of Fishing Cat.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and destruction along with the killing of Fishing Cats by local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more, in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside the strongholds, declines may have been considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue currently, and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal and 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta are likely in the next 15 years. These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a drop of a further 30% in the global population.",Decreasing,"The natural distribution of the Fishing Cat is unclear throughout its global range, with many unauthenticated, ambiguous and erroneous records clouding understanding (Pocock 1939, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016, Duckworth 2016, Willcox 2016). In addition the species is not well recorded by typical modern general faunal surveys, meaning that absence of records from areas without specific Fishing Cat surveys should not be taken to imply absence of the species (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010, Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016). Other factors also hinder determination of current range: putative introductions, sporadic records from regions not included in past distribution assessments, persistence in small pockets but with drastically reduced numbers and potentially amid areas of widespread extirpation, and possible recent extinctions through much of its range (Adhya <em>et al.</em> 2011, Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014, Adhya 2016, Duckworth 2016, Kantimahanti 2016, Mukherjee 2016, Willcox 2016). &#160;<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia from Pakistan in the west to Cambodia in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to Sri Lanka and peninsular Thailand in the south. Its distribution was probably always patchy because of its strong association with wetlands. Current known occurrence is extremely localized across the range except for West Bengal in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.&#160; Results of a molecular analysis of Fishing Cat faeces from five protected areas in India indicated that in the past Fishing Cat populations were connected from the Terai in northern India to the Coringa mangroves on India's east coast; it is unknown whether contemporary populations are still connected physically (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mukherjee 2016). Also unknown is whether population units in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion at the base of the Himalayas are connected outside protected areas or along river courses.<br/><br/>More recently, the species has been recorded in areas where it was never observed before, such as in southern Andhra Pradesh, India, and in the far south of coastal Thailand. It had presumably been overlooked in these areas previously; they are unlikely to indicate recent range extension. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia its occurrence is likely to be extremely patchy in Viet Nam, Lao PDR (if it occurs there at all), Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Java, Indonesia.<br/><br/>Detailed country-wise distributions are provided below:<br/><br/>Pakistan: this population was thought to be close to extinction in the early 1970s (Roberts 1977), but Islam <em>et al.</em> (2015) camera-trapped individuals in the Chotiari Reservoir area in the Sanghar District of Sindh Province. There are also reports of individuals being sold and seized in a wildlife market in Karachi (Bhatti 2015, Faraz Ubairi <em>in litt.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Nepal: intensive camera trapping surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> monitoring since 2008 corroborated the Fishing Cat's presence in Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the far western Terai, but failed to record it in Bardia National Park (Babu Ram Lamichhane and Shailendra Yadav pers. comm. 2016). It is present in and around Jagadishpur Reservoir, a Ramsar site in south-western Nepal (Dahal <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in Chitwan National Park in the central Terai (Dahal and Dahal 2011, Mishra 2016). In south-eastern Nepal, it has been recorded in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (Pandey <em>et al.</em> 2012, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sagar Dahal and Angie Appel <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Whether these populations are connected outside protected areas remains unknown.<br/><br/>India: protected areas hosting Fishing Cat populations include Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Baiju Raj <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Corbett Tiger Reserve, Uttarakhand (Abishek Harihar <em>in litt.</em> 2012), Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in West Bengal (Yadavendradev Jhala <em>in litt.</em> 2015), Keoladeo Ghana National Park (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012) and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan (Sadhu and Reddy 2013), Kaziranga Karbi Anglong Landscape (Jimmy Borah <em>in litt.</em> 2012) and Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam (Qamar Qureshi <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar (Qamar Qureshi <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Malla and Sivakumar 2014) and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Aparajita Datta <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Outside protected areas, records exist from Pilibhit Forest Division in Uttar Pradesh (Meraj Anwar <em>in litt.</em> 2011), in small wetland patches in West Bengal near Kolkata and its suburbs like the Howrah and Hooghly districts (Anonymous 1989, Adhya <em>et al.</em> 2011), in Medinipur and Nadia districts and in the human-dominated north-eastern part of Chilika Lake and Tangi district in Odisha (Tiasa Adhya <em>in litt.</em> 2016). The Fishing Cat has also been recorded recently in areas lacking historical records viz. the Krishna River mangroves in Andhra Pradesh (Kantimahanti 2016). There are also historical statements of occurrence in the Western Ghats and the western coast of India (Pocock 1939), which have not been confirmed by recent targeted searches and may have been in error (Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In the Duars of north-eastern India, superficially suitable habitat may extend into Bhutan, but a number of general surveys there have not recorded the species (e.g. Tempa <em>et al.</em> 2013, Banerjee and Bandopadhyay 2016).<br/><br/>Sri Lanka: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas along the coast and in the island's interior (Andrew Kittle <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Individuals have also been recorded in densely human-populated urban areas of Colombo and outside protected areas in Kandy, Mathle and Nuwaraeliya districts (Ratnayaka 2016, Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>Bangladesh: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas of the Sundarbans (Rahman 2016, Adam Barlow pers. comm. 2016), in unprotected wetlands in the Brahmaputra river basin (Rahman and McCarthy 2014, Chowdhury <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in the Chittagong hill tracts (Chakma 2015, Karim and Ahsan 2016). However, Chakma (2015) obtained only three potential records of which two were pugmarks and one was a video from a camera-trap which was not authenticated as Fishing Cat and could have been a Leopard Cat P. bengalensis.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, there are only two certain field records: one from the early 20th century in the Hukaung Valley in the north, and one from Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary in the Ayeyarwady (= Irrawaddy) delta in or around 2015 (Than Zaw <em>in litt.</em> 2016). This corroborates reports that a few captive individuals in the country are said to be descendants of animals captured in or around the 1990s in the Ayeyarwady delta (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Thailand: during targeted surveys Fishing Cat was recorded inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park and Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area along the coast, but not in protected areas farther inland that were previously thought to harbour Fishing Cat (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh <em>et al.</em> 2014). An incidental record came from the coast in southern Thailand (Buatip <em>et al.</em> 2013; confirmed by photograph examined by J.W. Duckworth and W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2016), which constitutes the southernmost valid record with a precise locality to date in mainland Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Cambodia: camera-trap records are scarce and limited to Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in the country's north-east (Rainey and Kong 2010), and mangrove habitats in Peam Krasaop Wildlife Sanctuary and Ream National Park on the coast (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Despite extensive camera-trapping in eastern and northern Cambodia including Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in recent years, Fishing Cat was not recorded. (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2012, Simon Mahood pers. comm. 2016). A kitten found orphaned in Botum-Sakor National Park was identified as Fishing Cat, but may have been a Leopard Cat (Royan 2009). Of many other claims in the last 15 years, most are certainly in error, but a critical evaluation of all has not been performed.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR most claims are either in certain error or non-assessable; only one sounds credible but this is a sight-record that cannot be validated (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Viet Nam: Fishing Cat may persist in the Mekong Delta, where it was last camera-trapped in 2000 (Willcox 2016). There is a very small possibility that it occurs in the Red River Delta (where it has never been confirmed), though there have been no targeted surveys to be confident of genuine absence or local extinction (Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Indonesia: it is known to have occurred only along the west and north coast of Java within 15 km of the coast (Sody 1936, Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996), but there are no records of wild-living individuals since 2000. The inferences of Melisch <em>et al.</em> (1996) are based on a single track and some scats, neither of which can be treated as conclusive evidence. Alain Compost photographed Fishing Cats in Java in the 1990s and suggested that some may still survive in the Banten Bay region and in Ujung Kulon National Park (Alain Compost <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Until 2000, he photographed Fishing Cats in Pulau Dua Bird Sanctuary, a protected mangrove forest on the northern coast, but learned of all Fishing Cats been poisoned there by 2006 (Alain Compost <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros sondaicus</em> in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson <em>in litt.</em> 2016); the overlap, if any, of camera-trap stations with microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat is not known.<br/><br/>There is no certain record from Sumatra, but historical testimony from a hunter who was familiar with the species from Java, and a captive individual in the 2000s in a local zoo indicate that the species might inhabit the island (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, contra Sanderson 2009).<br/><br/>Occurrence in Peninsular Malaysia is also open to doubt (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009), but the Thai locality record in Buatip <em>et al.</em> (2013) is very close to the Malaysian border. Past claims for Borneo, Taiwan and China lack any credible basis (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Jutzeler <em>et al.</em> 2010). <br/><br/>The species is known from sea level in parts of its range, and in the northern parts it is likely to occur only in the lowlands. Recent reliable elevation records in the Terai of India and Nepal are all from below 150 m, such as Pilibhit Forest Division and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (Meraj Anwar <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Jagadishpur Reservoir area, Chitwan National Park (Dahal <em>et al.</em> 2015, Dahal and Dahal 2012) and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve area (Angie Appel <em>in litt.</em> 2016), except one at 330 m on the southern edge of Corbett Tiger Reserve (Abishek Harihar <em>in litt.</em> 2012). However, Pocock (1939) accepted a Fishing Cat skin from Barkot near Dehra Dun on the banks of the upper Yamuna river as evidence of at least occasional high-altitude occurrence at about 5,000 ft (ca. 1,500 m), but did not explain whether this individual was killed there, or whether there was any possibility that, while a skin had been procured at that altitude, the animal had originated elsewhere. In Sri Lanka, Fishing Cat has been recorded at elevations up to 1,800 m (Ashan Thudugala <em>in litt.</em> 2016). However, the Sri Lankan altitudinal range seems to be an exception as all other authentic locality records are much lower than that.","The Fishing Cat is killed for consumption and a very recent report from Howrah district, India, reveals the rampant killing of the species outside protected areas in human-dominated landscapes for consumption as part of a cultural practice. Such cases most often go unnoticed or are ignored unless some interested people and non-governmental organisations pursue the case until the perpetrators are convicted (Adhya 2015). In Cambodia, the Fishing Cat is killed by local people for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). In Thailand a radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015) demonstrated that poaching is a major threat when five of 16 radio-collared individuals were killed by poachers (for consumption and retaliation) within the three-year study period. Cutter (2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared individuals attributed to poaching and unknown causes. Opportunistic trading of skins and potentially other parts is likely to occur in mainland Southeast Asia, where such trading is at very high levels and involves a wide diversity of species (e.g. Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014), but there is no evidence of its being particularly sought after there. Similarly, in Java individuals are sometimes seen in the island’s intensive live animal (‘pet’) trade (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009), but again there is no indication that it is (yet) a specific target.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Fishing Cat is included in CITES Appendix II and protected by national legislation over most of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam Fishing Cat has the highest level of protection under the main species protection law (decree 32/2006/ND-CP) and is included in appendix I B. This completely prohibits any exploitation or commercial trade. There is no protection afforded outside protected areas in Nepal (Karan B. Shah, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Since 1985, the Fishing Cat has been confirmed to occur in protected areas (but it should not be assumed necessarily to survive in all) including the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and India; Suklaphanta, Chitwan and Koshi Tappu in Nepal; Corbett, Dudwha, Keoladeo Ghana, Coringa and Kaziranga in India; Yala, Wilpattu, Maduru Oya, Horton Plains, Dunumadallawa, Kalametiya, Sinharaja, Bundala and Uda Walawe in Sri Lanka; Khao Sam Roi Yot and Thale Noi in Thailand; Kulen Promtep, Peam Krasaop and Ream in Cambodia. Several wetlands that hold Fishing Cat populations are listed under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of important wetlands, e.g. Sundarbans in Bangladesh, Chilika Lake, Keoladeo Ghana and East Kolkata Wetlands in India, Jagadishpur Reservoir in Nepal and Chotiari Reservoir in Pakistan.<br/><br/>The survival of the species depends on adequate protection of remaining wetlands in Asia, and prevention of indiscriminate trapping, snaring and poisoning.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It requires deep-water lakes (both natural and artificial canals) with abundant aquatic vegetation, and is sensitive to changes in water quality.&#160;Structures such as plants are needed to lay eggs. It is a paedomorphic species, living permanently in water, and does not undergo complete metamorphosis. It is thought to reach maturity around 1.5 years and, in captivity, lives until about 10 years; the generation length is estimated to be around 5.5 years.","Xochimilco is a complex water system of <em>c</em>. 40 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of artificial channels, small lakes and temporary wetlands between rural and urban areas (Zambrano&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). The desiccation and pollution of the canal system and lakes in Xochimilco and Chalco, as a result of urbanization and increased tourist activity is the primary threat to the species (Zambrano 2006). Although the water regime has changed in the last ten years, and it is reported that pollution levels are decreasing, factors such as very high levels of bacterial contamination could still pose a serious threat.<br/><br/>The species was previously also captured for the international pet trade, however, it is thought that all animals in the international trade are now captive bred. Traditional consumption of the species by local people is presumed to have ceased, but may have presented a threat to the species in the past. Introduced fishes (tilapia and carp) have increased to high abundances (a recent study collected 600 kg of tilapia in one small channel using a 100 m net) and have also impacted the species through competition and predation.&#160;<br/><br/>The species has tested positive to the amphibian chytrid fungus&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;(<em>Bd</em>), but is not thought to be susceptible to the disease (Garcia-Feria <em>et al</em>. 2017). In addition, laboratory tests have shown that the species is resistant to the salamander chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em> (<em>Bsal</em>) (M. Gray pers. comm. 2019).","The population has experienced a dramatic reduction due to habitat transformation (Zambrano&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007) and the surviving wild population is very small. Although subpopulations are difficult to assess, surveys covering almost all of its known distribution range have usually captured fewer than 100 individuals (e.g. during 2002 and 2003, more than 1,800 net casts were made along Xochimilco canals covering 39,173 m² which resulted in a catch of only 42 specimens; and only two individuals were captured in 2013). In a study covering a span of six years (from 1998 to 2004), the species' density had reduced from 0.006-org/ m<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 0.001-org/ m<sup>2</sup>, although it is thought that this reduction could also be due to its own population dynamics (Zambrano 2006).&#160;Previous population density estimates for this species have been reportedly low, but alarming declines have been observed: from 6,000 ind/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;estimated in 1998 to 1000 in 2004 (Zambrano&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007) to 100 in 2008 (unpubl. data in Contreras&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Local fishermen have also reported very few individuals in 2008 (Contreras&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009).<br/><br/>There has not been a density study of the Chalco subpopulation, but evidence suggests that it is small and, furthermore, Chalco is a highly unstable system that runs the risk of disappearing in the near future.&#160;Re-population has been attempted by introducing close to 10,000 individuals in 2012. Ecological niche modelling indicates that the species' potential distribution in Xochimilco is limited to 11 sites in six reduced, isolated and scattered areas, located mostly in zones dominated by traditional agricultural&#160;(Contreras&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). However, monthly sampling at Xochimilco over the course of 2017 did not record the species (L. Zambrano pers. comm. 2017).

The species is a habitat generalist, and is sometimes targeted for use in the aquarium trade. It is also caught in substantial numbers as bycatch and subsequently traded for use in traditional medicines and as curios. Based on local trade surveys and international trade data reported to CITES, the trade in this species has accelerated since the late 1990s. Combined with habitat loss and degradation throughout the region, it is suspected that past and ongoing declines of at least 30% may increase this species' risk of extinction. Therefore <em>Hippocampus algiricus</em> is listed as Vulnerable under the criterion A4cd.","<em>Hippocampus algiricus </em>inhabits shallow coastal areas with silt, mud, gravel, sand, seagrass, or macroalgae (Lourie 2016). This species has also been found clinging to large sponges and rhodoliths (Wirtz <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). They are usually found in the shallow photic zone up to a depth of 25 m (Wirtz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). <br/><br/>Little is known about feeding, but this species likely consumes small benthic and/or planktonic crustaceans such as harpacticoid and cyclopoid copepods, gammarid shrimps, and mysids (Woods<em> et al.</em> 2002, Kendrick and Hyndes 2005, Kitsos <em>et al. </em>2008, Yip<em> et al. </em>2015, Valladares <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; <br/><br/>Like all seahorses, they are ovovivparous and females transfer eggs to the male’s brood pouch where the embryos are nurtured prior to live birth (Foster and Vincent 2004). All seahorse species also have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (e.g., Perante <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002), highly structured social behaviour (e.g., Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999). <br/><br/>Size at maturity is roughly 9 cm (at 16.1 cm 50% of individuals were mature), with a maximum size recorded for the species of 22 cm (Cisneros-Montemayor <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Habitat degradation along the coast is also a concern for this shallow-intertidal species. There is a history of marine contamination from heavy metals, pesticides, oil, and human wastes, as well as coastal development and intensive fishing (Portmann 1989), which may affect populations of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. algiricus</span>.<br/><br/>Shrimp trawling, with high levels of by-catch and ever-increasing demand, occurs extensively along the coast of West Africa in the same habitats as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. algiricus </span>(Kristjonsson 1968, Blaber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000, FAO 2001). It is known that trawling catches large numbers of seahorses as bycatch when populations of seahorses are present in trawling areas (Baum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, McPherson and Vincent 2004, Giles <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Perry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Bycatch of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. algiricus</span> occurs in West Africa (Cisneros-Montemayor <em>et al.</em> 2016), likely to the detriment of this population.&#160;Fishing pressure from artisanal fishers has also increased dramatically in recent years and this, coupled with little enforcement of minimum mesh sizes for shrimp trawling in countries such as Guinea, is putting heavy pressures on local seahorse populations (K.West pers. comm. 2012, Cisneros-Montemayor <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Population declines are suspected as a result of habitat degradation, coastal development (Portmann 1989), and mortality from intense trawling bycatch, which occurs throughout this species’ range (Kristjonsson 1968, Portmann, 1989, FAO 2001, Cisneros-Montemayor <em>et al.</em> 2016), and large volumes of documented international trade (Evanson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012).<br/><br/><em>Hippocampus algiricus</em>&#160;has also been selected by the CITES Animals Committee for the Review of Significant Trade following COP15 (CITES 2012).<br/><br/>Overall, it is suspected that a 30% decline of this species within a 10-year window now and into the future is likely.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in the Eastern Central Atlantic ocean off the coast of West Africa, from Senegal to Angola (Alfonso <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Lourie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Mamonekene <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).

The type specimen was located off the coast of Algeria in the 1850s (Kaup 1856), but subsequent research and a lack of any additional specimens from this well-monitored area indicates this sourcing is likely an error. Pending further evidence, the range is considered to exclude the Mediterranean.","Seahorses are traded globally for use in aquairums, as curios, and in traditional medicines (Vincent<em> et al.</em> 2011a). Trade of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hippocampus algiricus</span>&#160;specifically was undocumented in the 1990s (Lourie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004), however, as early as 1996 there has been recorded trade of hundreds of kilograms of seahorses annually from West African countries such as Guinea, Gambia, Senegal and Togo (Vincent <em>et al. </em>2011b)&#160;and since this species is the&#160;only seahorse recorded in some of these areas, it is fair to assume that much of this trade was in <em>H. algiricus</em>. <br/><br/>Between 2004 and 2008, an average of 700,000 individual wild seahorses were traded internationally every year from West Africa (Evanson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012). These seahorses were exported predominantly to Asian countries (UNEP–WCMC 2012), presumably for traditional medicines (Vincent <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a, b).

Recent surveys have begun to uncover this trade and show that pressure on this species has been increasing over the past 10 to 15 years (Cisneros-Montemayor <em>et al.</em> 2016). Guinea and Senegal were reported as sources of 57 and 37% of wild exports of <em>H. algiricus</em> (CITES 2016).

61953525,2059,Arctocephalus philippii,Least Concern,,2015,2014-10-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The present geographic range of the Juan Fernández Fur Seal is likely similar to that prior to exploitation since there are no records of the species using continental islands. Past abundance is also unknown, but given the documented extent of exploitation during most of the 19th century, the population likely would have comprised at least several hundred thousand individuals. The current population is very small by comparison and has a limited range on oceanic islands showing preferences for a particular rocky habitat. The limited breeding space available for the Juan Fernández Fur Seal, with no other oceanic islands nearby that may be colonized in the near future, is of concern. Reduced genetic variability may pose an additional challenge to population recovery. The Juan Fernandez Fur Seal does not meet any of the IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and is therefore listed as Least Concern.<br/><br/><br/><em></em>","The Juan Fernández Fur Seal is a polygynous species. Based on sealer observations made during the late 18th century, the breeding season lasts from mid-November through the end of January, and the colonies are essentially vacated by early September, and no later than mid-October (Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Juan Fernández Fur Seals are sexually dimorphic from the time of birth (Osman <em>et al</em>. 2010) and the differences in length and weight increase with age. Adult males reach 2 m length and weigh 140 kg. Lactating females are on average 1.42 m in length and 48.1 kg in weight (Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998). Newborn pups are approximately 65-68 cm long and weigh 6.2-6.9 kg, and are born with a black coat. Male pups are significantly larger and heavier than female pups at birth, but they do not grow faster than females nor do they show significant differences in body condition. Differences in the growth rates of male and female Juan Fernández Fur Seal pups appear to originate before birth and are not accentuated during the nursing period (Osman <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Males defend territories on land that typically cover about 36 m² and that include an average of four females; some males also hold larger territories in the water (Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998). Most adult females give birth within a few days of arriving at the rookery. Mean time from birth to the first foraging trip is 11.3 days. Although females can be gone for as little as a day, the mean length of foraging trips is 12.3 days, with the longest recorded trip lasting 25 days. Mean duration of pup attendance between foraging trips is 5.3 days with a range of 0.3–15.8 days. Based on the onset of pupping and the observations at vacant colonies in early September, pups appear to be weaned at 7-10 months old (Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Juan Fernández Fur Seal females travel long distances to find adequate quantities of prey making some of the longest foraging trips of any otariid (Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998, Osman 2007). Most trips were made to the southwest and west of the Juan Fernández Islands, far offshore, to deep oceanic areas more than 550 km from the island (mean = 653 km) and up to 889 km distant. The mean dive depth was only 12.3 m and the mean dive duration was 51 seconds, suggesting mostly surface feeding (Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998). Osman (2007) analysed 27,541 dives made by five females from Alejandro Selkirk Island during a single foraging trip, obtaining a median dive depth of 4 m and median dive duration of 0.33 minutes. Maximum depth attained by any seal was 169.5 m during a dive lasting 3.1 minutes and the longest dive lasted 5.1 minutes with a maximum depth of 24 m. The median maximum depths ranged from 3.5 m to 4.5 m (Osman 2007). Francis <em>et al</em>. (1998) reported that nearly all foraging-type dives occur at night; however (Osman 2007) found feeding during daytime to be more frequent.<br/><br/>Juan Fernández Fur Seals feed extensively on vertically-migrating prey (Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998). Their diet is one of the least diverse of any otariid. Coupled with the long foraging trips made by lactating females, this pattern reflects the low productivity of their oceanic feeding areas (Acuña and Francis 1995). The diet composition of Juan Fernández Fur Seals was assessed by analysing 437 scats collected during five reproductive seasons (1987–1991). The study yielded 4,172 fish otoliths and cephalopod beaks, with 13 prey species identified. Myctophidae represented most of the items (80.3%), followed by Scomberesocidae (10%), Carangidae (9.5%), Engraulidae (1.0%), and Bathylagidae (0.7%). Cephalopod families included Onychoteuthidae (27.1%), Ommastrephidae (3.7%), and Tremoctopodidae (0.7%) (Acuña and Francis 1995). Scat samples from females contained larger numbers of the Squid Onychoteuthis banksi than did the samples from subadult males and juveniles.<br/><br/>Two-thirds of the 60 Juan Fernández Fur Seal pups found dead on Alejandro Selkirk Island during the 1991 and 1992 breeding seasons had Hookworms (<em>Uncinaria</em> sp.), with a mean infection of 17 parasites per host (Sepúlveda 1998). Blue Sharks, Great White Sharks, and Killer Whales are suspected predators, and Leopard Seals that infrequently visit the islands may also prey on Juan Fernández Fur Seals (Torres 1987).","Juan Fernández Fur Seals were hunted to the brink of extinction by commercial sealers trading pelts in China. Intensive sealing began in the late 18th century and ended in the late 19th century when few seals could be found. Small numbers were seen in the early 20th century and the species was thought to have gone extinct shortly thereafter. The species was rediscovered in the mid- 20th century, and has since been making a slow comeback.<br/><br/>The limited population size and geographical range, coupled with the fact that the species passed through a genetic bottleneck, makes Juan Fernández Fur Seals vulnerable to catastrophic events and stress from disease outbreaks, oil spills, environmental regime shifts, disturbances, and fisheries. Seals have been sighted with plastic bands and fishing net debris around their necks since 1982 (Torres 1990). During the summers of 2003, 2004, and 2005, about 20 animals were sighted with scars around their necks and heads from entanglement in nets or marine debris. All age and sex categories were represented (Osman <em>et al</em>. 2007, Osman 2007). Mortality rate due to these entanglements is unknown. Pelagic fisheries that usually operate with little regulation may increase the vulnerability of this species, which spends most of its time offshore.<br/><br/>The effects of global climate change on Juan Fernández Fur Seals are uncertain. However, for a species that undertakes such long foraging trips during the pup dependency period any negative disruption of the ecosystem is likely to be a threat.","The number of Juan Fernández Fur Seals harvested between 1793 and 1807 has been estimated to be in the order of millions (Busch 1985, Hubbs and Norris 1971) but no reliable estimates are available. By 1872, approximately 38,000 animals had been killed for the fur trade with China, and during 1801, “a single ship carried one million skins to the London Market” (Bush 1985). By 1891, the Juan Fernández Fur Seal population was estimated to be just 300-400 animals; by 1900 and until the middle of the 20th century the species was presumed extinct (Scheffer 1958, Hubbs and Norris 1971, Gerber and Hilborn 2001). In 1965, the species was rediscovered when small groups of Fur Seals were sighted on Alejandro Selkirk and Robinson Crusoe Islands (Bahamonde 1966, Aguayo 1979). The overall abundance of the Juan Fernández Fur Seal recovered from 750 individuals in 1969 to 32,278 in 2005. On Robinson Crusoe Island, the number of pups increased from 125 in 1983 to 2,732 in 2005. On Santa Clara the number of pups increased from 575 in 1998 to 1,325 in 2005, and on Alejandro Selkirk Island 548 pups were sighted in 1983 while 6,941 were observed in 2005 (Osman 2007).<br/><br/>In 2005, 63% of the total 10,998 pups were born on Alejandro Selkirk Island, which is the only clearly increasing colony (Osman 2007). Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara populations are stable, suggesting that the quality of the breeding habitat may be important to the recovery of this species. Overall, the population is apparently stabilizing, as the per capita population growth rate oscillates between negative and positive values (Osman 2007). The current Juan Fernández Fur Seal population remains small and represents a much reduced fraction of its population prior to the seal exploitation period.<br/><br/>Mitochondrial DNA from 28 Fur Seals from both islands of Juan Fernández was used to evaluate the potential negative effect of the population bottleneck. Contrary to expectations, no significant reduction in genetic variability was identified (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2000). Similar results were obtained for the Guadalupe Fur Seal (Bernardi <em>et al</em>. 1998). However, when the genetic material from recent animals was compared to the genetic material from specimens collected prior to the seal exploitation, significantly reduced genetic variability was evident (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2004).",Increasing,"Juan Fernández Fur Seals inhabit three islands in the Juan Fernández Archipelago (Alejandro Selkirk, Robinson Crusoe, and Santa Clara Islands) as well as the San Félix Islands (San Félix and San Ambrosio), also called “Islas Desventuradas”. The Juan Fernández Islands are located approximately 650 km west of Valparaiso, off the Chilean coast. The San Félix Islands are located approximately 910 km due west of the Bahia Chanaral de Las Animas on the coast of Chile´s Atacama Desert. Almost the entire population resides on the Juan Fernández Archipelago, with very few animals being found on the San Felix Islands (Osman 2007, National Geographic-Oceana 2013). The Robinson Crusoe (47.9 km²) and Alejandro Selkirk (49.5 km²) Islands are the largest and are home to the majority of the population (Osman 2007). The San Félix Islands are much smaller: San Ambrosio measures 2.2 km² while San Félix covers 1.4 km².<br/><br/>In 1990 and 1991, five adult female Juan Fernández Fur Seals from Alejandro Selkirk Island were instrumented with satellite transmitters that indicate they made foraging trips primarily south and west of the archipelago to locations up to 889 km away, with all tracked females at some time located over 550 km from the island (mean = 653 km; Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998). In another study conducted in 2005 (Osman 2007), satellite locations from seven instrumented adult females indicated some animals foraged near the Juan Fernández Archipelago while others travelled as far as 837 km toward the coast of Chile, reaching the continental shelf near Concepción Bay. The mean distance ravelled offshore by female Juan Fernández Fur Seals was 1,394 km. Juan Fernández Fur Seals have been sighted with regularity since 1983 at Punta San Juan, Perú (Majluf and Reyes 1989) which is considered here as the northern limit of their extent of occurrence. However, the northernmost record for the species comes from a vagrant male sighted on the San Francisco beach in Buenaventura Port, Colombia (3°53’N, 77°4’W; Avila <em>et al</em>. 2014). The southern limit is represented by the farthest distance recorded for instrumented animals from Alejandro Selkirk Island approximately 890 km to the southeast (Francis <em>et al</em>. 1998).","Juan Fernández Fur Seals were hunted to the brink of extinction by commercial sealers trading pelts mostly in China.

It is found in rivers in China. It is found at depths ranging from one to at least 20 m. This is a euryhaline species which lives in the bottom layer of inshore and inland waters. Spawning occurs in estuaries, and this species is known to migrate into freshwater to spawn. It is a commercial species which is considered highly-valued, however there is little information available to characterize the fishery. This species has been bred in captivity, and it is unclear whether or not this effort has been for the purposes of stock enhancement. There is little species-specific population information available. This species' dependence on freshwater systems to spawn and its predictable, seasonal mass spawning migrations into freshwater systems render it particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Seasonal fishing prohibitions and the presence of both fresh and marine water preserves in parts of its range may offer this species some protection<em>. Takifugu obscurus</em> is assessed as Least Concern.","<p><em>Takifugu obscurus</em> is a demersal, &#160;anadromous species which undergoes annual seasonal migrations into freshwater systems to spawn. In the Yangtze River basin, the spawning period for <em>T. obscurus</em> is from March until April. This species maintains a sex ratio of approximately 1: 1. This species reaches sexual maturity between 25 and 28 cm (SL). The ovaries and blood are extremely toxic, while the liver, skin, and intestine are highly toxic. The flesh and testes are innocuous (Nakabo 2002).<br/> <br/> This species lives in the bottom layer of inshore and inland waters, and grows 20–40 cm in length. Most of the growth takes place in the sea but they spawn in brackish and fresh water. During the spawning season, which is from late spring to early summer, the sexually mature fish run into river estuaries and spawn in inland waters including rivers, lakes, and ponds. The fingerlings grow in the inland water and either return to the sea the next spring or they there for a few months before returning to the sea. In the sea they grow to sexually mature fish over several years, and then return to the inland water again to spawn (Kato <em>et al.</em> 2005).</p>","There have been no confirmed population declines in&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. obscurus</span>. However, it is likely to be impacted by the following:<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fugu fishery</span><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. obscurus</span>&#160;are unknown, it is likely that populations of this minor commercial species are impacted by this fishery.&#160;<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</span><br/>Fishes of the genus&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span>&#160;have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu&#160;</span>are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Fishes of the genus&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span>&#160;are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span>&#160;species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span>&#160;on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</span><br/>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).",There is little species-specific population information available for wild populations of&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>.,Stable,"In the Western Pacific<em>, Takifugu obscurus</em> is known from the Yellow Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea south to the Korean Peninsula.

Aquacultured Takifugu are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012).&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span>&#160;pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer,&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes</span>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes</span>,&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. snyderi</span>,<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;T. chinensis</span>, and&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. porphyreus</span>. Aquaculture efforts focus on&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes</span>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Seriola quinqueradiata</span>), Red Sea Bream (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pagrus major</span>), coho Salmon (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Oncorhynchus kisutch</span>) and Japanese flounder (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Paralichthys olivaceus</span>). Although highly valuable (the market price of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes</span>&#160;is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<br/><br/>Tiger puffer (<em>T. rubripes</em>) was introduced to China from Japan (Lin and Huang 2007). To meet increasing demand for pufferfish, China began large-scale artificial breeding of pufferfish in the 1990s. An annual output of about 4,000 tonnes of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, which was introduced from Japan to China (Lin and Huang 2007) is exported to Japan and South Korea. Additionally, an annual output of about 6,000 tonnes of&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>&#160;was also produced for export in China. Pufferfishes are still landed in China, mostly in Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other places. Nationwide, the total output of pufferfish is now around 20,000 t per year (Ma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011)</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>,&#160;however, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining&#160;<em>T. rubripes&#160;</em>fisheries have benefited&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>. Additionally,<em>&#160;T. obscurus&#160;</em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p><p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><em>Takifugu obscurus</em>&#160;can be found in both freshwater and marine protected areas. According to the protection regulations for wetlands in the Poyang Lake of Jiangxi Province (2004) and the implementation of Chinese Fishery Lawin Jiangxi Province (1987), fishing is is banned from March 20th to June 20th every year in Poyang Lake. This corresponds with the spawning migration of this species in China, although whether or not this species spawns in the lake is unknown. Fishing has also been banned for two months from June 1st to July 31st each year since 1987 along the Xiajiang reach, Xingan reach, Jishui reach and Jian reach of the Ganjiang River, where this species has been recorded. However, this does not correspond to the freshwater spawning migration of this species (Huang&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010).<br/></p><p><strong>Further research</strong><br/>The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Individuals have been commonly observed on the moss-covered boulders by, next to, and in streams. Most boulders have accumulated leaf litter on the surface, under which individuals and amplectant pairs have been found (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). All juveniles were observed near stream banks covered with leaf litter and gravel. All other individuals were found on the land within ~1-2 m of water.

During this time, a large amount of garbage collects, light pollution increases, and the forest is exploited (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2013). A stream at one of the popular tourist sites, 'Seethagagula', has been blocked in one place by a private company, and the water has been diverted to an artificial tank to facilitate a place for visitors to bathe (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020).&#160;Downstream from this site large amounts of domestic chemicals (e.g., shampoo) are being disposed of in the stream, and it is suspected that this could negatively impact amphibian populations given that large aggregations of tadpoles (not of this species) were observed at higher elevations of the same stream, but in areas below the polluted site low densities or no individuals were observed (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020). Furthermore, during the dry season the reduced volume of water in the stream may lead to greater concentrations of chemicals in the breeding pools (M.

Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008).&#160; These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests).&#160;<span><br/><span><br/><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a6ef881a-7fff-ab3c-8644-7da02d2b74d6"">Forest dieback could be an additional threat to this species.

Prior to 2013, dieback was never documented within Peak Wilderness, and now a large area has been affected (Wickramasinghe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).Despite several studies (see Ranasinghe and Dissanayake 2003, Ranasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2007, Chandrajith<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2009), the aetiology of&#160; dieback remains enigmatic, though there has been concern that an environmental stressor that kills extensive stands of woody vegetation, apart from the loss of suitable habitats for amphibians, may also directly threaten amphibians. Gunawardena<em> </em><em>et al</em>. (1998) and Jayalal<em> et al.</em> (2017) suggest that high acidity in mist- and rain-water may present a significant risk to the highland biota in Sri Lanka. While there is no direct evidence to date (see Silva <em>et al.</em> 2019) that amphibians are negatively affected; it is thought to be a threat for species that inhabit areas where mist persists for long periods, and for species found in open habitats with aquatic life history stages in shallow lentic habitats (M. Meegaskumbura pers. comm. February 2020).<u><strong><br/></strong></u></span>","This species was previously known from only two specimens (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012). There had been no sightings since the original description and the species was believed to be extinct (Manamendra-Arachchi and Pethiyagoda 1998), given that surveys in the the general area of Kandy turned up no new records. It was rediscovered in 2009, when close to 100 individuals were recorded over the course of a two-year study to document amphibian species richness across an elevational gradient (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012). Another subpopulation of 57 individuals was discovered 42 km away during further surveys from 2011-2014 (Gabadage <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). This species is thought to be common in suitable habitats during the wet season, however the pristine stream habitats in which it occurs are difficult to find (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020). A decreasing population trend is inferred from the ongoing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Sri Lanka and for a long time was known only from the general type locality of ""Ceylon"" (= Sri Lanka). The scientific name appeared to suggest that it might have been collected in the vicinity of the city of Kandy in central Sri Lanka; however, all of the Central Province was referred to as Kandy in the late 19th century, when the species was described (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>In 2009 the species was rediscovered in the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary in Central Province, Sri Lanka, at 1,879 m asl (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012).

Its eastern boundary is adjacent to Horton Plains National Park (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012). In 2014, Gabadage <em>et al. </em>published a report of this species from another locality, in the southern portion of&#160;Pidurutalagala Forest Reserve from 1,400-1,600 m asl, which is ~42 km from the population in Peak Wilderness Sanctuary.

Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 163,122 km<sup>2</sup>. This species is dominant in coastal habitats throughout Caribbean drainages in Venezuela, and there is currently no indication of major population declines. Therefore, <em>C. dearborni</em> is assessed as Least Concern.</p><p></p>","<p><em>Cyprinodon dearborni </em>occupies a range of coastal estuarine habitat, including lagoons, quiet backwaters, and mangrove pools (Pérez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Hylkema&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). This species is capable of temporary emersion, and can persist in thin films of water for several days when evaporative processes reduce available water in salt marshes and inland lagoons (Turko and Wright 2015). This species can withstand a broad range of salinities, and most often occurs in hypersaline lagoons (Feltkamp and Kristensen 1970). Diet is comprised of detritus, unicellular algae, small macroalgae, zooplankton (<em>Artemia</em>), small crustaceans and bryozoans (Feltkamp and Kristensen 1970,&#160;Carmona 1983, Cervigón 1991). Maximum reported body size is approximately 6.1 cm total length (TL) (Cervigón 1991).</p><p></p><p>Hypersaline estuaries are common on the northern coast of South America, due to their shallow depth (&lt;1 m), rain regime with little rainfall and fresh water inputs, very high sunlight throughout the year, high water temperatures and consequently high evaporation. The salinity of these water bodies can vary between 36 ‰ to more than 60 ‰ in marginal areas of the lagoons, and between 80 ‰ and close to 140 ‰. In areas referred to as “Salinas”, depth can be just a few centimetres (Mago 1965, Kristensen 1970, Kristensen and Hulscher-Emeis 1972, Boer <em>et al</em> 1973, Cervigón and Gómez 1986, Cervigón 1991, Cervigón and Ramírez 2003, 2012).</p><p></p><p><em>Cyprinodon dearborni</em>&#160;does not occur in freshwater rivers (lotic ecosystems) or freshwater inland lagoons (lentic ecosystems). In a number of studies, this species has been reported from lagoons that vary dramatically in salinity depending on the season. However, it is rarely found at salinities lower than 35&#160;‰ for any extended periods of time (Hulscher-Emeis 1972,&#160;Chung 1997,&#160;López <em>et al. </em>1996,&#160;Marín 2000,&#160;Toledo <em>et al</em>. 2000, Torcatt 2015).</p><p>Females mature at an average size of 2.5 cm and an average age of 86 days (Carmona 1983, Cervigón 1991). Fecundity increases with size,&#160;ranging from 87 oocytes in females of 20 to 29 mm TL and 298 oocytes in females greater than 40 mm TL. Embryogenesis is temperature dependent and is completed in three days at 35 ° C and in six days at 26 ° C and is not affected up to a salinity of 51 ‰. There is diurnal territorial behaviour among males, for the defence of a mating and spawning area, as well as parental care by these of the fertilized eggs. The larvae are born with 3.42 and 3.96 mm TL and the yolk sac is reabsorbed five days after hatching and larval development is completed in 44 days at 12.5 mm TL.</p>","<p>In Venezuela, deforestation rates are exceeding 164,000 hectares annually, primarily resulting from agricultural expansion (Mazón&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Coastal pollution including the discharge of heavy metals into coastal waterways is probably negatively impacting aquatic habitat in Laguna de Chacopata, Laguna de Los Patos, and in other regions characterized by urbanization and industrial processes (Toledo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000).&#160;In the Western region, north of Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela, as well as the coasts of the Falcón states, and the central eastern coasts of the Miranda, Anzoátegui, Sucre and Nueva Esparta states (Isla de &#160;Margarita and Coche), oil spills, deforestation (slash and burn) of forests in the headwaters of the basins and mangrove forests, alteration of natural drainages (reservoirs, dredging and canals, dikes, channels, artificial lagoons), erosion and sedimentation, destructive floods, physical modification of Salinas associated with shrimp aquaculture and salt exploitation, contamination by domestic and industrial effluents, use of agrochemicals in upper and middle river basins, extraction of mineral material, and improper disposal of artificial solid waste (domestic and industrial waste) all continue to impact habitat quality (Rodríguez Altamiranda 1999, Conde and Carmona-Suarez 2003, Medina and Barboza 2006, Colonnello and Lasso-Alcalá 2011, Flores 2016, Suarez 2016, Rodríguez-Olarte <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>The non-native&#160;<em>Oreochromis mossambicus </em>was introduced in 1964 in Laguna de los Patos (Sucre state) (Carvajal 1965) and its impact on native species has been well documented, displacing 80% of native species in a decade (Aguilera and Carvajal 1976). Likewise, this species has been recorded in some coastal lagoons on the Isla de Margarita (Lasso-Alcalá <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160;<em>Oreochromis nilotucus</em> has been recorded in peripheral lagoon systems of Lago de Maracaibo, as well as in the Ciénagas de El Gran Eneal and Los Olivitos in the Gulf of Venezuela, though its impact on the native species has not yet been evaluated (González-Bencomo and Borjas 2003, Andrade <em>et al. </em>2005, Lasso-Alcalá <em>et al. </em>2008).&#160;<em>Eleotris picta</em>&#160;is an estuarine piscivore registered in a locality near the Morrocoy National Park and the “Cuare” Wildlife Refuge (Falcón state), where <em>C. dearboni</em> is present (Pezold and Cage 2002).</p>  <p>In the Netherland Antilles, naturally occurring freshwater habitat is vulnerable to human impact, including water extraction, impoundment, channelization, and contamination (Debrot 2003). There is anecdotal evidence suggesting that loss of connection with coastal habitat reduces the success of this species in inland waters due to alterations in food availability (Feltkamp and Kristensen 1970). The economies of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao are driven largely by tourism, and continued coastal development will likely impact the availability and quality of habitat (Nijman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).</p>  <p>The Mozambique Tilapia (<em>Oreochromis mossambicus</em>) has established throughout coastal habitats on Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, where it comprises a dominant portion of ichthyofaunal biomass and has apparently reduced the abundance of native species (Debrot 2003, Debrot&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Buurt and Debrot 2012). Similarly, the Guppy (<em>Poecilia reticulata</em>) is established on all three islands, where it has been widely introduced as a biological control to mosquito larvae (Debrot 2003). There is a single collection of <em>Xiphophorus helleri</em> reported from Bonaire, but there is currently no evidence to suggest permanent establishment (Hulsman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).</p>  <p>Despite inferred continuing decline in habitat quality, there is currently no indication that existing threats have resulted in major declines in population size or range extent.</p>","<p>The total population size of this species is unknown. However, it is reported as common to dominant throughout much of the western Caribbean province of Venezuela (Rodríguez-Olarte&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, 2011).

There is no information available regarding the species' population size or trends in abundance. The species is likely declining due to a range of threats to freshwater systems across its range in southeastern Africa, including habitat degradation from pollution, altered flow regimes, overfishing, invasive species, and deforestation resulting in sedimentation. It's not clear to what extent these threats affect wild populations of <em>Microphis fluviatilis</em>.&#160; Therefore the species is listed as Data Deficient.","<em>Microphis fluviatilis</em> occurs in coastal rivers and streams where it can be found in quiet water among vegetation (Skelton 2001) or in the vicinity of logs at river edges.This species likely feeds on minute invertebrate organisms such as crustaceans and insects (Dawson 1985). Ovoviviparous, during mating the female passes eggs to the male and the eggs become fertilized as they pass into the pouch of the male. The male brood the eggs and larvae in an abdominal pouch and give birth to fully formed young.&#160;<br/>Juveniles and adolescent individuals of some species in the same genus occur in marine waters whilst brooding males and adult females inhabit freshwaters or brackish water areas (Ishihara and Tachihara 2008).","Threats to freshwater systems in the region are substantial and include flow alteration from dams, overexploitation, invasive species, and pollution. Most freshwater ecoregions within the range of <em>Microphis fluviatilis</em> are considered Vulnerable or Endangered, with some even being assessed as Critical (Thieme <em>et al.</em> 2005). Such threats are likely leading to declines in abundance for this species, but it's not clear to what extent they are applicable and how big of an effect they are having on wild populations.","There have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for <em>Microphis fluviatilis</em>.

Males have been observed calling from under leaf litter next to small streams and females have been found nearby (Rowley <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species breeds in rocky streams by larval development. Its tadpoles have only been observed under submerged rocks in pools beneath small waterfalls (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is unclear whether breeding is truly restricted to waterfall microhabitats, however tadpoles of stream-breeding frogs are often microhabitat specialists (Inger 1986), and many congeneric larvae are thought to depend on rocky or gravel substrate (Ohler <em>et al</em>. 2011).

In addition, rocks and gravel that make up the species' larval microhabitat are being mined directly from streams for the construction and lining of tourist walking paths. This was observed in the same stream and only several hundred metres from where a tadpole was observed, and the rate of&#160; gravel removal was observed to increase over surveys from 2017 to 2019 (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2020). Historic burning and subsequent ecosystem conversion of the summit of Mount Fansipan and adjacent areas, which are thought to have been previously covered in forest (Nguyen and Harder 1996), are also likely to have disturbed this species.

95970132,12303,Lontra felina,Endangered,A2cd+3cde,2021,2020-01-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Marine Otter is confirmed as Endangered on the basis of inferred  future population decline due to habitat loss and exploitation.  Historical records suggest that the species was abundant until the 19th  century (Tschudi 1844, Darwin 1889), when there occurred a steep decline  in population due to hunting for pelt trade. The species has a  restricted distribution along the Pacific coast from northern Peru along  the Chilean coast to Cape Horn and Isla de Los Estados in Argentina. It  is patchily distributed from Peru to Tierra del Fuego. Its distribution  north of 39°S latitude is becoming highly fragmented because of  exploitation, pollution and increased human occupation along the  seashores. Poaching is still present in many regions, especially south  of 39ºS latitude, where there is little or no enforcement of protective  legislation. The greatest threats to its continuous existence are  accelerating habitat destruction, degradation, and competition for prey,  accidental kill in crab pots and poaching throughout the range. The  original range of Marine Otter has decreased considerably because of  excessive hunting (Redford and Eisenberg 1992), and the species has been  nearly exterminated from the regions of Cape Horn and southern Tierra  del Fuego (Brownell 1978) as well as from the northern extremities of  its former range (Chehebar 1990).<br/><br/>Additionally, Marine Otters are  persecuted and killed directly for alleged damage to local fish,  bivalves, and shrimp populations (Miller <em>et al.</em> 1983, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Apaza <em>et al.</em>  2004).) Illegal fishing techniques (e.g. dynamite fishing, accidental  death by entanglement (bycatch) in fishing nets) are a frequent problem  in several localities of the Peruvian coast, such as Huarmey (Valqui  2012) and Paracas (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Valqui 2012). Pollution of  the Marine Otter's habitat comes from several centres of industrial  fishing activity like Chimbote (probably the most important fishing port  at the Peruvian coast) and mining cities Ite, Ilo and Marcona in Peru,  where tailings have been spilled directly into the ocean for over 40  years, altering several kilometres of the littoral zone (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>A  common denominator for all regions is that there is very lenient law  enforcement regarding the Marine Otter's conservation status and  protection, as hunting or killings on fish farms do not implicate  consequences to the offenders. Global natural factors like the El Niño  Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also may considerably affect the marine  otter population (Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2010), due to the more or less  drastic climatic and oceanographic changes that cause the mortality of  several marine communities from fish to mammals (Apaza and Figari 1999,  Wang and Fiedler 2006).<br/><br/>Based on the records of historical  decline in population due to extensive hunting for the pelt trade, the  species can be categorised as Endangered under criteria A2cd, due to a  suspected decline in population of ≥ 50% over the past three  generations, or 30 years (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). The ongoing  threats, such as poaching, habitat loss, retaliatory killings, and  accidental mortalities, are suspected to result in future population  reductions of ≥50% over the next three generations (30 years Pacifici <em>et al.</em>  2013) unless conservation measures are strengthened. Therefore, the  Marine Otter is listed under the category Endangered based on criteria  A2cd+3cde.</p>","<em>Lontra felina</em> is the only species of the genus <em>Lontra </em>that is found exclusively in marine habitats. The species is more agile in water as compared to land. It uses coastlines with range extending approximately 30 m inland and 100–150 m of sea offshore (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979). The species inhabits marine areas exposed to heavy seas and strong wind (Cabello 1978, Ostfeld <em>et al.</em> 1989) and prefers rocky shores with caves that are above the water level at high tide, as well as areas with large algae communities offering an abundance and diversity of prey species (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979). Sandy beaches offer marginal habitat (Sielfeld 1989) and typically are used only for travel between dens and water (Ebensperger and Castilla 1992). Marine Otters are, for the most part, restricted to marine waters, but may occasionally travel up freshwater rivers in search of prey (Brownell 1978, Cabello 1978, Redford and Eisenberg 1992). Because not all coastlines are suitable, marine otters are found in disjunct populations throughout their distribution range (Redford and Eisenberg 1992).<br/> <br/> The fact that Marine Otters are solitary or only gathering in small groups suggests high ecological requirements regarding space. The species' preference for coastal waters offering a wide abundance and diversity of prey species (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979) is in conflict with the increasing artisan and industrial fishing effort. Marine Otters are top predators with a high metabolic rate, thus pollution of their environments may affect them more than other species, as their position in the food chain leads to high bioaccumulation of heavy metals, pesticides and other toxic elements.<br/> <br/> The Marine Otter diet is composed mostly of invertebrates, including crustaceans (decapods, shrimps, and crabs) and molluscs (bivalves and gastropods), and vertebrate prey, including fish belonging to the families Blennidae, Cheilodactylidae, Gobiesocidae, and Pomacentridae, and occasionally birds and small mammals (Cabello 1978, Castilla and Bahamondes 1979, Ostfeld <em>et al</em>. 1989, Sielfeld 1990). Along the Valdivian coast in the south of Chile the diet of marine otter consisted of 25 species; 52% (13/25) of the species identified were crustaceans, 40% (10/25) were fish, and 8% (2/25) were molluscs. Crustaceans were found in 78% of 475 spraints, 100% of 929 prey remains, and 90.8% of prey determined by direct observation, fish in 20% of spraints and 9.0% of prey determined by direct observation, and molluscs in 2% of spraints and 0.2% of prey determined by direct observation. Observed seasonal variation in prey availability was reflected in the otter diet. Fourteen prey species were trapped; 43% (6/14) crustaceans and 57% (8/14) fish. Crustaceans were 93% of 566 trapped individuals, fish 7%. <em>L. felina</em> showed opportunistic feeding behaviour, selecting prey seasonally according to their availability rather than to their energy input (Medina-Vogel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;<br/> <br/> Some studies have found that fruits (<em>Greigia sphacelata</em>, <em>Fascicularia bicolor</em>) may also be consumed occasionally (Brownell 1978, Cabello 1978, Medina 1995). Marine Otters may compete with gulls (<em>Larus</em>) and the South American Sea Lion (<em>Otaria flavescens</em>) for similar species of prey fish (Cabello 1978). The most important natural predator of the Marine Otter is the Killer Whale (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Cabello 1978), but adults also may be killed by sharks (Parera 1996) and birds of prey may capture juveniles when on land (Cabello 1983). <br/> <br/> The Marine Otter is most likely a monogamous species. Mating typically occurs during December or January (Cabello 1978) with gestation of 60-65 days (Housse 1953, Sielfield 1989). Parturition usually occurs from January to March. It takes place in a den or on shore between rocky outcroppings and vegetation. The litter size varies from two to four young, with two being observed most frequently. Young Marine Otters remain with their parents for approximately ten months. Adults transport their young by carrying them in their mouths or resting the young on their bellies as they swim on their backs. Both adults in the monogamous pair bring prey back to the den to feed their young (Parera 1996). During non-breeding season, Marine Otters are mostly solitary. The group size is seldom more than two to three individuals. Its activity pattern is generally diurnal, with peaks of activity noted in early morning, mid-afternoon, and evenings.","<p>Hunting was the major threat on the Marine Otter in the 20th Century  (Sielfeld and Castilla 1999). 38,000 otter pelts were exported from  Chile between 1910 and 1954 (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986). Although two  otter species (<em>L. provocax</em> and <em>L. felina</em>) were subsumed as “otters” and  no hunting estimate of each species can be inferred from this data,  these numbers show the magnitude of the pelt industry in the 20th  Century. Today, the lack of demand in the pelt market and fur trade  prohibitions, have diminished this threat considerably. Nonetheless,  illegal hunting for fur and trophies still occur in some areas as  Samanco, (Sánchez and Ayala 2006), La Libertad (15°29'S) and Morro Sama  (18°00'S) (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004), Peru and south of 39°S latitude in Chile.<br/><br/>In  the last decades, the major threats derive from an intensive  urbanization of western South America, where the immense anthropogenic  pressure on the coastal ecosystem accelerates habitat degradation and  increases its fragmentation (Brownell 1978, Eisenberg and Redford 1989,  Sielfield and Castilla 1999, Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2008, Vianna <em>et al.</em>  2010). It is not yet clear at what point these fragmentation forces  will cause isolation to result in local extinction events due to lack of  gene flow (Valqui 2012). In any case, these global changes will trigger  much more localized threats in different regions. In and around human  settlements, big dens with terrestrial entrances may be occupied by  dogs, cats and rats, displacing the Marine Otter from its reproduction,  feeding and resting areas (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2003, Valqui 2012). Dog attacks are increasingly reported in several locations of the distribution (Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2008, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2010, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Industrial  and artisan fishing ports have been established along the Pacific  coast, affecting structure and productivity of marine life communities.  Although <em>Lontra felina</em> shows certain capacity to coexist with humans,  for example in fishing ports (Valqui 2004, Ruiz 2009, Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em>  2007), fishing has intensified global natural declines in the abundance  of many forage fishes, leading to reduced reproductive success and  reduced abundance of birds and marine mammals (Majluf <em>et al.</em>  2002). The human-otter coexistence implies competition for resources  that humans exploit for food, commerce and housing (Moreno <em>et al.</em> 1984; Ostfeld <em>et al.</em> 1989; Moreno 2001; Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2004, 2007, 2008), as it is the case of mariculture (crabs and molluscs (Apaza <em>et al.</em>  2004). Additionally, the species may be persecuted and killed directly  for alleged damage to local fish, bivalves, and shrimp populations,  which are of consumptive value (Miller <em>et al.</em> 1983, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Apaza <em>et al.</em>  2004).). Illegal fishing techniques (e.g. dynamite fishing) are a  frequent problem in several localities of the Peruvian coast, such as  Huarmey (Valqui 2012) and Paracas (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Valqui 2012). Industrial ships have frequently been observed fishing closer to the coast than allowed by law (Apaza <em>et al.</em>  2004), perturbing the coastal habitat on a broader scale. Another  threat for Marine Otters is accidental death by entanglement (bycatch)  in fishing nets (Brownell 1978, Mangel and Alfaro-Shigueto 2004, Pizarro  2008) and in crab pots (Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2004), although the dimension of these mortality cases is unknown.<br/><br/>Pollution  of the Marine Otter´s habitat comes from several centres of industrial  fishing activity like Chimbote (probably the most important fishing port  at the Peruvian coast) and mining cities Ite, Ilo and Marcona in Peru,  where tailings have been spilled directly into the ocean for over 40  years, altering several kilometres of the littoral (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Additionally,  spills of domestic effluents reach the ocean directly or indirectly,  through rivers (Hinrichsen 1998, Thorne-Miller 1999). Thus, heavy metals  and other toxic substances can be diffused through currents and  progressively transmitted through the food chain at least in a regional  level (Valqui 2004, Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004). Oil spillage and extreme  noise affect the species in areas near beach resorts in the vicinity of  big cities (Valqui 2004).<br/><br/>A common denominator for all regions is  that there is very law enforcement regarding the Marine Otter´s  conservation status and protection, as hunting or killings on fish farms  do not implicate consequences to the offenders.<br/><br/>Global natural  factors like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also may  considerably affect the Marine Otter population (Vianna <em>et al.</em>  2010), due to the more or less drastic climatic and oceanographic  changes that cause the mortality of several marine communities from fish  to mammals (Apaza and Figari 1999, Wang and Fiedler 2006).</p>","<p>The density estimates proposed by various authors are variable (from 0.04 to 10 individuals per kilometre, see Castilla and Bahamondes 1979, Castilla 1982, Cabello 1983, Rozzi and Torres-Mura 1990, Ebensperger and Castilla 1991, Sanchez 1992, Sielfeld 1992, Medina-Vogel 1995, Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mangel and Alfaro-Shigueto 2004, Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2006), therefore the reported numbers are to be taken with care. Survey numbers and abundance estimations are highly dependent on the methodology applied (Valqui 2012) and detecting individuals on the rocky shores is very difficult. The fact that the species is solitary or only present in very small groups (not larger than ten individuals) makes it difficult to determine if the species is abundant in one specific area. Nevertheless, a global population of about 800 to 2,000 individuals is proposed for the Peruvian coast (<em>ca</em>&#160;150 km) by Valqui (2012).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Marine Otter is distributed along the southern Pacific Coast of  South America from Chimbote (9°S) in northern Peru (Valqui 2012), to  Isla Grevy (56°S) at the southern tip of Chile (Sielfeld 1997) and  eastwards to the Isla de los Estados (54°S), in Argentina (Parera 1996).  In 1964, Schweigger reported Lontra felina up to the Isla Lobos de  Tierra (6° 26'S) in northern Peru. Studies of the last decades  registered the northern range limit at Chimbote (9°S) (Brack 1978,  Brownell 1978, Larivière 1998, Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sánchez and Ayala 2006, Valqui <em>et al.</em>  2010). Recent sightings in Huanchaco (8°S) suggest at least occasional  events of recolonization north to the actual northern limit of  distribution range, yet reasons for appearance or disappearance in these  areas remain unclear (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al.</em> 2011). In the south  the species´ presence is unclear in the XVth, Ist, XIth and XIIth  regions and in the Tierra del Fuego region in Argentina (Cassini 2008).<br/><br/>Although  Redford and Eisenberg (1992) stated that the original range of Lontra  felina has decreased considerably because of excessive hunting in the  past decades, the authors do not mention any specific regions or study  cases. Brownell (1978) stated that the species has been nearly  exterminated from the regions of Cape Horn and southern Tierra del Fuego  but several works (Sielfeld 1989, 1990, 1992; Sielfeld and Castilla  1999) reported the species' presence between 49°S (Puerto Orella) and  55°S (Isla Grevy).<br/><br/>The Marine Otter´s habitat is naturally  fragmented in a very heterogeneous alternation of suitable habitat  (rocky shore patches with caves or, sometimes, docks, shipwrecks or  abandoned fishing boats) and unsuitable habitat (sandy beaches or rocky  shoreline without caves). Thus, Marine Otters may be absent in several  hundreds of kilometres of coast throughout the species´ total  distribution range (Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2010, Valqui 2012).</p>",For Use and Trade information see under Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The Marine Otter is protected in Argentina, Chile, and Peru.

At present, poaching is a minor problem but still occurs, particularly south of 43°S latitude where control of hunting is difficult to implement. Extirpation of the Southern River Otter began in local basins but has become widespread. The lack of re-establishment of the species is probably due to high mortality or reproductive failure following the dispersal of otters into unsuitable areas (Medina 1996). This is resulting in a population that is becoming increasingly fragmented and more susceptible to local extinctions through habitat destruction, human disturbance, predation by domestic dogs, and demographic or environmental stochastic events. Genetic studies have confirmed a lower genetic diversity in the northern freshwater subpopulations in comparison to those from the south confirming a past bottleneck probably due to anthropogenic factors (Centron <em>et al.</em> 2008,&#160;Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species has suffered a suspected past population decline of ≥50% over the last 30 years or three generations (based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) in its range countries due to habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, overhunting for the pelt trade, and direct persecution due to retaliation (Chehébar 1990). Accelerating habitat destruction and degradation throughout the Southern River Otter's range is the greatest threat to the species, and is suspected (based on current trends) to lead to a future ≥50% reduction in population size over the next 30 years (three generations based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) for those subpopulations using rivers and lakes (freshwater habitats), and for the subpopulations using the southern fjords and islands (marine habitats) the population decline may be due to the impacts of intensive fishery activities. Therefore, based on the suspected population decline in the past and future, the species is categorised as Endangered under criteria A2cd+3cde.</p>","<p>The Southern River Otter is distributed in the southern temperate forest of South America. This species presents a distribution associated with inland waters in the northern parts of its range, and marine habitat in the southern part of its range. In freshwater habitats otters are associated with the presence of macro-crustaceans from the genus <em>Aegla spp.</em> and <em>Sammastacus spp. </em>(Aued <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al.</em> 2009,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al. </em>2009), which are the otter’s main prey (Medina 1997,&#160;Medina-Vogel and Gonzalez-Lagos 2008,&#160;Fasola <em>et al. </em>2009,&#160;Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011,&#160;Franco <em>et al. </em>2013). Other species of crustaceans, fish and amphibians are also in the otter’s diet but are of marginal occurrence. The species uses rivers with abundant vegetation (Chehebar <em>et al.</em> 1986,&#160;Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2003) and inhabit diverse types of wetlands including Andean lakes, rivers of different sizes, ponds and estuaries. A study using telemetry described an average home range of 11.3 km, with solitary behaviour and a low spatial overlap between individuals of same sex suggesting intrasexual territoriality (Sepúlveda <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the marine range the species uses the marine rocky coast with abundant vegetation cover and low exposure to wind and waves (Sielfeld 1992,&#160;Sielfeld and Castilla 1999). In this environment the Southern River Otter is sympatric with the Marine Otter (<em>L. felina</em>), but the latter is segregated by its use of more wave-exposed coastal areas (Sielfeld 1992,&#160;Ebensperger and Botto-Mahan 1997). The diet in the marine environment is composed of coastal fish of the genera <em>Harpagifer</em>, <em>Patagonotothen</em>, <em>Eleginops</em>, <em>Cottoperca</em> and crustaceans of the genera <em>Munida, Taliepus, Cancridae, Galatheidae, Lithodidae, Lithodes, Paralomis </em>and<em> Campylonotus&#160;</em>(Sielfeld and Castilla 1999,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2013). In general, for both marine and inland waters the Southern River Otter seems to be a specialized aquatic bottom forager preying on slow benthic fish and crustaceans.</p>","The Southern River Otter habitat is very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts (Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). In those subpopulations inhabiting freshwater environments, the high demand for water by human activities such as agriculture, human use, etc. is altering watercourses through canalization and drainage and loss of riparian vegetation. These activities are promoted to increase the amount of agricultural lands but are impacting those otter subpopulations distributed in lowlands, particularly in the Central Valley and the Coastal Range of Chile (Medina-Vogel&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003,&#160;Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). In the case of Andean lakes, where the species occurred historically, the high level of urbanization and tourism has been proposed as the main causes responsible for the local extinction of the species in those areas (Medina 1996). Other threats are poaching (Medina 1996,&#160;Espinosa 2012), predation by free-ranging domestic dogs (Espinosa 2012) and transmission of diseases such as Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014). Free-ranging dogs are an important threat to carnivores because of predation and disease transmission (Vanak and Gompper 2009), and are present in rural and protected areas where the Southern River Otter occurs (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Implementing dog population control measures as well as vaccination programmes are an important measure to mitigate the impact of dogs on this species (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In several parts of the otter's distribution range, hydroelectric dams are installed or are planned to be built in the near future but no research on the potential impact of these on the otters has been conducted so far. The presence of wild exotic salmon and the salmon farming industry are suggested as a potential threat to otter prey leading to potential competition between otters and salmon (Medina 1996,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009) but no studies have confirmed this as yet. In relation to the invasive American Mink (<em>Neovison vison</em>), although several studies have investigated competition between these mustelids and river otters (Medina 1997,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Fasola <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013), there is no clear evidence of a negative effect of the mink on the otter. Indeed, current studies in the marine part of the range suggest a negative effect of otters over minks by habitat (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013) and temporal segregation (Medina‐Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2013). The invasive mink is a potential vector of CDV to otters given their behavioural similarities and sharing of latrines (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Most studies on this species have been made based on indirect signs of the species, hence, there are no estimates of population or subpopulation size. The freshwater subpopulations have been studied more than those in marine environments. Monitoring of signs such as spraints or tracks has been implemented particularly for the population in Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina by the Administration of National Parks for over 30 years (Chehebar 1985, Chehebar <em>et al</em>. 1986, Chehébar and Porro 1998, Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pozzi and Chehebar 2013). A relatively stable otter distribution has been observed in this area with some marginal expansion outside the Nahuel Huapi Park in the Limay River (Carmanchahi <em>et al</em>. 2006). In this population recent volcanic activity during 2011 could have disrupted freshwater ecosystems, consequently affecting the otter population, but there are no studies on the subject, which are of utmost urgency.<br/> <br/> Freshwater subpopulations have been described as fragmented and comprised of seven isolated subpopulations (Medina 1996) but subsequent surveys have identified presence in areas previously thought not to have otters (Rodríguez<em> et al</em>. 2008); it is not clear if this is the result of a recent recolonization or sampling bias in earlier studies, and more research is needed. A radio-telemetry study in the Queule River found densities of 0.25 otters/km of river (Sepúlveda<em> et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Studies of the marine population in Chile indicate that the otter distribution in this environment would be continuous and abundances estimated are 0.57 otters/km of coast (Sielfeld 1992). Studies based on indirect signs in marine populations in Argentina, indicate two separate subpopulations, one in Isla de Los Estados (Provincial Reserve) and the other in Bahia Lapataia, Tierra del Fuego National Park, in the Beagle Channel (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> During 1910–1954 a total of 38,263 otter pelts (<em>Lontra felina</em> and <em>L. provocax</em>) were exported from Chile but after that period no exports exist due to the implementation of different laws and international agreements (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986).",Decreasing,"The Southern River Otter occurs in Chile and Argentina in freshwater and marine environments. The freshwater distribution is located in the northern part of the otter’s range and was historically wider in both countries. In Chile, river otters occurred from Cachapoal River (34ºS) (Gay 1847, Reed 1877) up to the Peninsula de Taitao (46ºS) with a continuous distribution in rivers and lakes (Medina 1996). The current distribution in Chile has been strongly restricted from north to south due to land use change and human colonization (Medina 1996), as a consequence, the otter populations are only found at present from the Imperial River (38ºS) (Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011) to the south. &#160;In Argentina freshwater subpopulations were distributed historically from the Neuquen Province (36ºS) to the Lake Buenos Aires (46ºS) and mostly associated with water courses from the Andean Range and the steppe (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012). The present freshwater distribution in Argentina is mostly restricted to the Limay watershed, mainly within the Nahuel Huapi National Park (Chehebar 1985, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Southern River Otter subpopulations that inhabit marine environments are distributed along the Pacific coast of Chile from 46ºS to Tierra del Fuego in Chile (Cabrera 1957, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Sielfeld 1992, Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Argentina, marine subpopulations are present only in the Archipielago Fueguino in Los Estados Island and the Beagle Channel (Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006, Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2012, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). Marine river otters in Argentina are probably a continuous subpopulation of the main otter subpopulation in Chile (Sielfeld 1992).",The species is hunted for their pelts which are used to make clothing.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The Southern River Otter is listed on CITES Appendix I and listed on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Appendix I.<br/> <br/> In Chile, the conservation status is listed by the Reglamento de Clasificación de Especies as Endangered in VI, VII, VIII, IX, XIV and X Districts and as Data Deficient in XI and XII Districts (Chile 2011). In Chile, the Subsecretaria de Pesca is the governmental agency responsible of their conservation and management. In those populations inside official protected areas the Corporacion Nacional Forestal is responsible for their conservation. National Action plans in Chile are developed by the Minisiterio del MedioAmbiente, but despite its conservation status, no Action Plan exists for this species at present, which is the most urgent conservation action priority. Hunting is prohibited since 1929 in Chile (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986) and the governmental agency responsible for hunting permits and enforcement is the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero.<br/> <br/> In Argentina, the conservation status is Endangered (EN A3cd) (Valenzuela et al. 2012). At national level, the governmental agency responsible of native wildlife conservation and management is the Secretaría de Ambiente y DesarrolloSustentable de la Nación through the Dirección de Fauna Silvestre. The Administración de Parques Nacionales (National Parks Administration) is responsible for conservation of those populations inside the national protected areas, where the species is classified as Special Value Species (APN 1994.). The two populations in Argentina from freshwater and marine habitats are mostly inside national protected areas.<br/> Because of the several agencies involved in the management of the species a strong coordination with clear responsibilities and a work agenda is a major urgency in the short term. Actions recommended for both Chile and Argentina are:</p>  <ul>  <li>To develop a Conservation      Bi-National Plan for the species;</li>  <li>To develop specific National      Conservation Plans for each country;</li>  <li>To develop validated Monitoring      Programmes in protected and unprotected lands; particularly in Chile where      there is no such activity in any population; and</li>  <li>To reinforce the importance of environmental impact assessment      projects in relation to the species in order to adequately determine: a)      presence of otter population in areas of projects, and b) in those      projects requiring to implement adequate actions to incorporate: 1)      measures of monitoring, 2) mitigation and 3) compensation activities.</li> </ul>  <br/> There have not been any reintroduction attempts, which could be an appropriate conservation action considering the success of such plans in North American and European species. Although otters are one of the most appealing species in zoo/aquarium exhibitions providing good opportunities for education and awareness about conservation issues in aquatic environments, no known individuals of the Southern River Otter are currently in captivity and there are no historical records for any captive animals.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa. A continuing population decline of at least 10% in a&#160;90 year three generation period,&#160;is anticipated based on continuing and increasing anthropogenic threats (Vulnerable C1).<br/><br/>The African Manatee therefore qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>West and Central Africa contain a variety of suitable habitats for Manatees ranging from large and small rivers, coastal estuaries, freshwater and saltwater lagoons, shallow quiet coastal bays, lakes and reservoirs. Like <em>T. manatus</em>, <em>T. senegalensis</em> inhabits practically every accessible habitat (Powell 1996, Dodman <em>et al.</em> 2008). They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Loémé, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake Léré and Lake de Tréné (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: Digboué Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, Ebrié Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, N’gowe (Iguela) Lagoon, N’dogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

Its area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 366 km²<span class=""A10"">, and the extent of occupancy is 2,128 km². The species is known to exist at no more than four locations. The area and quality of its available habitat is declining due to agricultural intensification. This decline is predicted to continue into the future.","<p>The species is an inhabitant of steppe and forest-steppe grasslands. It is typically found in areas of closed steppe on loess (Natura 2000 code: 6240*) and uncharacteristic dry grasslands (mostly degraded or secondary dry grasslands), <span lang=""EN-US"">and loess in mesic grasslands. Also present in perennial intensive arable fields (such as alfalfa), and the mosaics above (Sugár 2012). <span lang=""EN-US"">The species seems to prefer slopes over valleys, although avoids very steep slopes (Sugár 2012). Most of its habitats are used as pastureland, however it seems to avoid overgrazed pastures. It may occasionally enter some small-plot arable lands, especially alfalfa, for foraging. Strictly subterranean, and more agile and aggressive compared to <em>Nannospalax </em>(superspecies <em>leucodon</em>). Blind mole rats are a food resource for several threatened species of birds of prey, the survival, reproductive success, and population size of these species may partly depend on the density of the rodents (Németh <em>et al</em></span>. 2016).</p>","<p>The most important threatening factors are the different processes leading to habitat loss. In the past, the expansion of agriculture was the most prominent cause for the loss of the best habitats for blind mole rats. The most fertile loess soils were the first to undergo changes in land use which has pushed blind mole-rat populations to less favourable areas. The widespread use of deep tillage was the single most important direct effect that drastically reduced blind mole-rat population sizes and distribution. Firstly, repeated ploughing does not allow the formation of the vegetation type necessary for the survival of blind mole-rats; secondly, deep ploughing destroys their underground burrow systems as well as the animals themselves. Small plot farming with mosaics of fallow land has often given way to intensive crop production in large monocultures. Nowadays, the most common reason causing tillage is not so much the cultivation itself but the fulfilment of the requirements to apply for funding from the European Community. Blind mole rats often colonise abandoned land if that is close to their habitat. When the owner decides to start cultivating again, these subpopulations can be destroyed.<br/><br/>Urbanisation, site development and road constructions are threats to this species<em>. </em>Most of the land in these cases is the property of the municipality and impending industrial investments can mean complete eradication. Road construction can also annihilate populations. This mainly concerns non-protected areas.<br/><br/>Overgrazing<strong> </strong>greatly reduces species diversity, and causes a significant decrease in the food resources of blind mole-rats. Sheep populations within the species’ range are generally very high, and grazing is currently not controlled by any effective legal means, which has led to a decline or local extinction of several plant and animal species dependent on dry grasslands (e.g. meadow viper <em>Vipera ursinii rakosiensis</em>).<br/><br/>Limited habitat sizes and low population sizes threaten the long-term viability of populations with inbreeding and other genetic problems.<br/><br/>Hadid <em>et al</em>. (2012) analysed the phylogeny of the subfamily Spalacinae calibrated by fossil records. Revealed evolutionary events show a remarkable synchronization with the cycles of solar orbital fluctuations (eccentricity and precession) driving the ice ages. This makes it plausible that global climate changes following the ice ages played an important role in the formation of the unusually high genetic diversity of blind mole-rats.<br/><br/>We can also be sure that the present changes in global climate will significantly impact blind mole-rats, but the direction and the extent of this impact cannot be predicted. In the past, such processes resulted in new taxa of blind mole-rats, but current changes are heavily distorted by human influence. There is a whole host of evidence (Nevo <em>et al </em>1994a,b, 1995; 2000a,b; Reyes <em>et al</em>. 2003; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) that genetically and geographically distinct taxa adapted to the specific climate of their own range during their speciation. However, blind mole-rat habitats have shrunk to small, isolated fragments that are few and far between, within a matrix impenetrable for blind mole-rats. Isolation is further abetted by their severely limited dispersal capacities. Thus, there is a high likelihood that ongoing climatic changes would rather wipe out blind mole-rat species than give rise to new ones.<br/><br/>Even though Méhely’s blind mole rat is a protected species in Romania, there are still cases of intentional destruction. It is extremely hard to measure this kind of activity. Conflicts arise from some individuals living and foraging close to human settlements, damaging ornamental plants and vegetables. Another anthropogenic threat is the disturbance and destruction caused by pets (dogs as well as cats). Stray dogs and herding dogs are known to have killed individuals.</p>    <p><br/></p>","<p>Population is fragmented, and habitat fragmentation is ongoing.

Though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> occurs in most major river systems from the Mississippi River to the Suwannee River in Florida and in marine waters of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico south to Florida Bay. <br/> <br/>As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997, although Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River and in the Saint John River. The current number of mature individuals most likely numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy for this subspecies is very large (&gt;1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline). Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and re-colonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations.

Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. The subspecies is assessed as Near Threatened based on past population declines and because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery. <br/> <br/>Records for <em>A. o. desotoi</em> fisheries during the period 1887–1985 indicated that peak Florida harvest occurred in 1900–1902 (124 mt/year) followed by precipitous decline into the 1920s.  From 1923–1971 harvest was fairly stable at about 7 mt per year; declined to 2.3 mt through the 1970s; and fell further to only 0.3 mt until fisheries were closed in 1986 (Barkuloo 1988). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. With a relatively small and widely scattered population, continued habitat disturbances and contaminant threats, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> is assessed as Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>Overall, the Atlantic sturgeon <em>A. oxyrinchus</em> is considered Near Threatened based on the population declines suffered in the past and uncertainties about overall health of the population and the lengthy time required for recovery.","The Atlantic sturgeon is a large anadromous species. <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> is recorded to live for up to 60 years and reach a size of 4.3 m and 368 kg (Vladykov and Greely 1963), though most mature fish are considerably smaller. Spawning occurs in fresh or slightly brackish water when water temperatures reached 13–18˚C. Migrations into coastal tidal rivers begin as early as February in the southern portion of the range and continue through June and July in northernmost waters. In the mid-Atlantic area, Atlantic sturgeon males mature at 6–10 years and females at 10–20 years (ASMFC 1990). Maturation occurs earlier in southern waters and later in Canada. Spawning periodicity ranges from 2–6 years.

The largest fishery was in the Delaware River and Bay which by 1890 supported over 1,000 fishermen and produced 2,300 metric tons of sturgeon product. Several dozen other rivers supported sturgeon fisheries and by the late 1890s, total Atlantic Coast U.S. landings reached 3,200 mt. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. Throughout the 1970s to mid-1980s, prior to declaration of fishing moratoria, annual U.S. harvest of Atlantic sturgeon ranged from 50–100 mt with most fish being taken from the Hudson River (NY), coastal New Jersey and the Carolinas (ASMFC 1990). <br/> <br/>In 1998, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a comprehensive ""Status Review of Atlantic Sturgeon"" in response to a petition to list this species as threatened or endangered under the U.

The subpopulation estimate for Gulf sturgeon older than age two in the Choctawhatchee River ranges from 1,700–3,000 fish, while subpopulation estimates  in the Apalachicola, Pascagoula and Pearl rivers range from 50–350 fish (Lorio 2000). The number of mature individuals in this range wide population were not estimated but most likely number less than 10,000.

These authors identified five regional or river-specific stocks: (1) Lake Ponchartrain and Pearl River; (2) Pascagoula River; (3) Escambia and Yellow rivers; (4) Choctawhatchee River; and (5) Apalachicola, Ochlockonee, and Suwannee rivers.",Increasing,"<em>A. oxyrinchus</em> occurs in the Atlantic coastal waters of Canada and the United States with spawning rivers in both countries. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> historically ranged along the Canadian and U.S. Atlantic Coast from Labrador to Florida.

Also, a single fisherman is licensed on the Shubenacadie River in Nova Scotia. The St. Lawrence fishery was limited in 1997 to a quota of 6,015 fish - about 60 tons (Caron and Trembly 1997). Other regulations here include a maximum size limit of 1.5 m during a season extending from 1 May to 30 September. <br/> <br/>Peak landings on the Saint John River were 44 metric tones (mt) in 1988 but have declined in recent years to 10–14 mt.

Minimum allowable size of sturgeon on the St. John is 120 cm and the season is closed during 1–30 June to protect spawners. Canadian authorities have expressed to U.S. authorities that these harvest levels are sustainable and do not damage the stocks (USFWS and NMFS 1998). A private aquaculture activity also occurs in New Brunswick with eggs and progeny produced from wild-caught adult sturgeon. Except for a few hundred live juveniles, most international trade in <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> in the late 1990s has been meat (2–34 mt/year) from Canada to the U.S. (CITES data). <br/> <br/>No commercial or sport fishing for Atlantic sturgeon is allowed in territorial waters of the U.S. Atlantic Coast. The management authority for this species is the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and their amendment to the 1990 Fishery Management Plan (ASMFC 1998) requires (1) no possession allowed in the 15 Atlantic states until at least 20 year-classes reach breeding age (30–40 years); (2) annual reporting of by-catch and by-catch mortality; (3) urges habitat monitoring and improvements as well as research and genetics analysis; and (4) places certain restrictions on sturgeon culture for market production and restocking.  In addition to the ASMFC action, the Secretary of Commerce has closed all U.S. Atlantic coastal EEZ waters to harvest of Atlantic sturgeon. <br/> <br/>The recent USFWS-NMFS joint status review for Atlantic sturgeon determined that listing this species as threatened or endangered under the U.S. ESA is not warranted at this time. Atlantic sturgeon are widespread and several subpopulations could be considered relatively abundant. However, because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery, USFWS has designated Atlantic sturgeon as a ""candidate species"" for possible future ESA listing and NMFS lists it as a ""species of concern"". <br/> <br/>In 1991, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> was listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Since then considerable work has been accomplished to better define life history and behavior and to determine habitats important to each life stage, population status, genetic assessment and fish culture. A recovery and management plan for Gulf sturgeon was completed in 1995 (USFWS and GSMFC 1995). This plan identifies state and federal actions necessary to rebuild populations to levels that would allow de-listing of the subspecies. In 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service officially designated ""critical habitat"" for this species, including 2,783 river kilometers and 6,042 square km of estuarine and marine habitat. <br/> <br/>With federal protection under the ESA and intensive permitting and consultation requirements for all water-related projects and discharges - especially in areas designated to be critical habitat - it is believed that <em>A. o. desotoi</em> population declines will be halted and reversed.<br/><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Anjouan is both densely-populated and poorly-surveyed, and while agama invasion is the major identified threat it is possible the species is subject to ongoing pressures that are having a greater impact than presently recognized. As such further research may reveal that this species warrants a higher listing.","This skink is a specialist of the tidal zones of rocky coasts, where it is usually the only reptile species observed. Colonization of other habitats is probably prevented by competition with other native species of reptiles.","Potential threats to this skink include habitat modification and introduced species. Ongoing human population growth leads to degradation of coastal habitats through waste disposal (attracting rats that are likely to prey on this species as eggs, juveniles and adults) and structural modification, e.g., for infrastructure.<em> Cryptoblepharus</em> were found to be a prime prey of waders (including Great Egret, Striped Bittern, Madagascar Pond-heron) (Probst 1997, Probst <em>et al.</em> 2002), of all 'omnivorous' birds (including the very abundant - and invasive - Common Myna and Common Ravens) (Honsterette and Probst 1999). Anjouan is the most heavily-populated of the Comoros Islands but is not well-surveyed for reptiles so the identity of any ongoing threats is unclear (O. Hawlitscheck and S. Augros pers. comm. 2020). There is, however, a high likelihood of the introduction of invasive species in the medium term, including the common agama (<em>Agama agama</em>) which has been observed to competitively exclude the related <em>Cryptoblepharus ater</em>&#160;from coastal areas of Grand Comore (S. Augros pers. comm. 2020).",There is no quantitative or semi-quantitative population data available.

On the Venezuelan side of Mount Roraima, there is an ongoing threat caused by anthropogenic fires ignited by Amerindians, which have been known to affect tepuis in the surrounding Venezuelan savannah (P. Kok pers. comm. November 2017). A synergy between this and climate change could occur, with a predicted decrease in precipitation for the region of up to 10% this century (IPCC 2007) enabling an increase in fire prevalence (Rull <em>et al</em>. 2013). The subpopulation on Maringma tepui is also possibly threatened by fires (P. Kok pers. comm. November 2017). Furthermore, habitat disturbance and degradation (from litter) is ongoing due to an increase of mostly unregulated tourism on Mount Roraima (Kok<em> et al</em>. 2013), with 3,000-4,000 tourists climbing this mountain each year (Sim 2015). Gold mining is occurring on Mount Ayanganna and around the base of Wokomung massif and could be affecting the habitat of this species. There have been no visits to Wokomung massif in recent years, so it is unknown whether mining has increased and expanded to higher elevations (P. Kok pers. comm.

119333622,3897,Caretta caretta,Vulnerable,A2b,2017,2015-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em><strong>Rationale<br/></strong></em>The global population of the Loggerhead Turtle (<em>Caretta caretta</em>) comprises 10 subpopulations (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) that vary widely in population size, geographic range, and population trends, and are the appropriate units for assessment of global conservation status for this species (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). As such, assessments have been completed for each of the 10 subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). At the global level, both geographic distribution and population size are much larger than required to qualify for a threatened category. The available long-term series of nest counts (used as an index of population abundance) show an important decrease in the past (47%). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle is considered as Vulnerable under current IUCN Red List Criteria (criterion A2b). The previous listing, published in 1996, was Endangered under criterion A1bd (Marine Turtle Specialist Group 1996).<br/><br/>Results indicate that the Loggerhead Turtle, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation according to any Red List criteria. However, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Loggerhead Turtle population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by IUCN Red List Categories), but also in the criteria under which the individual subpopulations qualified for a threatened category (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). For these reasons, the subpopulation-level assessments for the Loggerhead Turtle should be given priority in evaluating the true global conservation status of this species. This conclusion follows the precedent for other long-lived, widely distributed species, including the Leatherback Turtle (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><em><strong>Justification<br/></strong></em>The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy exceeds the thresholds for criterion B, and the population size exceeds the thresholds for criteria C and D. Regarding criterion A, trends were estimated on time series datasets with ≥10 years of data of nesting activities (nest counts) at 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations out of 10 (North West Atlantic, Mediterranean, South West Atlantic, North West Indian, South West Indian, North Pacific). These six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current annual nests globally (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). The analysis revealed different trends for different subpopulations, with an overall -47% population decrease relative to population size three generations ago, which qualifies for the Vulnerable category (under criterion A2). The species trend at a global scale is basically determined by the two most abundant subpopulations, the North West Atlantic and the North West Indian, which altogether comprise about 75% of the current annual nests. They showed positive and negative trends, respectively. The other four subpopulations for which trends could be calculated show positive trends. For the remaining four subpopulations (comprising about 10% of the current annual nests; North East Atlantic, North East Indian, South East Indian, South Pacific), current trends are unclear, however past negative trends are known or suspected at least for the South Pacific and the North East Atlantic subpopulations respectively.<br/>&#160;<br/>The overall scenario suggests that, on the basis of the current knowledge, the extinction of the species at the global level is highly unlikely to occur in the short and medium term. However, the global status of the species in terms of distribution, number of subpopulations, genetic variability, regional ecological roles, and vulnerability, could change dramatically from the past and current situations. For this reason, the global assessment cannot be considered as an indicator of the true conservation status of the species, and priority should be given to the subpopulation assessments.<br/><br/><em><strong>Assessment Procedure:</strong></em><br/><u>Criterion A</u><br/>For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (National Research Council 2010).<br/><br/>To apply criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of the Loggerhead, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 45 years (see the Habitats and Ecology section below). For criterion A, data from three generations ago (~135 years) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e., assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtles—with generation lengths of 30 years or more—are obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for a review). Abundance data from ~135 years ago are not available for Loggerheads anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations ago (~135 years, one generation estimated 45 years; see Habitats and Ecology section below) was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation. A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another sea turtle species, the Leatherback Turtle (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013) and of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply criterion A we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations. For the Loggerhead global and subpopulation assessments we only considered time series datasets of ≥10 years.<br/><br/>For the global Loggerhead population, we considered time series datasets of 10-50 years, from 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations (see the individual subpopulation assessments). The index nesting sites included in the analysis are assumed to be representative of their subpopulations, and these six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current total annual nests (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>The assessment under criterion A was conducted in three steps, as follows. Please see the separate subpopulation assessments for further details.<br/><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> We estimated past trends for each of the six individual subpopulations. Specifically, from one past and one recent abundance values (each representing the annual average of five year nest counts) we calculated overall trends (past-present) for each index nesting sites within subpopulations, and then we calculated overall subpopulation past trends for each subpopulation (criteria A1-A2).</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The past and present total abundance values of the six subpopulations (obtained from Step 2) were summed and from these totals the overall population change (past-present) was calculated (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material). </li></ul>Five of the above six subpopulations showed positive trends and one showed a negative trend. Altogether, they showed a negative trend (-47%). The overall negative trend depended on the negative trend of one subpopulation (North West Indian) where criterion A2 was appropriate – i.e. the causes of reduction may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible. Therefore, the overall trend of the six subpopulations was assessed against criterion A2. The past estimated trend was above the threshold for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 (30% decline) but below the threshold for the Endangered category (50% decline). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle qualifies for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 and the applicable subcriterion is (b), an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (counts of nests or tracks).<br/><br/>Although these trends consider only 6 of 10 subpopulations, these subpopulations with sufficient available data account for about 90% of the current global population abundance (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, these trends likely reflect the complete global trend and represent the best information available about the global population trend. Similarly, the global Leatherback Turtle assessment used only five of seven subpopulations to estimate global trends due to lack of sufficient data for two subpopulations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><u>Criterion B</u><br/>Since the population area extends over entire oceans around the world, the extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the threatened category threshold (20,000 km²). The area of occupancy (AOO) for sea turtles is identified with the nesting beach habitat, which represents the smallest habitat for a critic life stage. Since the appropriate scale for AOO is a grid 2x2 km, the threshold of 2,000 km² corresponds to 1,000 km of linear coastal tract, which is easily exceeded (by orders of magnitude) by the total length of nesting beaches globally. In conclusion, the global population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion B.<br/><br/><u>Criterion C</u><br/>To apply criterion C, the number of adults is needed and can be derived from the number of nests per year with the following formula:&#160; Adults = Nests * Nests per female<sup>-1</sup> * Remigration interval * Female proportion<sup>-1</sup>. With a current estimate of annual number of nests of about 200,000, for any reasonable value of the other parameters the population would easily exceed the threshold of 10,000 adults required to qualify for a threatened category under criterion C.<br/><br/><u>Criterion D</u><br/>The number of mature individuals (see criterion C) and AOO value (see criterion B) exceeded the respective thresholds. In conclusion, the population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion D.<br/><br/><u>Criterion E</u><br/>Although population viability analyses (PVA) were attempted at subpopulation level (Conant <em>et al</em>. 2009, Van Houtan 2011), in most cases they were not suitable for criterion E under this assessment. No PVA has been attempted at species level and such an approach would also be questionable because the subpopulations are independent units by definition.<br/><br/><strong><em>Sources of Uncertainty</em></strong><br/>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (National Research Council 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (National Research Council 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Loggerheads, including age at maturity, generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, remigration intervals, etc.). These values can vary within and among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends. However, we have reduced this source of uncertainty by using in the analyses those data sets obtained though standardized monitoring.<br/><br/>For the trend analyses (criterion A) we used data from index rookeries from six populations out of 10. Possible negative past trends associated to high past abundances in the other four subpopulations not included in the analysis could have changed the final result of the assessment (past trends, criterion A2), if such information was available.<br/><br/>For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).","The Loggerhead Turtle nests on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the temperate and subtropical regions worldwide. Like most sea turtles, Loggerhead Turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (Bolten and Witherington 2003). Upon leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Bolten and Witherington 2003, Putman and Mansfield 2015). After 4-19 years in the oceanic zone, Loggerheads recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in benthic prey or epipelagic prey where they forage and grow until maturity at 10–39 years (Avens and Snover 2013). Upon attaining sexual maturity Loggerhead Turtles undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas at remigration intervals of one to several years with a mean of 2.5–3 years for females (Schroeder <em>et al</em>. 2003) while males would have a shorter remigration interval (e.g., Hays <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wibbels <em>et al</em>. 1990). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Plotkin 2003). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (Bolten and Witherington 2003).<br/><br/><strong><em>Generation length</em></strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population (i.e., older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual) and care should be taken to avoid underestimation (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Although different subpopulations may have different generation length, since this information is limited we adopted the same value for all the subpopulations, taking care to avoid underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).<br/><br/>Loggerheads attain maturity at 10-39 years (Avens and Snover 2013), and we considered here 30 years to be equal or greater than the average age at maturity. Data on reproductive longevity in Loggerheads are limited, but are becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches. Tagging studies have documented reproductive histories up to 28 years in the North Western Atlantic Ocean (Mote Marine Laboratory, unpubl. data), up to 18 years in the South Western Indian Ocean (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013), up to 32 years in the South Western Atlantic Ocean (Projeto Tamar unpubl. data), and up to 37 years in the South Western Pacific Ocean, where females nesting for 20-25 years are common (C. Limpus, pers. comm). We considered 15 years to be equal or greater than the average reproductive longevity. Therefore, we considered here 45 years to be equal or greater than the average generation length, therefore avoiding underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).","Threats to Loggerheads vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Loggerheads, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011) as:<br/><ol><li>Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;</li><li>Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e., consumption, commercial products);</li><li>Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc;</li><li>Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e., through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (for example fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;</li><li>Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).</li><li>The relative impacts of individual threats to all Loggerhead subpopulations were assessed by by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Loggerheads globally, followed by coastal development and human consumption of eggs, meat, or other products. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Loggerheads—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts. </li></ol>More detailed information at regional level can found in the specific subpopulation assessments.","Loggerheads are a single species globally comprising 10 biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) – hereafter subpopulations - which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. Regional management units are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are 10 Loggerhead subpopulations: NorthWest Atlantic Ocean, North East Atlantic Ocean, South West Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North East Indian Ocean, North West Indian Ocean, South East Indian Ocean, South West Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010)  (shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).<br/><br/>Total population size is unknown. The most common proxy for population abundance in sea turtles is the annual number of nests. A total of about 200,000 clutches are laid annually by the 10 subpopulations altogether (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Considering a range of 3 to 5.5 clutches per female, the above value would correspond to approximately 36,000-67,000 nesting females annually.",Decreasing,"The Loggerhead Turtle is globally distributed throughout the subtropical and temperate regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).","Loggerhead Turtles and their eggs are taken for human use (i.e., consumption and commercial products).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Loggerhead Turtles are afforded legislative protection under a number of treaties and laws (Wold 2002). Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).

In regard to incidental take, the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices has proved to be beneficial in some areas, primarily in the United States and South and Central America (National Research Council 1990). Guidelines are available to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations in coastal and high seas fisheries (FAO 2009). However, despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world. In most areas, the lack of effective monitoring in pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the supporting ecosystems of long-lived Loggerhead Turtles.<br/><br/>More detailed information at regional level can be found in the specific subpopulation assessments.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the world’s most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 km²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 km²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5‒15 bears per 1,000 km²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, Frković <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130–220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 km² and 2,200 km² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21‒29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of Gärdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (≈1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It requires very moist microhabitats.","Pollution, particularly of streams, has been observed within the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary due to a very high volume of religious pilgrimage (Wickramasinghe <em>et al. </em>2012), and road expansion to increase access to support pilgrimage to Sri Pada is a future threat. This may accumulate beneath rocks where this species occurs, denying it shelter sites and degrading habitat quality. During pilgrimage season, which lasts about six months, there is a large accumulation of domestic waste and there is also exploitation of the forest (Wickramasinghe<em> et al. </em>2012), and impacts are possible from artificial lighting set up during the pilgrimage season. In addition, illegal gem mining previously occurred on river banks within the forest (although this has ceased following the rediscovery of the site endemic frog <em>Adenomus kandianus</em>). Invasive plant species are also suspected of causing changes to the understorey and canopy cover of the area (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. June 2019). Road construction and the planting of non-native tree species may lead to soil erosion and landslides, making existing habitat unsuitable for this species (Gabadage <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;<em>Polygonum</em>, an invasive shrub found at the top of the mountain and inadvertently spread by pilgrims, is expanding downslope as forest habitat is degraded (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>As a result of these pressures forest is confined to mid-elevations where forest dieback is ongoing, and this may represent the major ongoing threat. Although dieback has been ongoing in this area since at least the 1990s there are no signs of natural forest recovery in affected areas, where invasive shrubs often replace natural vegetation. The causes of dieback remain poorly-understood but have been linked to lead pollution - Ranasinghe <em>et al.</em> (2009). As a high elevation species restricted to moist microhabitats, drought resulting from climate change is a likely threat. There is no immediate encroachment from settlement (which is concentrated at lower elevations), but limited expansion of facilities such as cafeterias and resting places along designated pilgrimage routes to the peaks will increase disturbance. Logging, mainly for firewood, was a major impact on the area several decades ago, but is now banned and gas has replaced firewood as fuel. M. Wickramasinghe (pers. comm. 2019) reports, however, that illegal tree felling to convert forest to tea plantations remains ongoing. The species may occur away from the pilgrimage route in areas of Peak Wilderness that have not been surveyed (D. Gabadage pers. comm. 2019), but this will not protect it from the impacts of dieback, climate change or invasive vegetation.<br/><br/>A previously planned development, including a helipad and tourist facilities, was prevented in order to preserve the threatened (and previously thought to be extinct) frog <em>A. kandiana</em>, but remains a potential future threat to this area, although it is unclear how likely it is that development will resume.","This species is uncommon (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. 2019). There is no evidence of decline, and the population is ""fairly good"" based on surveys as recently as 2018 (N. Perera and M.

Invasive species control is necessary, but while this has been proposed there is presently insufficient training in distinguishing native from invasive species.

123792204,17978,Pontoporia blainvillei,Vulnerable,A3d,2017,2017-08-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Franciscana qualifies as Vulnerable under Red List criterion A3d because a projected range-wide decline of more than 30% over three generations (36 years, Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) is suspected based on the results of a population simulation analysis (Secchi 2006) using actual and potential levels of mortality in gillnet fisheries (with bycatch defined as exploitation for purposes of applying the criteria, i.e. causal factor “(d)” for criterion A). The rate of decline is probably underestimated because a period of only 25 years was considered and other sources of non-natural mortality, including other fisheries, were not incorporated into the analysis. The causes of the suspected population decline have not ceased. On the contrary, fishing effort has increased, at least in some areas in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian Government established regulations for gillnet fisheries that included maximum allowable net lengths and several categories of no-fishing areas. However, there is evidence that the level of Franciscana mortality in southern and southeastern Brazil remains high. The numbers of Franciscanas killed in Brazil in gillnets and found washed ashore each year remains in the order of several hundred which is not different from the numbers observed in years that preceded the regulations (e.g., Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2016; Cremer <em>et al.</em> 2016, E.R. Secchi, unpubl. data). The bycatch is also high in Uruguay and Argentina, where estimates of annual mortality are a few hundred Franciscanas (Capozzo <em>et al.</em> 2007, Negri <em>et al.</em> 2012, Szephegyi <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/></p>","Although sometimes described as a ‘river dolphin’, the Franciscana does not occur in freshwater habitats. The species is generally found in turbid coastal waters, but also inhabits clear waters as well as marine areas associated with islands and rocky shores (Pinedo <em>et al</em>. 1989, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2009). Franciscanas are found mainly in the marine environment and only occasionally in estuaries (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2009) and one inland bay (Cremer and Simões-Lopes 2008). They are relatively common in the Uruguayan part of the La Plata River estuary (Praderi 1986). Franciscanas are primarily coastal, inhabiting waters beyond the surf zone and out to the 30 or 50 m isobath, depending on the region. For example, in FMAs III and IV they occur in waters up to 50 m deep (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2010), while in FMAs I and II they appear to be restricted to waters inshore of the 25 or 30 m isobath. Franciscana density decreases with distance from the coast, although the rate and degree of the decrease vary according the width of the continental shelf (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, D. Danilewicz, unpub. data).<br/><br/>Franciscanas apparently do not migrate, although seasonal inshore–offshore movements have been documented in some areas (Bordino <em>et al</em>. 1999, Bordino 2002). Movements of 70-90 km along the coastline have been recorded for satellite-tagged individuals in Argentina (Wells <em>et al</em>. 2013). Predation by both large sharks and Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) has been documented (Praderi 1985, Ott and Danilewicz 1996, Santos and Netto 2005).<br/><br/>Franciscanas feed on several species of shallow-water fish (e.g., sciaenids, engraulids, gadids, batrachoids, trichiurids and carangids), cephalopods, and crustaceans (Brownell 1989, Di Beneditto and Ramos 2001, Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2002, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002, Troina <em>et al</em>. 2016). Their coastal marine habitat is typically characterized by continental run-off with high discharge of high-nutrient river flows (e.g., Patos Lagoon [Lagoa dos Patos] in RS and the La Plata River [Río de la Plata] in Argentina and Uruguay). Juvenile sciaenids, the most important prey of Franciscanas, are typically associated with continental runoff and the influence of subtropical shelf waters (Crespo 2009).","The main threat to the species is incidental mortality in gillnet fisheries (there are no reports of direct exploitation of Franciscanas), which has been observed since at least the mid 1960s (Van Erp 1969). In the 1960s, the bycatch in Uruguay alone (at two villages) was as high as 1,500-2,000 animals (Brownell and Ness 1969, Pilleri 1971), but changes in the fisheries’ target species resulted in a significant decrease in the bycatch in the 1980s (Crespo <em>et al.</em> 1986, Praderi 1997). Bycatch estimates in the early 2000s totaled at least 2,900 animals per year in all management stocks combined (e.g., Ott <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b), but these numbers are thought to be underestimated to an unknown extent, primarily due to: (1) captures in other non-monitored types of fisheries (e.g., active gillnetting, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 1997; trawling, Szephegyi <em>et al.</em> 2015); (2) under-reporting of bycatch by fishermen; and (3) dolphins captured sometimes falling from the net during retrieval (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b). Annual bycatch is believed to be higher in FMA III with estimates of 1,300 animals/year (Ott <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b, 2004) and much higher in some years (Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013), followed by FMA IV: 500-800 individuals/year (Bordino and Albareda 2005), FMA II: &gt; 700 /year (Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2002, IWC 2005), and FMA Ib: &gt; 110/year (Di Beneditto 2003). These annual mortality estimates suggest that bycatch levels continue to be unsustainable (Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2012; Crespo <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zerbini <em>et al.</em> 2010, Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/> <br/> Stomach contents of Franciscanas from Rio Grande do Sul have included many kinds of debris: discarded fishing gear such as pieces of nylon net (17% of 36 stomachs), ""cellophane"" (or some other type of synthetic packaging material), and plastic fragments (6%) (Bassoi 1997). This problem has also been reported in northern Argentina, where cellophane, fishing debris, and plastic were found in 45%, 32% and 16% of the examined stomachs, respectively (Bastida <em>et al</em>. 2000, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002). The effects of such debris ingestion on health status of individual Franciscanas have not been assessed, and the subpopulation or population-level implications are uncertain. Debris ingestion is a new threat that did not exist, at least in Uruguay, in the early 1970s (R.L. Brownell, Jr., pers. comm., August 2017).<br/> <br/> Other known or potential threats include various forms of habitat degradation (e.g., overfishing; destruction of the benthic community and bycatch of small sciaenid fish—main Franciscana prey—by trawling; and chemical and acoustic pollution) (e.g., Bassoi and Secchi 2000, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2002, Laílson-Brito <em>et al</em>. 2007, Yogui <em>et al.</em> 2010, Holz 2014).","Based on genetic, morphological, distribution, and population parameters, Secchi <em>et al</em>. (2003a) proposed four provisional management units (Franciscana Management Areas, or FMAs) with the following ranges:&#160; FMA I - coastal waters of Espírito Santo (ES) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) States, Brazil; FMA II - São Paulo (SP), Paraná (PR), and Santa Catarina (SC) States, Brazil; FMA III - coastal waters of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, southern Brazil, and Uruguay; and FMA IV - coastal waters of Argentina, including the provinces of Buenos Aires and Rio Negro (only occasional in as far south as Chubut).<br/><br/>Since the study of Secchi <em>et al</em>. (2003a), new genetic and morphological data have indicated the potential for subpopulation structure throughout the range of the Franciscana (Lázaro <em>et al</em>. 2004; Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010; Véras 2011; Barbato <em>et al</em>. 2012; Costa-Urrutia <em>et al</em>. 2012; Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014; Negri <em>et al</em>. 2015; Gariboldi <em>et al</em>. 2015; Ott <em>et al</em>. 2015), leading to the development of new sub-divisions within each FMA (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, because (1) the degree of differentiation within the various FMAs was highly variable, (2) some studies were based only on mitochondrial DNA data, and (3) there is currently no consensus on threshold levels of gene flow above which management units should be adopted, recent refinements in Franciscana subpopulation structure were limited to regions where the greatest levels of genetic difference were observed (Anonymous 2015). In this sense, FMA I was considered an Evolutionarily Significant Unit and split into two distinct management units (FMA Ia and FMA Ib, Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014), a division also supported by well-known gaps in the distribution of the species, one between SP and RJ and another in ES (Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2012). In addition, the boundary between FMA II and FMA III was moved about 250 km to the north and currently lies at the central coast of SC State (Ott, 2002, Véras 2011, Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ott <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>There is no range-wide abundance estimate for the species, but estimates have been calculated for a portion or the whole of individual FMAs. <br/><ul><li>Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted aerial surveys in ES (FMA Ia) and RJ (FMA Ib) in 2011. No on-effort sightings were recorded in FMA Ia, despite relatively large survey effort, suggesting that the population of Franciscanas in ES is small, a hypothesis further supported by the very low genetic diversity of this stock (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014). Abundance of Franciscanas in FMA Ib was estimated at nearly 2,000 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.46), indicating that this is the smallest and the one with the lowest density among all FMAs for which estimates are available. <br/></li><li>Abundance in FMA II was estimated at 8,500 individuals (CV 0.34) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2010) in 2008/9. This estimate is considered to be biased low because habitat offshore of the 30 m isobath was not surveyed. Within FMA II, there are also abundance estimates for Baia da Babitonga (Babitonga Bay) in SC, where a possibly isolated population of Franciscanas occurs (Cremer <em>et al</em>. 2012). Boat-based line transect surveys estimated 50 animals in the early 2000s (CV 0.29, Cremer and Simões-Lopes 2008) and 55 individuals in 2011 (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2011), indicating no evidence for a change in the number of Franciscanas within Babitonga Bay over a 10-year period.</li><li>Recent surveys in FMA III have been conducted only within the Brazilian portion (RS State) and the estimates were 6,800 (CV 0.32) in 2004 (Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2010) and nearly 10,000 dolphins (CV 0.20) in 2014 (D. Danilewicz <em>et al</em>., unpub. data). Because the survey methods and data analysis between these two estimates differed, it is not appropriate to conclude that the higher estimate in 2014 represents an increase in abundance in RS. Surveys to estimate Franciscana abundance have never been conducted in Uruguay. <br/></li><li>Aerial surveys conducted in Argentina (FMA IV) in 2003-2004 estimated a population of nearly 15,000 individuals (CV 0.42, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010). This estimate is believed to be negatively biased because it was not corrected for perception bias and because density estimated for offshore areas (depths greater than 30 m) was not extrapolated to non-surveyed areas.</li></ul>Population viability analysis using estimates of abundance, fisheries-related incidental mortality, and rates of population growth from the early 2000s suggested that levels of bycatch were not sustainable in all FMAs and that Franciscanas in FMAs II, III and IV would decline by at least 30% in 25 years (Secchi and Fletcher 2004, Secchi 2006). These analyses led to the previous Red List classification of the Franciscana as Vulnerable. The modelling exercise conducted by Secchi and Fletcher (2004) and Secchi (2006) is considered to underestimate the risk of decline of Franciscanas, because estimates of bycatch were believed to be biased low in some areas. In fact, most recent data on bycatch (see the <em>Threats</em> section below) indicate that the numbers caught annually in FMAs II and IV are roughly twice as high (e.g., Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bordino and Albareda 2004, IWC 2005) as the values used in the projections by Secchi (2006). Abundance estimates obtained from the mid 2000s to early 2010s suggest that bycatch levels are still unsustainable in FMAs Ib, II, and IV where the annual removals range from 3-6% of the estimated population sizes (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no estimates of bycatch or abundance for Franciscanas in FMA Ia.",Decreasing,"Franciscanas inhabit shallow coastal waters (and they sporadically enter the estuary of the La Plata River [Rio de la Plata]) of subtropical and temperate regions of the western South Atlantic Ocean (Crespo 2009, Secchi 2014). They are found only along the east coast of South America (Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina), from the northern Golfo San Matias, central Argentina (<em>ca</em> 42°10'S), to Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil (18°25'S) (Siciliano 1994, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species is not distributed continuously throughout its range. Surveys (including beach and aerial surveys, museum specimens, interviews with local people) indicate that Franciscanas are extremely rare or absent in two northern areas: (1) between central and southern Rio de Janeiro State comprising nearly 300 km of coastline and (2) in southern Espírito Santo State comprising approximately 150 km of coastline (Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2002, Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2012). The reasons for these gaps are unclear, but the species’ preference for shallow and productive waters (Brownell 1989, Pinedo <em>et al</em>. 1989, Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2009) suggests that depth and the narrowness of the continental shelf influence habitat selection (Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002).",,Marine,The Franciscana is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

However, they are also encountered frequently several metres away from water. They climb fallen dead tree trunks or boulders jutting out from water for basking during the day. They also emerge from water to forage and to migrate to other water sources. During the height of the dry season they aestivate in the mud in tanks or sand in dried streams.<br/><br/>These soft-shell terrapins inhabit stagnant and slow flowing freshwater habitats, and in brackish waters as well as lagoons, ox-bow lakes, streams, rice fields with water, and canals in cities. They are also kept by some inside wells and temple ponds. The occurrence of <em>Lissemys ceylonensis</em> is sympatric with <em>Melanochelys trijuga thermalis</em> and <em>M. t. parkeri</em>.<br/><br/>This species scavenges on animal corpses far from water bodies, and also preys on frogs, tadpoles, fish, crustaceans, snails, earthworms, insects, carrion and water plants. Deraniyagala (1939) reported on this aspect in detail, including the aggressive nature and habit of delivering a painful bite. However, this varying temperate may be an individual habit. Clutches of 2–5 eggs are observed during the months of January, February and March mainly buried on bunds in a pit about 5–6 cm deep. The eggs are white, nearly spherical, brittle hard-shelled. Clutches usually comprise 2–8 eggs, each measuring 25.0–33.0 mm. A generation length of 20 years is estimated.","The main threat faced by <em>Lissemys ceylonensis</em> is that it is widely harvested in large numbers for food. The flesh is a folk remedy for anaemia (Deraniyagala 1939). It is widely consumed in Sri Lanka despite it being illegal since pre-Christian times (Chandraratne 1997). Eggs and hatchlings are also eaten by the mongoose and Common Water Monitor (<em>Varanus salvator</em>) which frequents egg laying sites. Additionally, long term effects of the wide use of chemical fertiliser, insecticides and herbicides that drain into and contaminate the water bodies where the species inhabit should be investigated, as there is an alarming increase in the rate of kidney diseases among farmers in the dry zone due to the wide use of agricultural chemicals. An increase in the fresh water fishery industry has also meant that <em>L. ceylonensis</em> is at a greater threat of becoming entangled in fishing nets and caught as bycatch.&#160; Gramentz (2009) reported deformities in two soft-shell terrapins from Miriswatta. One of the males had a small hump on the left side of the carapace near the proximal end of the 3rd pleural, the other had a slightly smaller hump around the 4th neural.&#160;During recent surveys, individuals of this species were observed entangled and drowned in fishing nets.&#160;Some fishermen also catch the terrapin using bait and fishing rod (A. de Silva pers. comm. 2019).","<em>Lissemys ceylonensis</em> is found in most of the places inhabited by <em>Melanochelys trijuga thermalis</em>. Field observations by A. de Silva and others and published literature indicate that about 20–30 specimens occur in a 5 x 5 km square area.<br/><br/>It is typically a common species, but is believed to be declining overall, likely over 30% over three generations, which equates to 60 years (A. de Silva pers. comm. 2018).",Decreasing,<em>Lissemys ceylonensis</em> is endemic to Sri Lanka and is widely distributed in all climatic zones up to 600 m above sea level.

The two currently recognized disjunct subspecies on Roti (<em>C. m. mccordi</em> and <em>C. m. roteensis</em>) have decreased from moderately common but restricted in the 1990s (with a total extent of occurrence (EOO) at that time of <em>ca</em>&#160;220 sq. km), to commercially and ecologically extinct at present, and now considered Possibly Extinct in the Wild, CR(PEW) A2acde+B2ab(ii,iv), based on a combination of (a) direct observation, (c) loss of habitat and area of occupancy, (d) documented exploitation, and (e) invasive predatory freshwater fish species, and on a residual area of occupancy (AOO) of &lt;10 sq. km and severely fragmented populations with continuing decline in area of occupancy and number of populations. The subspecies <em>C. m. timorensis</em>&#160;from Timor-Leste (which may represent a separate distinct species)&#160;is assessed as Critically Endangered B1ab(ii,iv) based on an EOO of 90 sq. km and only a single subpopulation. The species was last assessed in 2000 (when it was known only from Roti i.e. the concept excluded subspecies <em>timorensis</em>) as&#160;Critically Endangered A1d, B1+2e (version 2.3).","The habitat of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;consists of small, shallow, eutrophic inland lakes, swamps, marshlands and adjacent agricultural rice paddies and fields (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is reported to be entirely nocturnal, except during wet season rains. Reproductive ecology in the wild is largely unknown; female maturity may occur at about 10-11 years, similar to its Australian congener&#160;<em>Chelodina longicollis</em> (Kennett <em>et al</em>. 2009), giving a generation time estimate of about 15-20 years.&#160;In captivity, female maturity occurs at six years (Kayat and Saragih 2016), while a lifespan of about 30 years has been recorded from a wild specimen kept by local people on Roti (As-singkily, pers. obs.). Average clutch sizes of 12.2 (Maran and Coutard 2003) and 9.9 (Symanksi 2004) eggs have been recorded, with hatchling sizes of 23-29 mm and 25 mm carapace length,&#160;respectively. The diet of <em>C. mccordi</em> is apparently generalized carnivory or piscivory, with little dependence on hard-shelled bivalves or snails (Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Timor-Leste, <em>C. mccordi timorensis</em>&#160;aestivates under dry grass near Lake Iralalaro, exposing individuals to collection and the threat of wildfires (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Local consumption of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em> has historically been minimal. Habitat conversion of appropriate habitat into agricultural rice fields has gradually eliminated much of the species' original habitat; however, the species often utilized these altered habitats. This increased the species' chance of collection for the pet trade and exposed it to the effects of increasing use of agricultural chemicals and pesticides (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Additionally, degradation of wetlands through deforestation and climate change effects further reduce the amount of appropriate habitat for this species. Massive land conversion for agricultural activity has destroyed most of original wetlands on Roti; from 1996 to 2016 Roti has lost 70% of its freshwater area (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). A habitat rehabilitation program is needed to recover the remaining wetlands on Roti.&#160;<br/><br/>The international exotic animal trade has by far been the greatest threat impacting <em>C. mccordi</em>&#160;subpopulations. As a result of its description in 1994 as a restricted endemic species, intense pressure developed from international pet trade demand, resulting in a rapid increase in that trade (Samedi and Iskandar 2000;&#160;Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2006; Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2008). The populations were decimated within five years and the species is now considered commercially and ecologically extinct on Roti. Invasive species, including pigs, dogs, livestock and predatory freshwater fish (Snakehead and Tilapia) have also impacted populations through trampling of nests and predation on hatchlings, severely limiting recruitment even prior to the final overexploitation of adults for the live animal trade.&#160;In Timor-Leste, pollution through garbage dumping and changes to Lake Iralalaro&#160;water levels are also impacting the species (Eisemberg <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;The species is also threatened by dry season fires, as it aestivates under dry grass.","Specimens of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;were collected in large numbers from the populations on Roti from the early 1970s well into the 1990s; field surveys on Roti in 1993 revealed that the main mid-central island population was still reasonably robust but was under pressure due to collection for the international pet trade (Rhodin 1994; Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Since the mid-1990s, all known populations of <em>C. mccordi</em>&#160;on Roti appear to have suffered disastrous population declines of &gt;90% and are now commercially and ecologically extinct (Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008; Ibarrondo 2004; Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2006; As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). Despite many surveys over the last several years, the last known specimens of <em>C. m. mccordi</em> or <em>C. m. roteensis</em> on Roti Island were recorded in 2009 (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data; TCC 2018), and the species may now be locally extirpated. However, some animals have been repatriated to central Roti from captive breeding facilities (D. Gunalen, unpubl. data) and more intensive surveys and trapping efforts are needed before declaring the two Roti subspecies to be Extinct in the Wild; a few isolated individuals may still persist on the island. Interviews with local fishermen in Timor-Leste indicated that as of 2015,&#160;<em>C. m. timorensis</em>&#160;remained relatively common within its very limited range (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Chelodina mccordi mccordi </em>occurs on western Roti Island (= Pulau Rote) in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia and had an original EOO of <em>ca</em>&#160;200 sq. km, but this has now been reduced to an estimated AOO of &lt;10 sq. km, and the taxon is considered Possibly Extinct in the Wild.&#160;<em>Chelodina mccordi roteensis </em>occurs as a disjunct subpopulation on the&#160;Tapuafu Peninsula&#160;of eastern Roti Island, with an original EOO of &lt;20 sq. km, but now reduced to an estimated AOO of &lt;20 ha in two wetlands, and Possibly Extinct in the Wild.&#160;<em>Chelodina mccordi timorensis</em>&#160;occurs at Lake Iralalaro and surrounding streams in Nino Konis Santana National Park in the Lautém District of Timor-Leste and has&#160;an EOO of <em>ca</em>&#160;90 sq. km&#160;and has only one known subpopulation.","<em>Chelodina mccordi</em> on Roti has been essentially completely extirpated by massive overexploitation for the international exotic animal trade, starting first in the 1970s when it was considered to simply be an isolated population of the widespread&#160;<em>Chelodina novaeguineae, </em>which at that time was believed to occur widely as a single species across&#160;southern Indonesian Papua and Papua New Guinea, as well as northern Australia. Specimens were collected and exported from Roti since it was easy and legal to collect and export them from there rather than from the other areas of distribution, where collecting and export were either illegal or difficult. Major acceleration and focused exploitation of the Roti populations started in the mid-1990s after the description of <em>C. mccordi</em> as a new restricted endemic species (Rhodin 1994), leading eventually to its commercial and ecological extinction on Roti (Samedi and Iskandar 2000; Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008; Ibarrondo 2004; Shepherd and Ibarrondo 2005; Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2006). The presence of <em>C. mccordi timorensis</em> in Timor-Leste was not discovered and described until 2007. Interviews in Timor-Leste in 2015 indicated that it&#160;did not appear to being internationally traded there at that time (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016), but it has previously appeared in the pet trade.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;has beeen listed in CITES Appendix II&#160;since January 2005, with a zero export quota for Indonesia for specimens from the wild since June 2013. The Turtle Conservation Coalition (2011, 2018) has identified the species as one of its top conservation priorities and has twice listed it as one of the Top 25+ turtles most likely to face extinction in the near future.&#160;The Turtle Survival Alliance, European Studbook Foundation, Turtle Conservancy, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, and Nordens Ark have all targeted <em>C. mccordi</em> for <em>ex situ</em> captive breeding efforts, and various assurance colonies have been established in the US, Europe, and Singapore, with good ongoing results and successful captive breeding (Zwartepoorte 2005; Burke 2006). A new captive breeding facility is being set up in Indonesian Timor, close to Roti (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). Indonesia has legally restricted the trade of <em>C. mccordi</em> since 1997, but enforcement has been virtually non-existent; all exports of wild animals since 2002 have been illegal. However, Indonesia provides legal export permits for specimens claimed to have originated from captive breeding facilities, and one such facility operates on Java. <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;is listed as a protected species in Indonesia according to a new decree of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (no. P20/2018); it was previously listed as <em>C. novaeguineae</em> before its description as a new species. Reintroduction of this species to Roti within well-protected areas will be required if populations are to persist there; areas of suitable habitat are being considered for protected area status (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data), although at present there are no protected areas on Roti (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160;Further studies into the ecology and conservation biology of the species is urgently needed and development of an action plan to carry out intensive surveys for possible remnant populations and establishing repatriation protocols and protected areas.

This species is sympatric to <em>Lucifuga dentata</em> across most of its distribution range probably as a result of <em>L. dentata</em> dispersal from Matanzas to the west. Genetic diversity is very low. Existing threats include saltwater inundation associated with extensive water use, introduced and translocated species, agricultural and industrial pollution, solid waste pollution, and competition with <em>L. dentata</em>. While the direct impacts of these threats have not been quantified, they are inferred to be producing continuous declines &#160;in habitat quality and availability, the number of subpopulations, and the number of mature individuals.

This cryptic, troglobitic cusk-eel is the species typical of the genus and occurs in karst systems of Artemisa and Mayabeque provinces in western Cuba to a depth of approximately 30 meters (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Trajano 2001). It occurs primarily in flooded caves that are connected to surface influences through sinkholes and natural wells (Eigenmann 1909). These caves typically exhibit lentic conditions with translucent waters that are high in magnesium and salts from lime dissolution (Eigenmann 1909). The cave environment is characterized by stable seasonal abiotic conditions and temperatures of approximately 25 °C (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).<em> </em>The water level remains almost unchanged throughout the year (Eigenmann 1909). However, in recent decades, drastic fluctuations in the water table have been observed (e.g. Cueva El Tunel) as a consequence of dry periods and intense water use for agriculture and human consumption.<em> </em>The diet of this opportunistic forager is comprised largely of crustaceans, including troglobitic shrimps but probably also mysid shrimps, amphipods, isopods, and insects (Eigenmann 1909). This species is often found sympatrically with the congener <em>L. dentata</em> (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The habitat that this species occupies is highly susceptible to abiotic alterations (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Specific life history data for this species are lacking, but &#160;reproduction is likely characterized by low fecundity and a long generation length (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. are viviparous, and several pregnant females of <em>L. subterranea</em> bearing 2-15 embryos were analyzed by Eigenmann (1909). In some cases, the young size was 2.0-2.5 cm in length. No breeding season is known for this species although March to May was suggested as most probable (Eigenmann 1909). Maximum reported body size is 8.95 cm standard length (SL) (Hernández <em>et al</em>. 2020).</p>  <p>Surface fish species have been introduced into or have naturally invaded some localities of Artemisa and Agramonte regions. <em>Girardinus metallicus</em> was reported at Ashton early last century (Eigenmann 1909), while <em>Xiphophorus</em>, <em>Poecilia</em>, and <em>Plecostomus</em> sp. have also been observed.</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>The primary threats to this species include the intensive use of subterranean water, the introduction of non-native species, contamination with domestic and non-degradable solid wastes (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Hernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Galford&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), and increased instances of industrial pollutants (Sosa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Guzmán-Morales&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), which have the potential to drastically alter subterranean habitat stability with only small changes in abiotic conditions (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). These threats are producing estimated continuous declines in the number of mature individuals and the number of subpopulations, and inferred continuous declines in habitat quality and availability.</p>  <p>Solid waste pollution (e.g., nylon and polystyrene tires) and translocated Poeciliids have been documented within the Aston Cave system and Luis Piedra Cave, which accounts for several collection localities (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). </p>  <p>Saltwater inundation of karst aquifers resulting from rising sea level, land subsidence, and aquifer overdrafts is likely to have affected several caves occupied by this species and its close congeners. Ground and surface water extraction for agricultural and domestic use has resulted in the salinization of many of Cuba’s karst aquifers (Castillo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Specific examples of salinization are apparent in the Güira-Quivicán basin (e.g. Cajio region where the type locality of <em>L. subterranean </em>occurs) on the southern plane of Havana (Castillo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Similar impacts are attributed to tobacco agriculture in Artemisa Province (Ricote Jorge&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p><br/><p></p>","<p>Total population size has not been estimated but is suspected to be small, given a restricted geographic range and low reported abundances in visual censuses (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Early last century 156 (82 female and 74 males) specimens were sampled between March 1902 and June 1905 (Eigenmann 1909). About 50 more have been sampled during the latest decades (Hernández <em>et al</em>. 2020). Population trend is unknown. Genetic diversity within existing subpopulations suggests limited genetic exchange and small effective population sizes (García-Machado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Previous visual surveys suggest that this species accounts for a smaller proportion of relative abundance when compared to its sympatric congener <em>L. dentata</em> (Ponce de León García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Successive collections at a single locality over a few months resulted in diminishing returns, which suggests that populations are highly susceptible to short periods of rapid decline and that immigration from underground habitat not subject to sampling effort is limited (Eigenmann 1909). The highest reported abundances of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. seem to occur in caves with large colonies of bats, where food resources are relatively high (García-Debrás and Pérez 1999), though some relationship with the twilight zones of cave entrances has also been suggested (Eigenmann 1909).</p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Lucifuga subterranea</em> has the second largest geographic distribution among the Cuban species of the genus.

Total known extent of occurrence is 41 km<sup>2</sup>. The iguana and its eggs are harvested heavily and sold both locally and on the adjacent mainland. Other primary threats to the population are habitat loss and fragmentation associated with development for tourism; decreasing quality of habitat from introduced invasive vegetation and degradation of nesting habitat due to local and oceanic pollution. The population is currently thought to be declining due to the above threats.","The Útila Spiny-tailed Iguana is found primarily in mangrove forests and vegetated sandy shores, though occasionally they can be found in disturbed areas such as coastal/beachfront developments and gardens. They are typically most active during the morning, when adults can be seen basking from 0–15 m above ground in Black (<em>Avicennia germinans</em>), White (<em>Laguncularia racemose</em>), and Red (<em>Rhizophora mangle</em>) Mangrove trees, as well as on the ground. Individuals are commonly observed hiding in the hollows of Black and White Mangrove trees, which they use as retreats. Juveniles occur in both small and large mangrove trees, on the mangrove forest floor, and within coastal beach vegetation shortly after hatching (Schulte and Köhler 2010, D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017). This iguana makes special use of mangrove roots and lagoons by diving into them and swimming or submerging themselves to avoid predation (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017).<br/><br/>The main breeding season occurs from January to late July and mating occurs on or near the ground in the mangrove forests. Females then migrate from the mangroves to beachfronts to nest in a variety of areas, including those with full sun exposure, under piles of leaf litter and oceanic litter, beneath large beachfront trees, and within short shrub vegetation (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017). Nesting takes place from February to August. Females lay an average of 11 to 16 eggs in nests that can be up to a few metres long but not more than 60 cm deep (Gutsche 2006, D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017). Double-clutching has been observed in some individuals. The incubation period is approximately 85 days and hatching occurs from April through October. Upon emerging, hatchlings seem to spend little time inhabiting coastal vegetation before dispersing into the mangrove forests, where they are active on the ground, volcanic coralline rocks, and on the branches of trees as they mature (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017).","The primary threat to the Útila Spiny-tailed Iguana is habitat loss due to mangrove degradation, deforestation, and fragmentation attributable to infrastructure development for the tourism industry. Mangrove forest habitats are used as garbage dumping sites, and there is a potential risk posed by water contamination from terrestrial landfills and agricultural chemicals (fertilisers and pesticides). Oceanic and local pollution (plastics, polystyrene, etc.) covers sandy beaches, affecting prime nesting sites by obscuring laying sites and also potentially affecting sand and incubation temperatures (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017). There is extensive deforestation of mangrove habitat for housing and marina construction, and for future potential crop plantations. Mangroves near developed areas and roads are also becoming isolated from their water sources, causing the trees to die and leaving large patches of dead mangrove in dry lagoons. Natural beach habitat is being lost through the removal of vegetation in preparation for development. This coupled with the introduction of invasive alien plants is making beach habitat increasingly unsuitable for egg laying. Cattle have been observed trampling over nests; with expanding agriculture this may become a more prevalent threat in the future (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017).<br/><br/>Invasive alien predators such as rats and free-roaming dogs and cats are threats to this iguana. Northern Raccoons (<em>Procyon lotor</em>) were also recently observed and may be a potential concern (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017).<br/><br/>Many native predators of this iguana have been observed and may become out of balance with habitat changes that provides less shelter. Hatchlings in particular are easy prey for: birds, such as Great-tailed Grackle (<em>Quiscalus mexicanus</em>), Common Black Hawk (<em>Buteogallus anthracinus</em>), Great Egret (<em>Ardea alba</em>), and Green Heron (<em>Butorides virescens</em>); snakes, including Salmon-bellied Racer (<em>Mastigodryas melanolomus</em>), Mexican Parrot Snake (<em>Leptophis mexicanus</em>), Mexican Vine Snake (<em>Oxybelis aeneus</em>), Green Vine Snake (<em>Oxybelis fulgidus</em>), and Boa Constrictor (<em>Boa imperator</em>); and lizards, such as Brown Basilisk (<em>Basiliscus vittatus</em>) and Common Spiny-tailed Iguana (<em>Ctenosaura similis</em>) (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017). The Common Black Hawk, Great Egret, and Boa Constrictor have been observed to prey on adults as well (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017).<br/><br/>The wide-ranging Common Spiny-tailed Iguana (<em>Ctenosaura similis</em>) is also native to the island but primarily occupies a different habitat niche than <em>C. bakeri</em>. This iguana is capable of hybridizing with the endemic Útila Spiny-tailed Iguana in areas of habitat overlap. Although this is currently occurring too infrequently to greatly threaten this species, hybridization could become a greater problem with increasing habitat destruction (Pasachnik <em>et al</em>. 2009). An updated genetic analysis is currently in progress.","The total population size is unknown but analyses are currently underway and it is likely to be less than 6,000 individuals (D. Maryon and D. Lee unpublished data 2017). Although more rigorous data are needed, observations suggest the population has continually declined in association with increased habitat degradation and destruction over the last 15 years. The population has also been severely affected by harvesting for human consumption (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017). Effects of this practice are exacerbated by hunters specifically targeting gravid females, and thus dramatically impacting annual reproduction rates. Genetic variation in the population does not follow a specific geographic pattern indicating that this iguana appears to have been mating randomly across the island (Pasachnik <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, with ever-increasing habitat loss, further fragmentation of local subpopulations appears imminent, and a reassessment is currently underway to establish whether these subpopulations are becoming genetically isolated.",Decreasing,"The Útila Spiny-tailed Iguana is known only from the island of Útila, Bay Islands, Honduras. The extent of occurrence is 41 km<sup>2</sup>. However, suitable mangrove habitat available for <em>Ctenosaura bakeri</em> estimated at less than 8 km<sup>2</sup> (D. Maryon, D. Lee and E. Higgins unpublished data 2017). This iguana occurs from sea level up to 20 m asl.","Iguanas and their eggs continue to be sought for human consumption year-round and are sold both locally and on the adjacent mainland. Groups of hunters with dogs are reported in mangrove habitats between February and May (D. Maryon pers. obs. 2017), coinciding with the presence of gravid females which are often selectively targeted. Females containing eggs are cooked and eaten as a traditional cultural delicacy, especially throughout the Easter period. From 2006 to 2011, the sex ratio of iguanas became increasingly more male-biased, which may be indicative of increasing hunting pressure on adult females (Pasachnik <em>et al</em>. 2012).",Terrestrial,"The Útila Spiny-tailed Iguana is protected by Honduran law through a ban on hunting, in place since 1994, however, actual enforcement of this law is inadequate. The iguana is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Two local organizations, Kanahau Útila Research and Conservation Facility (Kanahau URCF) established in 2012, and the Útila Iguana Research and Breeding Station (IRBS) established in 1997, work to protect the species through raising awareness in local communities.<br/><br/>Currently, Kanahau URCF and the University of South Wales, United Kingdom, are conducting population, behavioural, and genetic studies on the iguana across the island. This research aims to locate important migration routes of gravid females across the island, identify nesting areas, and assess the size, structure, and current rate of hybridization of the population. All signs of hunting and habitat destruction are recorded. Questionnaires among the local community are used to determine harvesting rates and perceptions of iguanas. An environmental education program in local schools run by Kanahau URCF, in conjunction with the Bay Island Conservation Association and the Útila Whale Shark Oceanic Research Centre, focuses on environment awareness and includes presentations on biology and conservation of the Útila Spiny-tailed Iguanas, their habitats, and other natural resources.<br/><br/>The Útila IRBS has been run by a local non-government organization, The Bay Island Foundation, since 2008. The foundation coordinates a breeding program with captive and wild female iguanas. Captive-hatched juveniles are released on the beaches where the females were captured and in other suitable areas. To date, the survival rate of these released iguanas has not been documented.<br/><br/>Recommended conservation measures include active management and protection of the wild iguana population and their habitats. It is critical that local authorities be supported and encouraged to enforce existing legislation, and prosecute individuals caught hunting or selling iguanas to send a strong local message. Protected areas should be created that include mangrove, coastal nesting habitats, and migration routes to ensure year-round refuge. Given that the entire island is currently under private ownership (with the exception of Turtle Harbour Wildlife Refuge), suitable habitat areas may need to be privately purchased and designated as a reserve. Education of both locals and tourists about the iguana is also crucial for long-term survival. These programs should highlight the endangered status of the species, an understanding of its legal protection, and the environmental and economic benefits of protecting the iguana and its habitat. Environmental tours should be developed to raise tourist’s awareness of iguanas and their fragile ecosystem, which could provide an alternative livelihood to local people.&#160;<br/><br/>Research needs include: 1) continued monitoring of population and habitat trends; 2) further investigation of breeding behaviour and requirements; 3) habitat classification and quantification of the scale and rates of degradation, deforestation, and fragmentation across the entire island; 4) quantifying other potential threats; and 5) a detailed study of the effects of human harvesting.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It is also known from the Philippines (Field Museum 2011). In the Southern Hemisphere, three strandings have been reported in eastern Australia and two in New Zealand, but in all of these cases the identification needs to be confirmed.

The recent recognition of the very similar and largely sympatric <em>M. hotaula</em> as a separate species calls into question whether <em>M. ginkgodens</em> occurs in the Indian Ocean at all (Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2012). <em>M. hotuala</em> was originally described from a stranding in Sri Lanka (Deraniyagala 1963a, b), but a short time later it was synonymized (incorrectly) with <em>M. ginkgodens</em> (Moore and Gilmore 1965). Since then, Sri Lanka has continued to be listed as a range state for <em>M. ginkgodens</em> (<em>e.g</em>., Mead 1989, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Specimens reported as <em>M. ginkgodens</em> from China were reidentified as <em>M. densirostris</em> (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Throughout its range, the species' population has been heavily impacted by illegal collection for meat consumption and for its skin. Given that the area where it occurs coincides with the highest human population densities in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, habitat loss, degradation, and trade are major threats to the species. Overall, it is suspected that the population of the species has declined between 50–60% during the last three generations, and it is therefore listed as Endangered.","This species is found in a number of humid habitats, including riverbanks, canals and rice fields, but predominantly in marshland (Visser&#160;2004). It is absent from dry grassland or hot steppe, areas in which it has erroneously been assumed to occur (Visser 2004). It is mainly terrestrial, but is largely aquatic between June and October in the monsoon season (Visser 2004). In the dry season animals (between November and February) to its own burrows, termite mounds or crevices and cracks in the earth (Visser 2004). Its diet is known to include amphibian, reptile and bird eggs, insects and rodents (Visser 2004). They also are specialized for feeding on crabs. Animals of both sexes become sexually mature between their third and fourth year and females produce a single clutch (Visser 2004). Clutches of 4 to 30 eggs (mean 16) are laid in burrows in elevated areas between July and October (Visser 1985, Bennett 1988, Visser 2004). The length of the incubation period is 155 days at temperatures of &gt;30°, however, can last more to 250 days if temperatures are 30°C and less (Auliya and Koch 2020).<br/><br/>Sexual maturity in both males and females is estimated at 3.5 years (range 2.5–4 yrs )and longevity in captivity is 10.6 years (Schleich and Kastle 2002). Assuming that animals in the wild may live less than in captivity, nine years is used in the estimation of generation length. Using the formula: age of first reproduction + (z * length of reproductive period), generation length is estimated at 5.7 years [3.5 + (0.4 * 5.5)]","The Gangetic River basin where this species occurs coincides with the highest human population densities in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Throughout its range, the species is heavily exploited for its skin and meat. It is also used along with other monitor lizards in traditional medicine (Shah and Tiwari 2004). Recreational killing in combination with persecution is also a major threat in both India and Nepal (Das 1988, Ghimire and Shah 2014). In India, one of the popular ways of hunting this species is by using dogs (A. Das pers. comm. 2019). Juveniles of the species are often predated by subsidized predators, such as domestic cats (A. Das pers. comm. 2019). The eggs are also consumed when found.&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The species is also hunted during popular hunting festivals in West Bengal (Bhattacharya <em>et al.</em> 2019).</span><br/><br/>Although this species has been reported from agricultural areas, mechanized agricultural practices, using heavy machinery, threaten subpopulations living in marginal habitats. In Bangladesh, agricultural activities are causing the degradation of breeding habitats (K. Hasan pers. comm. 2019). <br/><br/>It is frequently found in road kills (P. Mohapatra pers. comm. 2019). <br/><br/>The species is largely confined to marshy and wetland habitats, which are under severe pressure from encroachment, land filling, and pollution (A.

In Nepal it is restricted to small patches of habitat as a result of habitat encroachment, poaching and persecution (Karki and Bista 2008, Khatiwada and Ghimire 2009, Ghimire and Shah 2014).","There are no current data on population size and trends for this species. It is uncommon compared with the other monitor lizards in its range. The population is likely decreasing, mainly due to exploitation. In Bangladesh, the main reason for population decline is likely to be degradation of its breeding habitat. It is suspected that the population of the species has declined between 50–60% during the last three generations (17–18 years).",Decreasing,"This species is confined to, and has a wide range on, the Indo-Gangetic Plain south of the Himalayas in eastern Pakistan (Rawalpindi, Multan, Sukkhur, Hyderabad, Sind Khan 1999), northern India, Nepal, south central Bhutan, and Bangladesh.

An example of this is in the River Chagharzi where it is thought to be declining in part due to marble factory discharge that is affecting gills of the fish and has destroyed spawning and feeding grounds (Akhtar<em> et al.</em> 2015). High levels of HCHs and DDTs were also found in individuals from the Kabul River, which was likely due to agricultural runoff in the catchment area (Aamir <em>et al.</em> 2016). High levels of heavy metals have also been found in District Charsadda, likely from untreated industrial and domestic household effluents (Idrees<em> et al.</em> 2017).

As a result of this research, reforestation nurseries have been started ready for replanting. Work in local communities has involved sustainable income development through the support of textile trading and development of tourism infrastructure, along with improved medical provision (MacLeod 2009). <br/><br/>As part of BirdLife's Preventing Extinctions Programme a number of actions are being implemented through Species Guardian Isabel Gómez (Asociación Armonía: BirdLife in Bolivia): research on the species's status and distribution has been carried out, including collating all known published and unpublished records as well as spatial modelling and on-the-ground surveys, followed by a second phase of fieldwork to study the species's reproductive biology, territory size, habitat use and movements; a socioeconomic study has been carried out for two local communities; a National Strategy for conservation of <em>Polylepis </em>forest has been developed; a workshop to determine human impacts on <em>Polylepis </em>forests and formulate the possible solutions at the regional level was held which involved the Vice-ministry of Biodiversity, Forestry Resources and Environment as well as members of local communities; and environmental education workshops have been held in three local schools to raise awareness of the birds that live in the <em>Polylepis </em>forest and importance of their conservation.

In the Cordillera Vilcanota, prioritise habitat restoration efforts at five localities - Mantanay, Pumahuanca, Abra Málaga, Yanacocha and Cancha-Cancha. Habitat restoration strategies should focus on patch size maintenance/enlargement, enhancement of within-patch habitat quality, and efforts to safeguard connectivity of suitable habitat. Management of habitat quality in remnant patches should focus on maintaining necessary conditions for resource partitioning amongst insectivorous guilds, which dominate the threatened <em>Polylepis</em> bird community. Improve traditional land-use management by segregating agricultural, grazing and forest areas. Expand <em>Polylepis</em> planting programmes and plant buffer zones below <em>Polylepis</em> woodland to provide an alternative firewood source. Evaluate conservation problems and socioeconomic issues. Encourage local people to develop land-use management and restoration schemes (Fjeldså and Kessler 1996).

With the motorisation of artisanal canoes by outboard motors in the late 1950s and early 1960s came expansion of fishing range, use of ice and freezer vessels.  Various sophisticated gears including purse seine and trawls evolved with time in response to the growing industry.  The semi-industrial industry evolved using locally built wooden hulled vessels with inboard engines and later came the imported steel hulled vessels.  Fishermen began to migrate to settle in nations during lean seasons in search of fish stocks as well as vessels from one country fished in the waters of other countries under traditional agreements in the early 1970s.  With the coming into force of exclusive economic zones (EEZ) for various countries, the range of many fleets became limited to that of their nations.  In the late 1990s, the numbers of trawlers almost doubled in most of the nations in response to the profitability of the industry.  However, it was not long before catch rates declined and in response pair trawling commenced around 2005.<br/><br/>Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana and Cameroon have the largest fleets in the West African region.  In Ghana the sciaenids are exploited by by the artisanal, semi-industrial and industrial fishing sub-sectors.  According to a 2006 survey, there are about 11,213 canoes in the artisanal sector, 230 locally built wooden hulled vessels (using trawls and purse seines) in the semi-industrial sector and 100 industrial vessels out of which 64 are trawlers.","<em>Umbrina steindachneri</em>&#160;is considered a rare species and is one of the least abundant sciaenids observed in Ghana (F. Nunoo pers. comm., Schneider 1990). Records from RV Fridjoft Nansen survey for all sciaenids in the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem (GCLME) from 2000 to 2006 show a reduction in biomass from 1,046 t to 664 t; this is a 37% reduction in biomass.

Within Europe, it has experienced moderate declines&#160;which have not been compensated for by increases elsewhere in the species' range. Declines are thought to be driven by a range of threats including overharvesting of aquatic resources, pollution, disturbance and hunting. Should the declines be found to be more severe, or new information reveal declines in the <em>S. m. sedentaria</em> and <em>S. m. borealis</em> populations, then the species would warrant uplisting; it almost meets the requirements for listing as threatened under criterion A4abcde.","<p>The Common Eider always nests on the ground, and usually in areas free of mammalian predators (Waltho and Coulson 2015), including coastal islands and islets along low-lying rocky coasts, on coastal shores and spits, on islets in brackish and freshwater lagoons, coastal lakes and rivers or on tundra pools close to the coast (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). They use a wide range of nesting habitats, including bare ground, shingle, grassland, scrub, under trees and in derelict buildings (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The nest is a slight hollow in the ground that is usually positioned in the shelter of rocks or vegetation but may also be in the open (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Large nesting aggregations form where safe nesting sites are at a premium (Waltho and Coulson 2015).</p><p>These species typically moults on shallow marine or sheltered coastal waters free from disturbance (Kear 2005; Waltho and Coulson 2015). It winters on shallow coasts (usually &lt;10m depth), bays and estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Waltho and Coulson 2015), especially where there are high abundances of benthic molluscs,&#160;particularly <em>Mytilus edulis</em> (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015). It may also occur inland on freshwater lakes when on passage and during the winter (rarely) (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Its diet consists predominantly of benthic molluscs,&#160;especially <em>Mytilus edulis</em>, although a wide range of crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and isopods), echinoderms, other marine invertebrates and fish may also be taken (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015). During the breeding season incubating females in the Arctic &#160;are reported to feed on &#160;algae, berries and the seeds and leaves of surrounding tundra plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), while in temperate regions they do not&#160;feed, which leads to the temporary breakdown of their digestive system (Waltho and Coulson 2015, Laursen and Møller 2016), Northern populations of this species are migratory (&gt;1000km), but southern populations are largely sedentary (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Migratory nature is largely a response to coastal sea ice (Waltho and Coulson 2015).<br/></p><p></p>","<p>The critical factor for the long-term survival of the species appears to be the survival rate of young ducklings (Waltho and Coulson 2015), but it is not clear which factors are causing the low duckling survival. Past mass mortality in ducklings has been caused by viral infections (1996, 1999) (Hollmén 2002), and the impact of this is likely aggravated by low availability and low nutritional quality of food supplies which is associated with poor body condition in females at the onset of the breeding season (Desholm <em>et al</em>. 2003). Avian cholera appears to be a potentially significant threat with mass mortality events noted at several colonies in Denmark and in Canada (Kats 2007, Descamps <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tjørnløv <em>et al.</em> 2013), and according to Descamps <em>et al.</em>’s (2012) model, only a few recurrent outbreaks would be sufficient to cause colony extinction within a relatively short time. Other diseases may also impact populations, e.g. Wellfleet Bay Virus has caused heavy mortality in Massachusetts, US (Ballard <em>et al.</em> 2012) but high parasite loads are considered to be a symptom of other detrimental impacts rather than a primary driver of decline (Kats 2007).</p>  <p>Conflict with the shellfish aquaculture industry can have detrimental effects on certain populations (Kear 2005, Ens 2006). Over-harvesting of benthic molluscs has led to mass starvation events in the past, particularly where secondary prey resources are targeted, as with intensive fishing of <em>Spisula</em> clams during a period of low mussel stocks prior to a mass mortality event in 1999-2000 in the Dutch Wadden Sea and southern North Sea (Camphuysen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Ens 2006, Kats 2007). The species is also impacted by the extensive use of gillnets, and commonly becomes entangled and drowned in monofilament nets, and significant mortality may occur where fishing effort overlaps with Eider aggregations (Kear 2005, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Levels of hunting are high within several countries within the range, and have been considered unsustainable in Russia (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006), Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Greenland (where annual bags exceeded 80,000 in the late 1990s) (Merkel 2004). New restrictions introduced in 2004 appear to have enabled populations to recover considerably (Merkel 2010). In North America, the harvest may still exceed sustainable levels in certain areas (Kear 2005).&#160; Populations in the high Arctic are subject to shooting by indigenous peoples for food, especially in spring (Byers and Dickson 2001, Kear 2005), but this subsistence hunting is likely to be sustainable at current levels (Byers and Dickson 2001). An associated threat is that of lethal and sub-lethal lead exposure through ingestion of lead shot by adult birds, with 23% of females dying of emancipation after incubation were diagnosed with severe or sub-clinical lead poisoning (Hollmén 2002), and 22% of birds collected through hunting in Greenland over three years carried embedded shot pellets (Falk <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>The species is vulnerable to chronic coastal oil pollution and to major oil spills especially in areas where large moulting and wintering concentrations occur (Kear 2005, Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015, Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2017). While one major incident has the potential to be disastrous, levels of chronic oil-related mortality appears relatively stable in the southern North Sea and Wadden Sea, at between 4-12% of estimated winter mortality (Camphuysen <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>  <p>Disturbance from the development of mineral resources along the coast (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006) and from local shore-based activities such as angling and dog walking increases the likelihood of predation on young (Keller 1991). Other recreational activities such as boat tours (Burnham <em>et al.</em> 2012), as well as scientific research (Bolduc and Guillemette 2003) are also likely to reduce productivity at certain locations (Keller 1991). In winter, unregulated tourism and shipping also cause disturbance to the species, and may prevent access to favoured feeding grounds (Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>Additional threats include predation of breeding females in Europe by the increased population of White-tailed Eagle <em>Haliaeetus albicilla</em> and nest predation by introduced mink <em>Mustela vison</em> (Kats 2007, Ekroos <em>et al.</em> 2012) and in the Americas by introduced foxes <em>Vulpes</em> spp. (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2015). Increasing incidence of nesting in tight association with gull colonies and in less exposed sites, may reflect antipredator responses.</p>  <p>The species may also be sensitive to the effects of climate change, though assessing the impacts on population dynamics is problematic as negative effects (e.g. lower growth in prey leading to reduced food availability [Carboneras <em>et al.</em> 2012]) are confounded by potential positive impacts deriving from earlier arrival on breeding grounds improving breeding success in some areas (D’Alba <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>  Mussel quality, and subsequent eider breeding condition, increases with higher nutrient content of coastal waters (Laursen and Møller 2014) so recent reductions in the level of eutrophication of near-shore waters may have contributed to lower food availability.&#160; Thiamine deficiency has been linked to a lethal paralytic syndrome that has caused mass mortality of Eider ducklings. Unlike Herring Gulls <em>Larus argentatus</em>, Common Eider females will lay eggs even below the critical threshold of thiamine, with resultant rapid mortality in hatchlings (Balk <em>et al.</em> 2009). The extent to which this impacts the population is unknown, and is unlikely to account for the strongly skewed sex ratio observed in the species (Lehikoinen <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, the causes of lethal thiamine deficiency need further investigation as there may be a widespread pollutant present that is currently unidentified. Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, with potential reverberations up the trophic chain. In the Baltic, the impact is thought to be sufficiently low to not cause declines (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011).<p></p>","<p>The global population is estimated to number c. 3,300,000-4,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2012), which equates to 1,580,000-1,910,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 791,000-955,000 pairs.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The breeding range of this species is widely distributed around the mid- to high-latitude coasts of the northern hemisphere, particularly at the higher latitudes. It has a Holarctic distribution, being present in both Eurasia and North America. However, its distribution is not continuous across the Holarctic. There are distinct and persistent gaps in both the central parts of the Russian Arctic and the Canadian Arctic. The distributional gap in Russia (54° longitude) is considerably wider than that in Canada (6° longitude). These gaps can be attributed to the presence of ice all year round at these locations, especially landfast sea ice. At the highest latitudes, the presence of breeding birds is largely limited by the distribution of ice-free conditions during June.</p><p>In winter, the range is more compressed, with migratory northern populations largely wintering within the range of the southerly sedentary populations (Waltho and Coulson 2015).

Males gather in vast flocks between July and August and undertake moult migrations to favoured marine areas often more than a thousand miles from the breeding grounds (Snow and Perrins 1998; Johnsgard 1978)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The autumn migration to winter quarters, by both males and females), peaks between August and October, with&#160;stragglers still leaving the breeding grounds during September (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The timing of the return passage in the spring is determined by the ice conditions and the thawing of inland breeding waters (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Non-breeding birds generally oversummer south of the breeding range or may remain on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

Two to five percent of the population has been harvested annually in Alaska and Canada in recent years (Powell <em>et al.</em> 2012), accounting for 16,000 individuals (Rothe <em>et al</em>. 2015). Harvesting levels can reach 6.9% in the Northwest Territories (Byers and Dickson 2001), while in south west Greenland there has been an estimate of between 10-20% of the winter population killed annually (Hansen 2002). No data is available for Russia. In one study covering the wintering population in southwest Greenland, 22% of adults carried embedded lead shots (Falk <em>et al.</em> 2006). Lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead have also been detected in related Spectacled Eiders Somateria fischeri in Alaska where they are thought to be reducing survival rates (Grand <em>et al.</em> 1998, Flint <em>et al.</em> 2016). Given their overlapping ranges and similar ecologies, King Eiders are likely to be affected in a similar way.</p>  The species is also vulnerable to mortality from bycatch, with 100-200 individuals killed per year around Nuuk, Greenland. Bycatch of all eider species has been reported in Newfoundland, Iceland, Norway, Germany and the Baltic Sea (Merkel 2004). Oil spills poses an additional threat, a small spill in the Pribilof Islands in 1997 caused high Eider mortality. Should an oil spill occur in the eastern Chukchi Sea, a primary staging area for King Eiders during autumn and spring migrations, it would be expected to cause a population decline of between 2.1-3.4% a year in northern Alaska (Bentzen and Powell 2012). Oil fields have been developed in areas where King Eider nests in northern Alaska, but no decline in numbers has been documented (Powell <em>et al.</em> 2012), with pollution from spills being a greater threat than the disturbance of oil exploration activities and development of platforms. Climate change poses an ongoing and future threat to the species through ocean acidification and habitat shifting. Decreased pH values of seawater may lead to declines in molluscs which are key prey items in eider diets (Steinacher <em>et al</em>. 2009, USFWS 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Remote sensing has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005, Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006) which could constitute breeding habitat loss. However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been demonstrated.

It begins to breed in June, nesting sometimes in single pairs in very low densities (roughly one pair per 100 acres was recorded on the Kashunuk River in the 1960s)<strong></strong> (Johnsgard 1978), but occasionally in small colonies of up to 60+ nests (Kear 2005). Around the time of hatching, males gather in large flocks off the coast near the breeding ground (Johnsgard 1978). Shortly after hatching, the female moves her brood to the coast where they form 'herds' (Johnsgard 1978). The species migrates up to 3000km to its moulting sites (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, where it becomes flightless for a period, before some continue migration to more distant wintering sites (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. The timing of the moult migration appears to be highly variable, occurring sometimes as early as August, but in some years not until November, in which case the moult occurs prior to arrival (Johnsgard 1978). On the moulting grounds it forms flocks that may exceed 50,000 birds (Laubhan and Metzner 1999, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. Congregations of a similar size also occur also in the spring when pair formation occurs prior to departure for the breeding grounds (Kear 2005). Spring migration commences in March in East Asia (Kear 2005). Elsewhere it begins in April, usually peaking in May (Kear 2005).<strong> </strong>Arrivals on the breeding grounds begin in early June (Kear 2005). Some small flocks remain throughout the summer in the wintering quarters at Varangerfjiord (Kear 2005).&#160;<strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em><strong> </strong>This species regularly breeds several kilometres inland (Kear 2005). It inhabits pools of various shapes and sizes in areas that characterise flat coastal belt within open tundra (Kear 2005). In the Lena Delta and Barrow areas it favours moss-lichen polygonal tundra (Kear 2005). It forages in areas of fresh, saline or brackish water, as well as in tidal flats (Johnsgard 1978). Following hatching all birds move to coastal habitats (Johnsgard 1978). <em>Non-breeding </em>It winters mostly at sea, along low-lying rocky coasts, frequenting bays and river mouths<strong> </strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). It forages in water that is less than 10m deep<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>, and particularly favours areas where freshwater streams enter the sea<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>Madge and Burn 1988).<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>Diet </strong>It feeds chiefly on molluscs, crustaceans and other marine invertebrates (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong>. During the breeding season, some freshwater prey is taken including chironomid and caddisfly larvae (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. During moult, bivalve molluscs are the primary food source (Petersen 1981)<strong></strong>.<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> Nests are built on small hummocks or in depressions between hummocks, usually within a few metres of a tundra pond, and are often well-concealed by grass (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. The nests are deep and lined with lichens, grass and down (Kear 2005). <strong> </strong> <p></p>","<p>Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Recent dramatic changes in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness north of Alaska and Russia may affect eiders in unknown ways. In addition, climate change is causing the loss of Arctic tundra ponds (Andresen and Lougheed 2015), which could be contributing to declines in the species. In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Increased predation may also result from climate-related collapses in the pattern of cyclical abundance of rodents, as predators target alternative prey in the absence of their main food (Quakenbush <em>et al.</em> 2004, Iles <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  <p>Habitat loss also occurs through prospecting for, and the exploitation of, natural resources such as oil and gas (Kear 2005). The increasing traffic of tankers carrying oil from Arctic areas imposes the risk of contamination following spills (Kear 2005). There are concerns in Alaska that a road-building project approved by the United States Congress in 2009 may impact the species (Morse 2009). Disease and water pollution may impact eiders in their wintering area in south-west Alaska. It is not currently clear which of these many factors is driving the overall decline (K. Laing <em>in litt</em>. 2004, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>Over-hunting in Siberia and in other breeding areas may be impacting Steller's Eider populations while large numbers may be taken during the spring migration, though data on levels are poor (Pihl 1997). Subsistence hunting has been ongoing in Alaska since the late 19th century and may have affected breeding populations in this area (Fredrickson 2001). Studies at Barrow indicate that the historical and ongoing use of lead shot in hunting causes lead poisoning, despite being made illegal in a nationwide ban in 1991 (Morse 2009). Eiders breeding in Russia are also subject to human subsistence harvest and exposure to lead shot, where declines in the number of wintering birds on Bering Island, Russia appear to be greater on the west coast near the only village on the island; new protective zones are being proposed there (Y. Artukhin <em>per</em> K. Laing <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Males are subject to particular hunting pressure as they arrive on moulting grounds before females (Morse 2009).</p>  <p>Another threat is mortality resulting from bycatch in gillnet fisheries, which has been documented in Lithuanian waters (Dagys and Žydelis 2002) and resource competition from shellfisheries. Redistribution is likely to have reduced bycatch in some areas, but the foraging ecology of the species puts it at risk from bycatch where they overlap with fishing fleets, for example in Estonia (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  Nest predation by mammalian and avian predators such as Arctic Fox <em>Vulpes lagopus</em>, Snowy Owl <em>Nyctea scandiaca</em> and Pomarine Jaeger <em>Stercorarius pomarinus</em> appears to be a threat on Alaskan breeding grounds. No nesting was observed near Barrow between 2001 and 2004, but nesting has since occurred with some success following the inception of fox control in 2005 (Safine 2011). Increasing human habitation of Arctic regions has increased the range and numbers of Ravens <em>Corvus corax</em> and some large gulls, leading to a greater predation pressures (Kear 2005).<p></p>","Various population estimates include: c.10,000-15,000 wintering individuals in north Norway and the south-east Baltic (based on a count of 4,297 off Kola Peninsula in April 2003 [Krasnov <em>et al.</em> 2004], 2,300 in the whole Baltic in 2009 (Skov <em>et al.</em>, 2011) and c.2,700 wintering off Norway in the same year (Aarvak <em>et al.</em> 2012) Ce.100,000-110,000 wintering individuals were counted in the north Pacific; counts in North America declined from 137,900 in 1992 to 77,300 in 2003, forming the basis of the 2003 North American population estimate of 90,000-95,000 individuals (K.

Population trends outside Europe are unknown. Extrapolated over three generation lengths and allowing for uncertainty, the population is thought to be declining at a rate sufficient to be listed as Vulnerable. Should population trends become less uncertain both within and outside its European range it may merit uplisting or downlisting.","The species is exclusively marine, found on rocky coasts and offshore islands (Nettleship <em>et al</em>. 2014). It nests on grassy maritime slopes, sea cliffs and rocky slopes. During the winter it is wide-ranging, found in offshore and pelagic habitats.<br/><br/>The species is a pursuit-diver, catching most of its prey within 30 m of the water surface but&#160;capable of diving to 60 m (Piatt and Nettleship 1985, Burger and Simpson 1986)<sup></sup>. They prey on 'forage' species, including juvenile pelagic fishes, such as herring <em>Clupea harengus</em>, juvenile and adult capelin <em>Mallotus</em> <em>villosus</em>, and sandeel <em>Ammodytes</em> spp. (Barrett <em>et al</em>. 1987)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. At times, they also prey on juvenile demersal fishes, such as gadids; planktonic crustaceans; and polychaete worms (Harris and Hislop 1978, Barrett <em>et al. </em>1987, Martin 1989, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996, Harris <em>et al. </em>2015)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the southern and eastern parts of its range, sandeels usually form the majority of the prey fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973, Hislop and Harris 1985, Harris and Wanless 1986, Martin 1989, Harris and Riddiford 1989).&#160;However, there are exceptions, such as at Skomer Island in 1969 when sprat made up the majority of the diet fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973), and in the Lofoten islands, where first-year herring are often the commonest food of chicks (Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006).<br/><br/>When feeding chicks, birds generally forage within 10 km of their colony, but may range as far as 50 to 100 km or more (Harris 1984,&#160;Anker-Nilssen and Lorentsen 1990,&#160;Rodway and Montevecchi 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. A boat transect run on one day in 1970 found that 85% of all birds seen were concentrated within just 3 km of the colony (BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, but other studies have found peaks in the density of foraging birds at up to 40 km distance from the colony (Webb <em>et al.</em> 1985, Stone <em>et al.</em> 1992, Stone <em>et al. </em>1993, BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Similarly, surveys and GPS tracking at the Isle of May, Scotland, suggest that birds forage close to the breeding colony, but also at other sites up to 40 km away (Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1990, BirdLife International 2000, Harris <em>et al. </em>2012)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Various studies (Pearson 1968, Corkhill 1973, Bradstreet and Brown 1985, BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, based on different breeding colonies, have estimated the theoretical maximum foraging radius at anywhere from 32 km (Corkhill 1973)<strong><sup></sup></strong> to 200 km (Bradstreet and Brown 1985). <p></p>","<p>This species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as increased sea surface temperature (SST) and associated shifts in prey (e.g. Herring, Sandeel) distribution, abundance and quality (Durant<em> et al.</em> 2003, Sandvik<em> et al. </em>2005). Breeding failures are usually assumed to be due to food shortages (e.g. Martin 1989, Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006, Harris and Wanless 2011, Anker-Nilssen <em>et al.</em> 2016), as changing temperatures can cause mismatches between plankton blooms, prey abundance peaks and Puffin breeding seasons, leading to poor chick growth, shortened nesting periods and lower fledging success (Durant <em>et al. </em>2006). Sandvik <em>et al.</em> (2005) demonstrated decreased survival in North Atlantic seabirds (including the puffin) with increasing SST. There are several recorded examples of food stock collapse and its detrimental consequences for Puffins; The Sandeel population collapse near Shetland in 1985-1990 led to successive years of breeding failures (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2004), and another Sandeel crash in South and West Iceland and the Faroes in 2003-2005 led to food scarcity and collapse of Puffin populations with some colonies having 0% breeding success (Hansen and Sigurdsson <em>in litt. </em>2016).</p>  <p>Extreme weather and storms can cause mass mortality of seabirds, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter storms at sea, and represents a potentially growing threat due to the predicted increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (Melillo <em>et al. </em>2014). In Pop Witless Bay, extreme cold and wet weather in 2011 caused the death of thousands of chicks across Witless Bay Reserve (Wilhelm <em>et al.</em> 2015). A severe wreck in March 2016 also delayed breeding on Isle of May (Newell 2016). The 2002 Norway wreck could have caused the death of as many as 100,000 birds, diagnosed as prolonged exposure to adverse feeding conditions at sea (but may also have been caused by disease or climatic factors affecting prey abundance) (Anker-Nilssen<em> et al.</em> 2013). A large wreck occurred in March 2013 along the coast of Scotland/northeastern UK, also coinciding with periods of extreme weather (3,055 and 1,364 birds collected on Scottish and English coast, respectively), where the majority died of starvation, likely due to difficulty feeding at sea (Harris and Elkins 2013). Productivity fell to 0.46 in the Farne islands in 2015 due to flooding caused by two major storms that destroyed nests with chicks (Wildlife review 2015). More such examples have been recorded throughout the species’ range.</p>  <p>The threat of climate change to food stocks is exacerbated by the unsustainable harvesting of prey species by commercial fisheries, causing further reductions in food availability and subsequent low breeding success (Breton and Diamond 2014). Major fisheries have been noted as contributing to the collapse of key prey fish species since the 1960s and been linked to reproductive failure at colonies such as Røst, Norway (reduced recruitment due to food shortage in breeding season is considered the most likely cause of decline during 1986-2012) (Tasker <em>et al. </em>2000, Anker-Nilssen <em>et al.</em> 2003, Miles <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition to overharvesting of prey stocks, commercial fisheries are a cause of direct mortality. The Atlantic Puffin’s foraging strategy (diving) makes the species susceptible to being caught in gillnets and other fishing gear, but bycatch has not been recorded in significantly large numbers (Tasker <em>et al.</em> 2000, Rogan and Mackey 2007) and likely has a “trivial effect” on Puffin populations (Harris and Wanless 2011).</p>  <p>At the breeding colonies, the species is vulnerable to invasive predators. American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em> is known to take puffins from burrows, and the escape of mink from fur farms in Iceland in the early 1930s drove many colonies to extinction in the following decades (Harris and Wanless 2011). Mink are still causing low rates of chick survival in parts of the range, including Hornøya, Norway (Barrett 2015). Rats <em>Rattus</em> spp. depredate eggs and chicks and have been linked to drastic colony declines and local extinctions in Sweden (Harris and Wanless 2011), on the Faroe Islands (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007), Lundy Island (Lock 2006), Shiant Islands (Lockley 1953), and Ailsa Craig and Puffin Islands (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2004) (see also TemaNord 2010). Recolonisation and population recovery can be seen after rat eradication (Lock 2006).</p>  <p>Hunting of puffins, mostly for human consumption, is allowed on the Faeroe Islands and Iceland (Thorup <em>et al. </em>2014), yet uncontrolled harvesting in nesting grounds may lead to local declines. Adult birds are taken during the nesting season, thus causing reduced reproductive success and significant adult mortality, in addition to the general effects of disturbance. 10,000 individuals were recorded to be taken annually in the Nólsoy colony (Faeroes) and 150,000 in Iceland. This is suspected to limit recovery of populations and may exceed recruitment rate on Iceland, while the Nólsoy population is considered stable only due to migration (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007). The species is particularly vulnerable to disturbance when nesting, and human intrusion associated with other recreational activities (tourism, walks) may also impact the species. Nest desertions have been recorded (Nettleship <em>et al. </em>2014), and at one study site a 40% decrease in breeding success was seen in a frequently visited area compared to the control site (Rodway<em> et al. </em>1996).</p>  <p>The species is also vulnerable to oil spills and other forms of marine pollution. Past oil spills have had severe impacts on affected puffin populations; the wreck of the Torrey Canyon in 1967 was linked to decline in puffin numbers at Sept-Iles (Brittany) and the wreck of the oil tanker Amoco Cadiz (1978) badly affected moulting puffins in the region, killing 1,391 confirmed puffins which coincided with a 44% reduction in the Sept-Iles population. The number of Puffins killed is likely an underestimate, as many will not be recovered or identified on beaches after wrecks (Harris and Wanless 2011). Oiled puffins are often unable to fly, accentuating the effects of reduced food supplies and extreme weather preventing feeding. However, other oil spills seem to have had less effect on Puffin populations; the Tricolor spill in 2003 (Netherlands) was not found to have been a major cause of a local puffin wreck (35% of birds were oiled, most after death) (Camphuysen 2003). Nonetheless, the greatest impact of oil spills is likely to be on long-term condition of adults and ecosystem degradation, imposing a further risk to the Atlantic Puffin’s food resources. Various incidences of other marine pollutants have been recorded in the species; in 1970 21% of carcasses found in Scotland, and 22% of those shot off the coast of Norway contained elastic threads and other plastic particles (nylon thread, plastic beads etc). Given that the same proportion of pollutants were measured in healthy and deceased Puffins on Isle of May, pollution is regarded unlikely to be the primary cause of death, but may still pose a risk by accumulating over time and accentuating other threats for individuals already compromised by low food availability, adverse climatic conditions or hunting. The highest proportion of pollutants were found in first year birds, which may be explained by higher mortality among young birds with higher loads and only the less polluted birds reaching adulthood (Harris and Wanless 2011).  </p><p>Increasing numbers of offshore windfarms could result in displacement, but the risk of collision is considered very low (Bradbury <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, a study into puffin vision suggests they may be vulnerable to collision with man-made objects related to underwater wind farms (Martin and Wanless 2015).<br/></p>","The European population is estimated to be 4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, which equates to 9,550,000-11,600,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The global population size is estimated at&#160;12–14 million mature individuals (Harris and Wanless 2011; Berglund and Hentati-Sundberg 2014).",Decreasing,"The Atlantic Puffin can be found throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, from north-west Greenland (<strong>to </strong><strong>Denmark</strong>) to the coastline of Newfoundland (<strong>Canada</strong>) and Maine (<strong>USA</strong>) in the west, and from north-west <strong>Russia&#160;</strong>down to the Canary Islands, <strong>Spain</strong> (in winter) in the east (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. The population in <strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>, which together account for 80% of the European population, decreased markedly since the early 2000s (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;In much of Iceland breeding has generally failed every year since 2003, but in the north, at least, it has been borderline sustainable (G. A. Gudmundsson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015, E. Hansen <em>in litt. </em>2016, A. Petersen <em>in litt. </em>2016). The largest Norwegian colony, Røst, has experienced sharp declines&#160;from almost 1.5 million breeding pairs in 1979 to only 289,000 pairs in 2015, and has produced virtually no chicks in the last 9 years&#160;(T. Anker-Nilssen <em>in litt</em>. 2015, Anker-Nilssen <em>et al. </em>2016). Most other Norwegian colonies are much smaller, including that at Runde, which has also declined; however most colonies remain unmonitored (A. O. Folkestad&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015, T. Anker-Nilssen <em>in litt</em>. 2015, 2016). Numbers on the southern coast of the Barents Sea have increased such that declines in the total population in Norway are estimated at approximately 33% since the early 1980s (Fauchald <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Populations in the Faroe Islands (Denmark) and Greenland are also reported to be decreasing (BirdLife International 2015).<br/>The population size was estimated to be increasing in the U.K. during 1969-2000, and populations in the North Sea are probably currently stable or increasing after a decline in the 2000s due to two very low overwinter survivals of adults (Harris and Wanless 2011,&#160;<a>Harris <em>et al.</em> 2013</a>).&#160;A reduction in the recruitment of juveniles into the breeding population is thought to be the most likely factor involved in a sharp decrease in the number of puffins at the Fair Isle (U.K.) breeding colony; from approximately 20,200 individuals in 1986 to 10,700 individuals in 2012 (Miles&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Adult survival probability remained similar across the 27 years of the study, whilst breeding success, the number of feeding visits by adults to chicks and the size of available prey fish all decreased. Trends from North America are uncertain, with the population at Great Island, Witless Bay showing increases between 1979 and 1994, but it has potentially stabilised or is in decline now (Wilhelm <em>et al. </em>2015).

It also attends trawlers and will form large congregations where food is plentiful. Breeding is highly seasonal starting between March and April, usually in large colonies on cliffs and offshore islands, but also sometimes on the mainland. Young birds will migrate to the extreme south of its range, whereas adults range less extensively but still regularly winter in the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","Northern Gannets are consistently recorded as bycatch across fisheries in the Atlantic. It is the species most freqently killed as bycatch in fisheries assessed in Portuguese Atlantic waters, and captured at a relatively high rate in demersal longline operations, but also set-nets and purse-seines (Oliveira&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Total estimates of numbers killed are lacking. In nearshore water off the east coast of the U.S., estimates of under 500 individuals per year suggest that population level impacts may be relatively small; however, this is derived from observers on less than 5% of fisheries within a small proportion of the range, and there is no cumulative assessment of impact (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). Considering the observation of bycatch in fisheries across the range of the Northern Gannet (Smith and Morgan 2005, García-Barcelona&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010, Oliviera <em>et al. </em>2015) and evidence of increased breeding populations following the closure of Canadian gillnet fisheries (Regular <em>et al. </em>2013),&#160;levels of bycatch are sufficient to cause significant declines in the species.

Its diet is comprised mainly of flying-fish and squid, but also some halfbeak (<em>Hemiramphu</em>), mullet (<em>Mugil</em>) and anchovy (<em>Engraulis</em>). Prey is usually caught by plunge-diving and it can also snatch prey off the surface of water. Kleptoparasitism has been observed, mostly by females. Breeding is seasonal in some areas, but elsewhere it breeds opportunistically or more or less continuously. Nests are built on the ground in the midst of vegetation on rocky islands or coral atolls. Individuals form colonies that are usually smaller than those of other <em>Sula </em>species (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1992).","Brown Boobies are hunted for use as food and bait in some areas of their range (Carboneras <em>et al. </em>2018); however, this is thought to have negligible effects on their population. They are also highly sensitive to human disturbance, with the presence of humans 10-20 m from the nest enough to cause the birds to leave (Borsa <em>et al. </em>2010). Humans also indirectly affect the species; Verlis<em> et al. </em>(2014) found that most <em>S. leucogaster</em> nests surveyed contain at least one item of marine debris, with black and green items positively selected for as a nesting material. Further to this, Lavers <em>et al.</em> (2013) found that around 30% of the debris poses some entanglement risk to the birds. This is currently unlikely to represent a significant source of injury and mortality (Lavers <em>et al.</em> 2013), but is likely to increase due to the long term persistence of marine debris. In the past, organochemical pollution has caused a significant reduction  in reproductive success due to the thinning of eggshells, often caused by DDT use in agricultural areas as well as, in one case, mosquito control  for a tourist development. Currently, eggshell thickness varies in  relation to individual characteristics and/or feeding sources, as  opposed to actual exposure and, where records are available, eggshell  thickness has recovered to pre-DDT conditions (Mellink <em>et al.</em> 2009).

Most of its food is obtained by surface seizing but it will also plunge (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Tracking at Bear Island (Norway) revealed breeders foraging close to the colony, preferring the continental shelf. As chicks became older, parents foraged further from the colony, eventually regularly embarking on long trips to the Norwegian coast (Weimerskirch <em>et al</em>. 2001).","<p>In some breeding colonies, the species is susceptible to low level predation from invasive mammals such as rats <em>Rattus </em>spp., cats <em>Felis catus</em> and Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> (Mendel <em>et al.</em> 2008).

The majority of these contained more than the 0.1g per individual deemed acceptable under the OSPAR agreement; however, there is evidence that relatively large loads of ingested plastic may be processed through a bird relatively rapidly (van Franeker <em>et al.</em> 2011). Plastic loads are higher in juvenile birds and there is some evidence that adults pass on plastic to chicks. The effect of plastic ingestion on the population is unknown.</p>  The species was subject to intensive exploitation for food in the past, and hunting continues in Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard and the Faroe Islands (Thorup <em>et al</em>. 2014, Carboneras <em>et al.</em> 2016).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","This marine species can nearly always be found over pelagic waters except when at colonies. It feeds mostly on fish, with some cephaolopods, crustaceans and insects. It catches prey mainly on the wing by dipping but also by surface-seizing or pursuit-plunging. It will congregate with other seabirds and dolphins when around schooling fish, and will often attend trawlers and smaller fishing boats. Its breeding season is very variable nesting in burrows in colonies on offshore islands or atolls (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","<p>Competition with commercial fisheries likely poses the greatest threat to this species. Over-exploitation of tuna fisheries is greatly reducing prey availability (Brooke 2004) as the shearwaters rely on tuna to herd shoals of small fish to the surface where they become available for surface-feeding (Ratcliffe 1999). Human disturbance by visitors to islands where the species breeds have been found to negatively affect breeding success (Benoit and Bretagnolle 2002). Brown Rats <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> were previously present on many of the offshore islands where this species bred, and in some cases caused local extinction of populations. Following the eradication of rats from several islands, the species has reclaimed past territories, and is again successfully breeding in these areas (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2006). The presence of feral cats <em>Felis</em> <em>catus</em> is encouraged through feeding by humans, and are causing a much lower fledging rate for chicks on Malaekahana (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2002). Small amounts of plastic have been found in Wedge-tailed Shearwater chicks (in majority smaller than 1cm<sup>2</sup>), but none in adults as of yet. If plastic pollution in the foraging areas increases, this could potentially impact fledging success and eventually adult mortality (Verlis <em>et al</em>. 2013). Increased sea surface temperature has been demonstrated to reduce the provisioning rate, and above a particular temperature threshold reproductive success is nil (Chambers <em>et al</em>. 2011).

Hence it is listed as Vulnerable. If invasive species, harvesting of chicks, bycatch in fisheries or other factors are found to be causing population declines, the species might warrant uplisting to Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","<p>Birds arrive at the colonies in early October-November. Eggs are laid in December, with fledging and dispersal in late April-late May (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>). On Robinson Crusoe, nesting has been recorded in burrows scattered throughout badly eroded, generally sparsely vegetated but occasionally forested habitat at elevations of 50-390 m. On Santa Clara, the species breeds in scattered colonies in eroded terrain at elevations from 15-300m (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). On Isla Mocha, the colony is in forest (predominant tree <em>Aextoxicon punctatum</em>), with the highest burrow densities along mountain ridges and between the roots of old-growth trees up to 390 m (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999). It feeds primarily in offshore waters over the continental shelf but also in pelagic waters (Hodum<em> et al.</em> 2004), mostly on fish (sardines <em>Strangomera bentincki</em> and anchovies <em>Engraulis ringens</em> [<span lang=""EN-CA"">Guicking <em>et al</em>. 2001]), squid and to a lesser extent, crustaceans (D. Guicking and P. H. Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Birds breeding on Santa Clara demonstrate a diet dominated by fish, with squid comprising a smaller proportion of the diet (CEC 2005).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Interactions with fisheries potentially poses a major threat to this species (Guicking <em>et al</em>. 2001, CEC 2005, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2012). Birds have been found entangled in fishing gear near colonies and in the non-breeding range (Guicking<em> et al. </em> 1999, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2012). The distribution of longline commercial fishing activities overlap both spatially and temporally with the species’ wintering range over the continental shelf of North America, making the risk of interacting with the fishing fleet highly likely (CEC 2005). Bycatch mortality has been recorded in artisanal fisheries off the coast of Ecuador and Peru (Mangel 2012) which are poorly regulated and consist of a considerable number of small longline vessels whose overall impact may exceed that of large-scale fisheries. In Chile, capture by small vessels represents at least 76% of the overall bycatch of this species (Suazo <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016).</p>  <p>Predation by cats <em>Felis catus</em> and Coatimundis <em>Nasua nasua</em> on Robinson Crusoe, and cats and dogs <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em> on Mocha (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999) represents another significant threat. The population of coatimundi appears to have declined from historical levels on Robinson Crusoe but predation is still being documented (P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2017). On Isla Mocha, burrows excavated by dogs have been found, but there is no evidence of significant predation occurring (P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2017). European Rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> compete with shearwaters for burrows on Robinson Crusoe but were eradicated from Santa Clara in 2003 with a resultant 40% increase in the proportion of burrows occupied by breeding pairs (Hodum <em>et al</em>. 2017). Soil erosion by goats <em>Capra aegagrus hireus</em> and rabbits affects populations on Robinson Crusoe (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, J. C. Torres-Mura <em>in litt</em>. 1999). At present, due to the highly restricted distribution of goats on the island, their impacts are minimal, in contrast to the pervasive presence of rabbits in all breeding colonies on Robinson Crusoe (P. Hodum <em>pers. comm</em>.). Cattle <em>Bos taurus</em> in one colony on Robinson Crusoe cause soil erosion and burrow collapses, but the core area of the colony is protected by a cattle-proof fence (Gladics and Hodum 2010); yet, cattle still impact burrows outside this area, although to a lesser extent (P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Both House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> and Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em> occur on Isla Mocha and Robinson Crusoe, but their impacts are unknown (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). Stable isotope analyses of rat tissue suggest they are feeding at lower, terrestrial trophic levels, and no evidence has been found of eggs or chicks consumed by rats in burrows (P. Hodum <em>in litt.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Chicks are harvested by islanders on Mocha in the fledgling season (March-May), with an estimated 20% of all chicks (3000-5000) taken in 1998 (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, CEC 2005). More recently, due to enforcement of the prohibition of chick harvest begun in 2011, the magnitude of the chick harvest has decreased considerably, but illegal poaching still seems to occur most years (ACAP 2018). Quantitative estimates of harvest rates are difficult to obtain (P. Hodum <em>pers. comm</em>.). In 2018, illegal hunting was reported from Isla Mocha with c. 300 individuals killed in one incident (ACAP 2018).</p>  Plastic ingestion is widespread in the species, but there is no indication of what impact this currently has, or will have over the next three generations at either the individual or population level (P.

Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999]) off the coast of Arauco, <strong>Chile</strong>. Recent evidence suggests a small colony on Isla Santa Maria in the Gulf of Arauco, Chile (P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>). These sites combined indicate around 30,000 breeding pairs, which would imply a maximum of 100,000 individuals (Brooke 2004). Following breeding, the species disperses northward along the west coast of South America towards North America (CEC 2005). There are also isolated records during the non-breeding period in Chilean Patagonia (Imberti 2005, C.G. Suazo <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The migration is evident by its increasing presence along the continental shelf from the Gulf of California in Mexico to British Columbia in Canada, during April and May each year. Numbers peak between August and October, followed by a rapid decline in November, as birds return to their breeding colonies (CEC 2005). Based on ship-based observations, and satellite tracking, <em>Ardenna creatopus</em> ranges from the northern Gulf of Alaska (from approximately 59.87º N) to southern Chile (to roughly 50.00º S); primarily over the continental shelf and slope regions (Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2012 <em>in </em>ACAP 2013). A specimen has also been taken from the Atlantic coast of Argentina (Mazar Barnett and Navas 1998) and there are records from New Zealand and Australia (Patterson 1991, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Despite probable declines in the past, populations in the Juan Fernández group appear to have been more or less stable over the past 15 years (CEC 2005, P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>), although the breeding population on Santa Clara Island increased by 40% following the eradication of European rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) from the island in 2003 (P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>). In contrast, populations on Isla Mocha may be declining owing to the effects of chick harvesting (CEC 2005), although breeding season monitoring between 2010-2016 suggested a stable population during that time (P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>).&#160;Birds have been entangled in fishing gear near colonies and in the non-breeding range (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, D. Guicking and P. H.

Harvesting of chicks is illegal under Chilean law (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999),<strong> </strong>although this was unenforced until 2011. Since 2011, the park guards have worked with the federal police to enforce the prohibition on chick harvesting. In Canada, <em>Ardenna creatopus</em> was assessed as Threatened in 2004 (COSEWIC 2013). In 2005, the CEC published the North American Conservation Action Plan for the species (CEC 2005).

Short trips allow greater chick provisioning at the sacrifice of body condition, which is then recovered in richer sub-Antarctic waters. Diet includes fish (particularly mycotphids), crustaceans and squid (Weimerskirch and Cherel 1998). Feeding occurs in flocks of up to 20,000 birds, and it has been seen in association with cetaceans. &#160;It is a trans-equatorial migrant, wintering off Aleutian Islands, some moving north of Bering Strait (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992).","<p>The species suffered substantial mortality from entanglement in gill nets set for salmon in the Northern Pacific, particularly off Japan with c. 40,000 birds captured per annum (DeGange and Day 1991, Uhlmann 2003).

A number much higher than anticipated, of (predominantly juvenile) shearwaters were found dead or injured as a result of being attracted to lights and grounded. Over a 15-year period of patrols on Phillip Island, Australia (1999-2013), 8,871 fledglings were found grounded, 39% of which were dead or dying. The incidence levels far exceed those of other Shearwater spp. (up to 8x), however less than 1% of fledglings produced annually are thought to be affected by mortality from attraction to artificial light (Rodriguez <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>  Wreck (mass-mortality events) have been reported, e.g. at Bering Sea 1997 (Hyrenbach <em>et al</em>. 2001) and in Australia 2013 (Peter and Dooley 2014) and are potentially linked to ecosystem changes caused by climate change (Brooke 2004). Recent studies indicate that both young and adults suffer from the ingestion of marine plastic debris, with potentially lethal effects (Carey 2011). Competition for food by Pink Salmon <em>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</em> may also be contributing to declines (Toge <em>et al.</em> 2011).","Brooke (2004)   estimated the global population to number &gt; 23 million individuals,   while national population estimates include: &lt;1,000 individuals on   migration in Taiwan; &gt;1,000 individuals on migration in Japan and   &gt;1,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"This species breeds on Tasmania and off the coast of south <strong>Australia</strong>, with the bulk of the population in the south-east.

At South Georgia, this species is undergoing a rapid decline over three generations (70 years). On the Crozet and Kerguelen Islands, the populations rapidly declined between 1970-1986, then stabilised, but have recently declined again. Longline fishing is likely to be the main cause of decline in this species, causing reductions in adult survival and juvenile recruitment, and this threat is on-going. <p></p>","<p><strong>Behaviour</strong> <em>Diomedea exulans </em>is a biennial breeding species, although about 30% of successful and 35% of failed breeders (on average) defer breeding beyond the expected year. Adults return to colonies in November, and eggs are laid over a period of 5 weeks during December and January. Most chicks hatch in March and fledge in December. Birds usually return to colonies when 5-7 years old, though they can return when as young as 3 years old. Birds can start breeding as young as 7 or 8 years old, but more typically at 10-12 years old (Tickell 2000). Wandering Albatross typically forages in oceanic waters, however considerable time is spent over shelf areas during certain stages of the breeding season (BirdLife International 2004). Satellite tracking has revealed that juvenile birds tend to forage further north than adults (Weimerskirch <em>et al. </em>2006, British Antarctic Survey, <em>unpubl. data</em>), bringing them into greater overlap with longline tuna fleets which may be driving falls in recruitment rates (Weimerskirch <em>et al.</em> 1997). Females may also be at greater risk of being caught in tuna fisheries since they tend to forage further north than males (Nel <em>et al.</em> 2002, Weimerskirch <em>et al.</em> 2003, Pinaud and Weimerskirch 2007, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is mostly a diurnal breeder, taking most prey by surface-seizing (ACAP 2009). <br/></p><p><strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding </em>Wandering Albatross nests in open or patchy vegetation near exposed ridges or hillocks (Carboneras 1992). <br/></p><p><strong>Diet</strong> Adults feed at sea mainly on cephalopods and fish, often following ships and feeding on offal and galley refuse (Carboneras 1992, Cherel and Klages 1998). Patagonian Toothfish <em>Dissostichus eleginoides </em>is the primary fish species in the diet, potentially obtained as discarded offal (Xavier <em>et al</em>. 2004). <strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>Foraging range </strong>This wide-ranging species has a circumpolar distribution, and both breeding and non-breeding birds have very large foraging ranges. Satellite tracking data indicate that breeding birds forage at very long distances from colonies (up to 4,000 km) and that foraging strategies change throughout the breeding season (Froy <em>et al.</em> 2015). A fledgling covered 6,590 km in 28 days after leaving the colony on Marion Island (Clokie 2007).</p><p></p>","<p>The observed decline of this species has been shown to be driven largely by incidental catch in fisheries, which has reduced adult survival and juvenile recruitment (Rolland <em>et a</em>l. 2010, Pardo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Fisheries were responsible for a 54% decrease in numbers on the Crozet Islands between 1970 and 1986 (Weimerskirch <em>et al</em>. 1997). The South Georgia population is declining rapidly, but other populations (Prince Edward Islands and Crozet Islands) have shown signs of recovery. The South Georgia population disperses throughout the Southern Ocean during the nonbreeding season, although may be most at risk from longline fisheries operating in the south-west Atlantic throughout the year (Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016, Tancell <em>et al</em>. 2016), whereas the Crozet and Prince Edward Island populations are most vulnerable to pelagic longline fishing in the Indian Ocean and Australian region (Weimerskirch 1998, Nel <em>et al.</em> 2002c). The apparent recovery of populations from the Crozet and Prince Edward Islands during the early 1990s was ascribed to reduced fishing effort and relocation of fisheries away from foraging grounds, however increased effort in the late 1990s at various different localities may once again be impacting these populations (Weimerskirch <em>et al</em>. 1997, Nel <em>et al</em>. 2002b), as even low bycatch rates will affect the species due to the small population size (ACAP 2009). The Macquarie population was harvested extensively by sealers and despite recoveries in the early 20th century, it experienced subsequent declines that were also attributed to longline fisheries (de la Mare and Kerry 1994). Additionally, chicks are vulnerable to the accumulation of anthropogenic debris and fishing hooks, which may kill a small number annually (Nel and Nel 1999, Phillips <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2016).  </p><p>The impacts of predation by introduced species are severe for some breeding populations. On Kerguelen, in some years, certain colonies have suffered complete breeding failure due to chick predation by cats <em>Felis catus</em> (H. Weimerskirch <em>in litt</em>. 2008). House mice <em>Mus musculus</em> have been recorded attacking Wandering Albatross chicks on Marion Island since 2003 and continue to affect up to 1% of the population (Dilley <em>et al</em>. 2015). There has been extensive habitat loss and degradation at South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur) due to the activities of Antarctic Fur Seals <em>Arctocephalus gazelle</em> (ACAP 2009).</p>  Shifts in the oceanic habitat have been demonstrated to negatively impact the species, and are likely to be exacerbated with future climate change, and expected to cause significant declines over the next three generation period (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Several climatic variables have a significant correlation with mortality and breeding success, sometimes with different effects among different locations and on juvenile vs. adult survival (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2017).<p></p><p></p>","<p>In 1998, the total annual breeding population was estimated at 8,500 pairs, equivalent to c. 28,000 mature individuals (Gales 1998). However, current estimates are 1,553 pairs on South Georgia (Georgias del Sur) (Poncet <em>et al.</em> 2006), 1,800 pairs on Prince Edward Island (2008, Ryan <em>et al. </em>2009), c. 1,900 pairs on Marion Island (2013, ACAP 2009), c. 340 pairs on Iles Crozet (CNRS Chinzè Monitoring Database 2010), c. 354 pairs in Iles Kerguelen (CNRS Chinzè Monitoring Database 2011), and 4 pairs on Macquarie Island (DPIWPE 2010, unpublished data), making a total of c. 6,000 annual breeding pairs. Using the same ratio as Gales (1998) for estimating the number of mature individuals, this would equate to approximately 20,100 mature individuals.</p><p></p> <p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Diomedea exulans</em> breeds on South Georgia (Georgias del Sur) (c. 18% of the global breeding population), Prince Edward Islands (<strong>South Africa</strong>) (c. 44% of the global population), Crozet Islands and Kerguelen Islands (<strong>French Southern Territories</strong>) (approximately 38% of the global population) and Macquarie Island (<strong>Australia</strong>) (approximately four pairs breeding per year), with a total global population of c. 8,050 pairs breeding in any given year (ACAP 2009). At South Georgia, the population declined by 1.8% per annum between 1984 and 2004 (Poncet <em>et al.</em> 2006), and continued to decline by 1.8% per annum between 2004 and 2015 (A. Wolfaardt <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The population on Crozet declined by 54% between 1970 and 1986. From the mid-1980s to late 1990s, the Crozet, Kerguelen and Prince Edward Islands populations appeared to be stable or increasing (Weimerskirch <em>et al.</em> 1997, Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2003, Ryan <em>et al.</em> 2003), but declines were later detected (H. Weimerskirch <em>in litt. </em>2008, Ryan <em>et al.<em> </em></em>2009). Overall declines are estimated to exceed 30% over 70 years. Recovery is believed to be impeded by a decline in recruitment rate (Weimerskirch <em>et al. </em>2006). Non-breeding and juvenile birds remain north of 50°S between subantarctic and subtropical waters with a significant proportion crossing the Indian Ocean to wintering grounds around the southern and eastern coast of Australia (Weimerskirch <em>et al.</em> 2014). A significant proportion of the Crozet and Kerguelen populations disperse into the Pacific and the western coast of South America (Weimerskirch <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2015).&#160;</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix II and ACAP Annex 1.

The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has introduced measures which have reduced bycatch of albatrosses around South Georgia by over 99%. Recently, other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, including the tuna commissions, have taken initial steps to reduce seabird bycatch rates.

Given the difficulty of predicting long-term trends for such a long-lived species, and the number of documented threats and the uncertainty over their future effects, the species is precautionarily projected to undergo a moderately rapid population decline over three generations (84 years), and as such qualifies as Near Threatened (nearly qualifies for listing as threatened under criterion A4bd). <p></p>","<p>Laysan Albatross is an annual breeder though,<strong> </strong>like other albatross species, each year a proportion of birds will skip a breeding season. Nests vary from a simple scoop in the sand to more elaborate nests where vegetation allows. Wisdom, a&#160;<em>Phoebastria immutabilis</em>&#160;female estimated to be 65 years old is still breeding (<span lang=""EN-CA"">https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Midway_Atoll/wildlife_and_habitat/Wisdom_Profile.html).&#160;High rates of mate change (14%), super-normal clutches as a result of same-sex pairing (31% of pairs), observed on Oahu and Kauai, Hawaii are all previously unreported for the species (Young <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2009a Young and VanderWerf 2014). The high rates of same-sex pairing is thought to result from a slightly skewed sex ratio (57% female) (Young <em>et al</em>. 2008). Diet analysis indicates that it feeds primarily on cephalopods (Pittman <em>et al. </em>2004), though also on a variety of fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates (Tickell 2000). Satellite tracking has revealed the large journeys made even while breeding (Fernandez <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">et al</em>. 2001, Naughton <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">et al</em>. 2007, S. Shaffer<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;""> in litt.&#160;</em>2007). Breeding birds at Tern Island switch from a local unimodal foraging strategy during brooding, to a bimodal foraging strategy incorporating more distant, highly productive subarctic waters during the rearing period and responding to climatic variability readily (Hyrenbach <em>et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;""> </em>2002, Kappes <em>et al</em>. 2010, Thorne <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reproductive success has been linked to foraging location, with pairs fledging chicks two years in a row not foraging near continental shelves (Edwards and Parrish 2008). Recent data has demonstrated that reproductive success is linked to the distance of the breeding grounds from the transition zone (closer resulting in higher reproductive success) and prevailing wind conditions in any given year (Thorne <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016). It is thought that this ability may be influenced by information gathered during the non-breeding season (Edwards and Parrish 2008).</p><p></p>","<p>Populations were greatly reduced by feather and egg collecting in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and by high seas drift nets for squid and salmon that were active between 1978 and 1992. Prior to its closure, the high seas driftnet fishery killed over 17,500 Laysan Albatross in 1990 alone (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1993). Current key threats include incidental capture in pelagic (Crowder and Myers 2002) and demersal longline fisheries (Stehn <em>et al.</em> 2001) in the North Pacific as well as in illegal high seas driftnet operations. Analyses in 2001 estimated that pelagic longliners in the North Pacific may kill 5,000-18,000 <em>Phoebastria immutabilis</em> per year, with 8,000 thought the most likely figure, while demersal longline operations in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries were estimated to kill c.715 birds per year (Crowder and Myers 2001). It has been recently estimated that on average, 156 <em>Phoebastria immutabilis</em> are taken annually in the Alaskan federal groundfish and Pacific Halibut <em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em> fisheries, (in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of Alaska Fishery Management Plan areas), targeting Pacific Cod <em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>, Sablefish <em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>, and Halibut <em>Hippoglossus</em> spp.. Off Canada’s west coast, the estimated annual bycatch mortality of albatrosses (primarily Black-footed Albatross) averages 85 birds per year (range 25-128) (COSEWIC 2013, K. Morgan, <em>unpublished data</em>, 2016). The bycatch rates in Japanese and Taiwanese pelagic longline fisheries in the North Pacific are still largely unknown. </p>  <p>Climate change poses an ongoing threat in terms of storms and flooding, and a future threat in terms of habitat alteration from sea-level rise. A majority of the population nests on low-lying islands and atolls and it is predicted that with climate change and the resulting rise in sea-level, there will be significant inundation and loss nesting habitat (Storlazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013, Reynolds <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p>  <p>Other threats include pollution from oil spills, organochlorine, lead and plastic ingestion, as well as invasive species, human disturbance and conflicts with aircrafts (Harrison 1990, Ludwig <em>et al.</em> 1998, Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2003, Finkelstein 2006, Young <em>et al</em>. 2014). Chicks with large volumes of proventricular plastic have been reported to have fledging weights significantly lower than chicks with low amounts of plastic, and there is some evidence to suggest it may have affected survival rates in 1986, when the volume of plastic ingestion was at its highest (Sievert and Sileo 2008). Up to 10,000 chicks per year are potentially affected by lead poisoning from paint on buildings at Midway Atoll (Finkelstein 2006), and 7% of chicks on Sand Island fail to fledge from lead poisoning each year, with a predicted impact of 16% reduction in population size over the course of 50 years equating to 190,000 fewer birds (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  Avian pox virus affects chicks on Midway and the Main Hawaiian Islands where introduced mosquitoes are present, but the associated declines are negligible (VanderWerf and Young 2016). Invasive predators also pose a threat. Dogs <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em> kill adults and chicks on inhabited islands in Hawaii. Observations from Guadalupe Island, Mexico, in December 2002 recorded that, of the 490 adults on the island, 35 were killed by feral cats&#160;<em>Felis catus</em> (7% of the total island breeding population that year, and 30% of the Punta Sur colony) (Keitt <em>et al</em>. 2006). Cats were also responsible for a tripling in nest failure rate at this colony (49%) compared with the nearby cat free Negro Islet colony (13%) (Keitt <em>et al</em>. 2006). Cat control around the colony from Jan-Mar 2003 removed 18 cats and curtailed adult mortality from cat predation, although cats continued to be seen around the colony after the breeding season ended (Keitt <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is likely that the population here had not experienced high levels of predation prior to 2002, as otherwise it would have been extirpated. Other introduced predators (notably the Polynesian rat <em>Rattus exulans</em>; Jones <em>et al</em>. 2008) may pose a minor threat to colonies in Mexico and on the Main Hawaiian Islands. Rats have been recorded killing adults on rare occasions, but this mortality is minimal and hence not believed to be driving significant declines. House mice <em>Mus musculus</em> on Sand Island began attacking adult Laysan Albatross in 2015, with the behaviour spreading rapidly in the following breeding season. An eradication is planned and trapping around the colony has minimised chick losses. In 2002, observations on Clarion Island, Mexico, reported zero breeding success from the 46 nesting pairs, largely as a result of predation by several endemic species (e.g. Clarion Raven <em>Corvus corax</em> <em>clarionensis</em> and Clarion Racer <em>Masticophis anthonyi</em>; Wanless <em>et al.</em> 2009).<p></p>","The population is estimated to be more than c. 800,000 breeding pairs, equivalent to  c.1,600,000 mature individuals (Arata <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Midway Atoll, Laysan Island and French Frigate Shoals&#160;support 90% of the global breeding population.",Stable,"<p><em>Phoebastria immutabilis</em> breeds at 16 sites (nine with populations of greater than 100 pairs), mostly in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A</strong>.) and <strong>U.S. Minor Outlying Islands</strong>, with additional small colonies in <strong>Japan</strong> and <strong>Mexico</strong>. The population is estimated to be more than c. 800,000 breeding pairs, with the largest colony at Midway Atoll (666,044 pairs, https://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/Region_1/NWRS/Zone_1/Midway_Atoll/Documents/Hatch%20Year%202015%20NR_FINAL(4).pdf), followed by Laysan Island, both in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Arata <em>et al.</em> 2009). Population sizes at monitored colonies increased between 1980 and 1995 but have never reached the densities observed prior to large-scale harvests for feathers in the early 1900s. Data indicated a 32% decline during 1992-2002 (3.2% per annum) of birds breeding on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where 99% of the global population is found (Gilman and Freifeld 2003, USFWS data <em>per B.&#160;</em>Flint 2003 <em>pers comm.</em>), though data from 2004 and 2006 indicate that the breeding population then rebounded, and that the overall population trend for 1992-2005 is stable (Naughton <em>et al</em>. 2007). On Oahu, Hawaii the small population has increased 27% annually since 1991, and numbered 555 adults in 2015, due primarily to immigration with some local recruitment (Young <em>et al.</em> 2009a, VanderWerf and Young 2016). The island of Kauai contain&#160;~1,000 birds scattered amongst more than a dozen sites with an increasing trend comparable to Oahu (Young <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;A population began nesting in Mexico in the 1980s and has been increasing since then. The current population is about 400 pairs at four sites (46 pairs on Clarion Island in 2002; Wanless <em>et al.</em> 2009), though this represents less than 0.1% of the global population (Arata&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Breeding populations were extirpated from Wake and Johnston atolls (U.S.A.) and Minami Torishima (Japan) in the central Pacific. Ship-based observations, satellite tracking and fisheries bycatch reveal the wide distribution of <em>Phoebastria immutabilis</em> in the North Pacific, ranging from the northern Bering Sea to tropical waters in the South (10-15 degrees North) (Fisher and Fisher 1972, Fernandez <em>et al</em>. 2001, Hyrenbach <em>et al. </em>2002, Shaffer <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160;</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/> All of the major Hawaiian breeding localities are part of the US National Wildlife Refuge system or State of Hawaii Seabird Sanctuaries and, in 2006, the Papahânaumokuâkea Marine National Monument was established, encompassing all of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

Three breeding sites, supporting over 90% of the breeding population, are either counted directly or sampled at regular intervals. In 1991, a 50 Nautical Mile Protected Species Zone was established around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (primarily to protect monk seals). No longline fishing is allowed in this zone. In 2001 and 2007, respectively, USA and Canada released National Plans of Action to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in longline fisheries (NMFS 2001, DFO 2007). In 2002, the use of tori (streamer) lines became a mandatory condition of licence in commercial halibut, sablefish, and rockfish <em>Sebastes</em> spp. longline fisheries on Canada’s west coast (DFO 2007). Awareness programmes and mitigation trials have been started in several major longline fleets operating within the foraging range of this species; for example, the Hawaiian longline fishing fleet is required to use measures to reduce bycatch of seabirds. In 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission adopted a measure to require large longline vessels to use at least two seabird bycatch mitigation measures when fishing north of 23 degrees North.

They occur at highest densities in tropical areas, but even there are generally among the less common delphinids. The sum of existing abundance estimates is 59,157 animals, although the two largest estimates (accounting for approximately 94% of the total number) are more than 25 years old. No abundance estimates are available for a substantial part of the range of the species, and therefore total abundance is likely much higher than 60,000. Because of these whales’ low density, abundance estimates are imprecise, and thus there is no ability to assess trends in most areas.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales feed on fish species that are targeted by major high-value fisheries, including tunas and billfishes, and they regularly engage in depredation on both catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. This makes them both more vulnerable to bycatch in hook-and-line fisheries and to reductions in available prey than most species of cetaceans with similar distributions, as these other species tend to feed on small mesopelagic fish and squid or on deep-water prey such as squid.<br/><br/>The primary threats to False Killer Whales are incidental mortality (“bycatch”) in fisheries and, in some areas, directed hunting or culling. Generation length has been estimated at 25 years. Because of their life history, even low levels of bycatch or directed takes could result in population declines. Numbers taken in directed hunts in Japan have likely been great enough to reduce nearshore populations, and False Killer Whales are at least occasionally targeted in direct hunts in a few other parts of their range (Indonesia and West Indies). Bycatch is greatest in longline and other hook-and-line fisheries, but some mortality also occurs in gillnet and seine fisheries. In Hawaii, one area where they have been studied extensively, there is strong evidence of multiple subpopulations, and these have been recognized under U.S. law as separate stocks. Bycatch of the Hawaii pelagic stock in the U.S. longline fishery has been at a level thought to be high enough to limit population growth for most years since bycatch rates and abundance estimates have been available. This is a transboundary stock and foreign fleets account for the majority of longline effort in surrounding international waters, thus total bycatch levels are likely much higher than indicated by the U.S. observer program. Bycatch is known to occur in other areas but limited or no observer coverage in most fisheries and lack of abundance estimates precludes quantitative assessment of bycatch levels in relation to abundance. The only stock that has been quantitatively assessed (the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock) was estimated to have had a &gt;50% decline in abundance in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), with fishery interactions (primarily hooking and entanglement) thought to be the most important threat.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales were listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List in 2008, and the species remains data-poor for most of its range. The Red List Guidelines (Version 13, 2017) note that a taxon that comes close to qualifying for the Vulnerable (VU) category based on the Vulnerable thresholds qualifies for the Near Threatened (NT) category. This consideration combined with biological susceptibility and threat strengthens the case for a NT listing. A 30% or greater decline in three generations based on category A2(d) – a population reduction observed, estimated, inferred, or suspected, based on actual or potential levels of exploitation – qualifies a taxon for the Vulnerable category. The False Killer Whale comes close to meeting the criteria for VU for the following reasons: 1) there has been an estimated population decline of &gt;50% in two generations in the one population that has been quantitatively assessed, with the primary cause thought to be fishery interactions; 2) bycatch is a widespread threat at levels suspected to be large enough to result in population reduction throughout much of the taxon’s range, and levels of fishing effort are unlikely to decline substantially in the near future; 3) levels of directed take in some areas are likely high enough to have reduced local populations; and 4) biological susceptibility to population-level effects of bycatch exists given the life history of these whales, the overlap of their diet with the target species of high-value commercial fisheries, and their tendency to engage in depredation on catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. Given the above, False Killer Whales are therefore assessed as NT. Although the rangewide decline could be large enough for the species to qualify for VU, collecting the data necessary to quantify the extent of decline for a globally distributed, pelagic species is very difficult. Risk levels could be better assessed at the subpopulation level and efforts should be made toward that end.</p>","<p>While False Killer Whales occur in tropical, sub-tropical, and at least occasionally in warm temperate waters worldwide (Stacey <em>et al</em>. 1994, Odell and McClune 1999), their density is highest in the tropics (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). They are generally found in relatively deep, offshore waters, but individuals do approach close to shore around oceanic islands (e.g., Hawaii). Individuals from the main Hawaiian Islands resident subpopulation use both shallow (&lt;100 m) and deep (to 4,700 m) waters around the Hawaiian archipelago (Baird 2016). Some animals may move into shallow and higher latitude waters seasonally (e.g., off New Zealand; Zaeschmar 2014) or periodically (including some semi-enclosed seas such as the Red Sea and the Mediterranean). Individuals have been documented spending extended periods of time (two to three months) in shallow water areas of the Timor and Arafura seas (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2017). Individuals and groups have been reported to enter rivers on the Chinese mainland (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995), but it was not clear whether these occurrences might have represented pre-stranding behaviour.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales eat primarily relatively large fish and cephalopods (Alonso <em>et al</em>. 1999). They have been known to attack and consume small dolphins that have been injured or disoriented when released from tuna purse seine nets, but this behavior may be more akin to learning to take advantage of opportunistic food sources than to a predilection to feed on other species of marine mammals (Baird 2018). They eat some large species of fish, such as Mahimahi (also called Dorado or Dolphinfish), Yellowfin Tuna, Skipjack Tuna, Albacore Tuna, Opah, Wahoo, pomphrets, Broadbill Swordfish and Sailfish (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Hawaiian waters observational studies suggest that large pelagic game fish (Mahimahi, tunas, billfishes) form the majority of their diet (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016). Depredation data on longline-caught fish suggest a preference for billfishes, Wahoo and tunas over Mahimahi, pomfrets, Walu, sharks or lancetfishes (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>False Killer Whales are long-lived, slow to reproduce, upper-trophic level predators, and as such are subject to effects of a number of different anthropogenic stressors. The overlap of their diet with species targeted by fisheries, in particular high-value species such as tunas and billfishes, results in a number of types of interactions that can reduce local populations, although the sparseness of observer coverage in most hook-and-line and other fisheries within the range of False Killer Whales limits the information available. In addition, the False Killer Whale is one of several species known to mass strand (Caldwell <em>et al. </em>1970, Alonso <em>et al.</em> 1999, Liebig <em>et al.</em> 2007), with the largest known mass stranding of 835 individuals in Argentina in 1946 (Caillet-Bois 1948). Such mass strandings have the potential to affect local populations.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales are hooked in longline fisheries as they engage in depredation on both the catch and bait (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008, Thode <em>et al</em>. 2016). The U.S. Hawaii-based deep-set longline fishery has had approximately 20% observer coverage since 2001, and has provided detailed information on bycatch rates. In this fishery, False Killer Whales are the most frequently recorded species of cetacean hooked as bycatch (Forney and Kobayashi 2005, Bradford and Forney 2014). The first abundance estimates became available for the Hawaii pelagic stock in 2003 (Barlow 2006, Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b), and documented mortality and serious injury inside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago exceeded the potential biological removal (PBR) level for 10 of the 12 years from 2003-2015 (Carretta <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013,&#160;2017). Rates of hooking or entanglement are approximately 1.5 individuals for every 1 million hooks set. This is a transboundary population and non-U.S. fisheries outside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago represent the majority of longline effort, thus bycatch rates for the entire Hawaii pelagic stock are likely much higher than estimated. Non-lethal but potentially significant injuries (such as those that compromise health and ability to reproduce) may also occur if animals are hooked (Baird and Gorgone 2005, Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014, Alves <em>et al</em>. 2018). The rate of non-lethal line-related injuries is significantly higher in the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock than in the Hawaii pelagic stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014). The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock has only limited overlap with the longline fishery, but there are no observers in the nearshore fisheries, and thus no bycatch estimates are available. Longline fisheries occur throughout the central and western tropical Pacific, and similar interactions with False Killer Whales occur in other regions (e.g., Indian Ocean, Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2010, Anderson 2014; American Samoa, Bradford and Forney 2014; Mediterranean, Bearzi 2002; western North Atlantic, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). Observers on Spanish longline vessels documented two bycaught False Killer Whales off the Azores in 2006 in approximately 810,000 observed hooks (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008), a rate similar to the Hawaii-based longline fishery. The incidental catch rate (including animals hooked but released alive) was estimated from 1992-2005 from observers in the Spanish longline fleet at 1.464, 1.685, and 0.797 individuals per million hooks for the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, respectively (Ramos-Cartelle and Mejuto 2008.) Observer programs to monitor bycatch in fisheries in most parts of the world are limited (if they exist at all), but given what is known regarding both the abundance of False Killer Whales and their predilection to take fish off lines, there is certainly potential for bycatch to result in population declines.</p>  <p>Based on observer reports, False Killer Whales were the most frequently reported species of cetacean killed in the tropical western and central Pacific purse seine fishery in 2009, with an estimated mortality of 281 (SPC-OFP 2010). Interactions with this fishery were observed within the EEZs of Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Nauru, and in international waters. Mortality of False Killer Whales has been documented in Chinese purse seine fisheries in the western Pacific (Dai <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, the only mortality documented in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery since 2001 was in 2010 (IATTC 2011).<br/><br/>Incidental takes of small numbers of False Killer Whales in gill nets have been documented off northern Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Ghana, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Japan, Republic of Korea, and China (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2014, Song 2018). Wang <em>et al</em>. (2013) noted that entanglement in large-mesh drift gillnets is likely responsible for most False Killer Whale fishery-related mortality off eastern Taiwan. Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported on cetacean bycatch rates in Chinese coastal fisheries (trawl, gill, and stow nets), which may number in the hundreds per year for False Killer Whales alone.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales have been taken in drive and harpoon fisheries in a number of areas, either for meat or oil, or to reduce populations due to real or perceived fishery conflicts. At least in some areas, the numbers taken have likely reduced local populations. False Killer Whales are occasionally taken at Saint Vincent in the Caribbean for meat and cooking oil (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Considerable numbers of False Killer Whales have also been killed in a past drive fishery in the Penghu Islands of Taiwan (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995). Official catch records were not recorded until 1972, but from 1958 to 1960, 900 individuals were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu (Kasuya 2017). From 1972 to 2008, 2,643 were reported killed in all fishery types (including bycatch) in Japan, with the highest number in one year of 637 in 1978 (Kasuya 2017). Abundance for coastal Japan was estimated at 2,029 (Kasuya 2017), so this one-year take would have represented approximately 31% of the coastal population as estimated from 1983 to 1991. Over 1,500 were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu between 1972 and 1993, with peak mortality occurring from 1978 to 1983 when 1,358 were reportedly taken (Kasuya 2017). Smaller numbers (171) were killed in a drive fishery at Izu on the east coast of Honshu from 1978 to 1996 with 123 taken in 1978 (Kasuya 2017), and 79 were killed in a crossbow fishery in Okinawa between 1993 and 2011 (Kasuya 2017). False Killer Whales have also been killed in the drive fishery at Taiji on the west coast of Honshu, with 586 killed between 1982 and 2011 and up to 91 killed in a single year (Kasuya 2017). Quotas are in place in Japan for drive and crossbow fisheries although those quotas have only rarely been reached in recent years (Kasuya 2017). Some of the animals caught in the Japanese and Taiwanese drive fisheries have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Deliberate shooting in response to depredation may also occur in a number of areas. Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted, for example, that in Hawaii fishermen have reported shooting at False Killer Whales or other dolphins in response to depredation. Anderson (2014) noted that False Killer Whales are likely being shot by tuna longline fishermen in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although there is considerable controversy regarding the absolute extent of declines, there is good evidence of large-scale reductions in many predatory fish populations (e.g., Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Sibert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Polacheck 2006), including Yellowfin and Bigeye Tuna in the western and central Pacific (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2009; Langley <em>et al</em>. 2009). In addition to overfishing, expansion in the extent of unproductive areas and other ecosystem changes (e.g., Polovina <em>et al</em>. 2008, Coll <em>et al</em>. 2008, Koslow <em>et al.</em> 2015) have the potential to influence fish populations at multiple trophic levels. The effects of such reductions of fish populations and subsequent ecosystem changes on populations of False Killer Whales worldwide are unknown but could have resulted in population declines.<br/><br/>Studies of persistent organic pollutants in the main Hawaiian Islands insular population have revealed that all adult males and a number of adult females sampled from the population have levels of PCBs that exceed thresholds thought to cause immunosuppression (Ylitalo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Foltz <em>et al</em>. 2014). Evidence from stranded individuals of several similar species indicates that they have swallowed discarded plastic items, which may eventually lead to death (e.g. Scott <em>et al</em>. 2001); False Killer Whales may also be at risk from this threat.</p><p></p>","<p>Density of False Killer Whales is highest in low latitudes; in the eastern North Pacific, for example, density drops by an order of magnitude north of approximately 15°N (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). Abundance estimates are available for a number of areas, and in general False Killer Whales are among the least abundant delphinids even in their highest density areas (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Ballance and Pitman 1998). In the eastern tropical Pacific, in an area of 19.1 million km², False Killer Whale abundance was estimated as 38,900 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.64) based on line-transect surveys from 1986-1991 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). In the western North Pacific, in an area of 2.9 million km², abundance was estimated as 16,668 (CV 0.26) based on line-transect surveys from 1983-1991 (Miyashita 1993). Kasuya (2017) subdivided this estimate based on region, and noted for coastal Japan (30°-42°N and west of 145°E) the abundance was estimated as 2,029 (95% confidence interval (CI) 907-4,541). In the Gulf of Mexico, there are three False Killer Whale abundance estimates based on line-transect surveys: 381 (CV 0.62) for 1991-1994, 1,038 (CV 0.71) for 1996-2001, and 777 (CV 0.56) for 2003-2004 (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). For U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic, abundance was estimated as 442 (CV 1.06) based on a survey in 2011 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the western Indian Ocean, the False Killer Whale ranked 11th out of 13 species of delphinids in relative abundance (Ballance and Pitman 1998), based on a line-transect survey in 1995. Abundance off New Zealand was estimated as 111 individuals based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identification data collected during 2005-2012 (Zaeschmar 2014).<br/><br/>The only region where abundance estimates have been apportioned by stock is within the U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago. The abundance estimate for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identified animals was 167 individuals (standard error 23) in 2015 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). This is the only population where trend information is available, and several lines of evidence suggest that abundance in the 1980s was much higher, likely in the 400-700 range (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2009, Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), which would indicate a substantial long-term decline. More recent trend (i.e., 2000s through 2015) is unknown due to the variability associated with recent abundance estimates (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). Abundance of the insular stock in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, in an area of 0.4 million km², was estimated as 552 individuals (CV 1.09) based on a line-transect survey in 2010 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The abundance of the pelagic stock within the entire U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago (an area of 2.3 million km²) was estimated as 1,540 individuals (CV 0.66) based on a 2010 line-transect survey although vessel attraction was not accounted for and this therefore may have led to overestimation of abundance (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Although no abundance estimate was given, Anderson (2014) noted that the numbers of False Killer Whales around the Maldives had decreased over a 20-year period and that it may have been due to interactions with longline fisheries in the area.<br/><br/>The generation length for False Killer Whales was estimated at 25 years by Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010), thus three generations is 75 years. The only subpopulation with sufficient evidence to assess trends over more than one generation is the main Hawaiian Island insular population, where there is evidence of a greater than 50% decline in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>",Unknown,"False Killer Whales are found in tropical to warm temperate zones, generally in relatively deep, offshore waters in all three major oceans. Densities are much higher in tropical regions and movements into higher latitudes may be associated with warmer currents, or they could be seasonal (Zaeschmar 2014). False Killer Whales do not generally range into latitudes higher than 50° in either hemisphere. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas and bays, including the Sea of Japan, Bohai/Yellow Sea, Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf, but they are observed only occasionally in the Mediterranean Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017, Baldwin <em>et al</em> 1999, Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1989). There are a few records for the Baltic Sea, which are considered extralimital (Aguayo 1978).","<p>False Killer Whales are taken in hand-harpoon and drive hunts as well as small-type whaling (with a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size limit) in Japan (Kishiro and Kasuya 1993, Kasuya 2017). They are also hunted at least opportunistically in Indonesia (Barnes 1991) and the West Indies (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Quotas remain for takes of False Killer Whale in drive fisheries and hand-harpoon fisheries in Japan (Kasuya 2017). Although there is no legal hunting of False Killer Whales in the Republic of Korea, meat from False Killer Whales has been represented in markets at significantly higher rates than expected based on reports of bycaught animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006). Based on their analysis, Baker <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggested that the False Killer Whales must be killed at a rate 10-times greater than the reported bycatch.<br/><br/>Some of the animals caught in the drive hunt or bycaught in Japan have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984) and a few were live-captured in California and Hawaii as recently as the 1970s (Reeves and Leatherwood 1984).</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p>The False Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).<br/><br/>The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (subpopulation) was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2012. A number of “biologically important areas” have been recognized for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2015). Critical habitat for this stock was designated in 2018 as part of a settlement from a lawsuit. Both the Hawaiian pelagic stock and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock are subjects of a False Killer Whale Take Reduction Plan as required by the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act that went into effect in 2013, in an attempt to reduce bycatch in the Hawaii-based longline fisheries to a level below its calculated potential biological removal. The Take Reduction Plan includes both gear changes (mandating “weak” circle hooks with a maximum wire diameter of 4.5 mm and “strong” branchlines, with a minimum diameter of 2.0 mm) as well as handling guidelines to try to allow hooks to straighten, releasing animals from the gear. In addition, prior to the Take Reduction Plan the longline exclusion area around the main Hawaiian Islands would seasonally contract towards the islands for four months of the year, but the Take Reduction Plan removed that seasonal shift, thus reducing overlap between the longline fishery and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock. Overall however, as of April 2018, serious injury and mortality rates in the Hawaii-based longline fishery (with the vast majority from the Hawaii pelagic stock of False Killer Whales) had not declined.</p><p></p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Therefore, this species is listed as Data Deficient.","<em>Microphis ocellatus </em>inhabits slow-moving freshwater in perennial streams and rivers (Pethiyagoda 1991). Little is known about the species' feeding, but it likely preys on small benthic and/or planktonic crustaceans similar to other pipefishes (Kendrick and Hyndes 2005). They are ovoviviparous, and males brood embryos under their trunk prior to giving birth to live young (Breder and Rosen 1966, Dawson 1985). They grow to a maximum length of 12.5 cm and males brood once they reach 8.5 cm (Dawson 1985).<br/><br/>It occupies the upper middle strata of the water column along the sides of the rivers and usually occurs among marginal weeds and roots.","The threats to this species are largely unknown.

On Lord Howe, it breeds in forest, as once did the population of Norfolk Island, so the Phillip Island population is atypical, burrows being in eroded cliffs of soft volcanic tuff (Priddel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). It is a winter breeder, with birds from Phillip Island breeding at the same time as Lord Howe Island (Priddel et al. 2010). Adults arrive at Phillip from mid-April, a single egg is laid mid- to late May, hatching starts mid-July, and chicks are near-fledged by early November (Bester <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Priddel<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2010). Adults land during daylight, often about 15.30 h (Priddel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). A study on Lord Howe Island in 2000-2001 determined 54% breeding success in burrows visited twice and contents not handled, with 34-36% success in burrows repeatedly visited (Bester<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2007). Nests closest to burrow entrances had lowest breeding success, with the main causes of failure being flooding and predation of eggs and chicks by the endemic, threatened Lord Howe Woodhen&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hypotaenidia sylvestris</span> (Bester <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). A study in 2008 on Lord Howe Island found the breeding success in a small lowlands population to be three times higher (58%; n = 104) than in populations on Mount Gower (15%; n = 33) (D. Binder <em>unpubl. data</em>). Additionally, adult provisioning trips were between 2–12 days (mean 4.8), with no evidence of a bimodal distribution of long and short trips (Binder <em>et al. </em>2013). The adults feed predominantly on squid and fish with crustaceans less important. The most important prey item is bioluminescent fish from the genus <em>Electrona</em>; maximum diving depths have been recorded at 5 m (Bester 2003)<strong></strong>. It also scavenges for food taking fish offal and has been recorded scavenging on a Shining Bronze-cuckoo <em>Chalcites lucidus&#160;</em>(Bester 2003)<strong></strong>. It only occasionally follows fishing boats (Kuroda 1955, Bester 2003),<strong></strong> but some fishing material has been reported in their diet (Bester 2003)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","<p>This species is at risk from flooding due to heavy rains and the flooding of burrows represented the main cause of breeding failure on Lord Howe Island in the 2000 and 2001 breeding seasons (Bester <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although flooding is unlikely to kill adult birds, it kills eggs and chicks through chilling and can weaken burrows, causing them to collapse (Bester <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p>  <p>The native Lord Howe Woodhen is known to prey on eggs and young chicks and is known to be a significant source of nesting mortality (Bester <em>et al</em>. 2007). Wedge-tailed Shearwaters are also problematic, known to evict smaller petrels from burrows, they have been seen to kill chicks in the small population on Phillip Island (Priddel <em>et al.</em> 2010). Invasive and introduced species have also been a problem in the past, however, wild pigs, cats and goats have been successfully eradicated from Lord Howe Island (Department of the Environment and Energy 2015). Rat predation accounts for a small proportion of breeding failures each year (Bester <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2007). The rat population on Lord Howe is being controlled by baiting, with some plans to eradicate them in the future. If rat eradication does occur, introduced masked owls may switch to preying on petrels, potentially causing problematic declines (Bester <em>et al.</em> 2007), for this reason there are plans for the eradication of this species on Lord Howe (Milledge <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>  The Providence Petrel is at risk from drowning due to entrapment in fishing gear, however, this is not thought to be a significant source of mortality (Bester <em>et al</em>. 2007). Hunting is known to have severely affected the Norfolk Island population in the past, possibly causing its extirpation (Medway 2002), but is thought to be unlikely to return. Plastic ingestion may also represent a threat, with plastic found in the stomachs of over 10% of the birds sampled (Bester <em>et al.</em> 2010), however, this is not known to have any adverse consequences.<p></p>","During the 2002 breeding season the estimated the Lord Howe Island population was estimated at just over 32,000 breeding pairs (Bester 2003)<strong></strong>. Current estimates for the Phillip Island population&#160;are at 10-100 pairs (Priddel&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010) with 250 burrows counted in 2011 (N.

It was exterminated on Norfolk Island itself between 1790 and 1800, where it was once considered numerous. One million adults and young were harvested for food from 1790-1793 and numbers dropped to 15,000 by 1796, with complete extermination by 1800 (Priddel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). The population on Lord Howe Island was estimated at 20,000 breeding pairs in the 1970s (Fullagar <em>et al.</em> 1974);&#160;however a more comprehensive survey during the 2002 breeding season estimated the population at just over 32,000 breeding pairs (Bester 2003)<strong></strong>. Surveys also determined that its distribution has likely increased since the eradication of pigs on Lord Howe Island and it appears to be establishing itself in the lower elevations south of Mt Lidgbird (Bester 2003)<strong></strong>. The Phillip Island population was discovered in 1985 and numbered at least 20 birds, with current estimates of 10-100 pairs (Priddel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010) with 250 burrows counted in 2011 (N.

Therefore, it is listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","The species breeds in steep and extremely rugged terrain at 160-1,200 m. It usually nests in burrows associated with the root structure of trees, including Ohia lehua (<em>Metrosideros polymorpha</em>) and a dominant understory of densely matted uluhe fern (<em>Dicranopteris linearis</em>) in montane mesic forests on steep slopes (<strong></strong>Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007). In general, it can nest in any habitat that is free of predators (Troy <em>et al. </em>2016, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>The breeding season begins in April, when birds return to prospect for nest sites and, following an exodus in late April, egg-laying in early June is highly synchronised (NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Pairs produce one egg, which is incubated for an average of 53-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 81-94 days (NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Most young fledge by November (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The age at first breeding is around six or seven years (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The species's diet is not well known, although it likely consists of fish and squid,&#160;particularly flyingfish and Purpleback Flying Squid (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ainley <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong></strong>. It forages for hundreds of kilometres offshore, often in large, mixed species flocks associated with schools of large, predatory fish that drive prey species to the ocean surface (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>","<p>The main threat to this species is thought to be predation by non-native species (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 1999, Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005, NSWG 2005). Predation of adults and juveniles by feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> and Barn Owls <em>Tyto alba</em> has been documented on almost every colony on Kaua'i, including the most remote sites (NSWG 2005, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans</em>, Black Rats <em>R. rattus</em>, Brown Rats <em>R. rattus</em> and House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> were inadvertently introduced to the Hawaiian islands as a result of human activity and shipwrecks (Duffy 2010) and may depredate eggs and chicks (NSWG 2005). Brown Rats appear to be more associated with human settlement and do not appear to be as severe a threat as the other two introduced rat species (Raine <em>et al</em>. 2017). Another potential predator, the Small Indian Mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, has recently been discovered on Kaua'i (NSWG 2005), and could potentially be a greater threat than cats as its smaller size means it may be able to enter breeding burrows more easily (Duffy and Capece 2014). It is yet to establish a permanent presence on the island (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2016), although it has a history of incursions onto Kaua'i and one was trapped there in 2016 (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt</em>. 2016). When the Two-spotted Leafhopper <em>Sophonia rufofascia</em> first established on the Hawaiian Islands, it led to habitat loss through feeding on the Uluhe Fern D<em>icranopteris linearis</em> which provide cover for shearwater burrows (Cooper and Day 1998). The leafhopper was a cause for great concern not only for shearwaters, but also for agricultural crops and native flora; hence a biological control programme was initiated and the insect is now hard to find on Hawai'i (Coll and Wajnberg 2017). Dogs have been shot at Ka'ena Point, while attacking nestling albatrosses and shearwaters (Duffy 2010), but the scale of their impact is unknown. Habitat loss due to conversion and introduction of herbivores like domesticated goats and pigs pose another threat on the Hawaiian Islands (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2012), and have been suggested as a contributing factor for the recent abandonment of some colonies (Troy and Holmes 2008, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>On Kaua'i, hurricanes Iwa and Iniki devastated the forests in 1982 and 1992, dramatically reducing available nesting habitat and reducing breeding attempts for Newell’s Shearwaters (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Given that a large proportion of the population breeds on Kaua'i, catastrophic events, like hurricanes, represent a serious threat (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>During the 1980s and 1990s an estimated 70 adults and 280 subadults each summer, and at least 340 fledglings each autumn, died as a result of collisions with power-lines and communications towers, or indirectly because of light attraction (Podolsky <em>et al.</em> 1998, Anon. 2007). In the surveyed areas on eastern and southern Kaua'i, 350 adults are reported dead each year from collisions with power lines (Podolsky <em>et al.</em> 1998). Fledglings on their first flight to the ocean are particularly susceptible to attraction to artificial light. The birds are attracted and disoriented by coastal street lights and once grounded, unable to fly and often killed by cars, cats or dogs, or die from starvation or dehydration (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005). Between 1978 and 1981, more than 5,000 individuals were grounded on Kaua'i, and more than 30,000 have been found as victims of fallout since 1971 (Anon. 2007, Griesemer and Holmes 2011). Intense rescue programmes have been initiated to find grounded birds and return them to the sea (Everett and Pitman 1993). On Kaua'i, approximately 1,500 fledglings are recovered annually after becoming grounded (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005), although with the suspected steep population decline on Kaua'i, the number of grounded birds is expected to have decreased proportionately (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Collision with artificial structures (such as powerlines and wind turbines) is another key threat to the species, particularly in flight corridors for subadult and adult birds accessing inland colonies. Nine communications towers have recently been constructed on the Hawaiian Islands without proper consultation, and these are now the subject of an ongoing lawsuit (Anon. 2007). A field of wind generators was planned for Kaua'i and Lana'i (Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 2009 <em>in</em> Duffy 2010), without accounting for the potential impacts on this species. Although wind farms have been shown to have only minor effects on other bird species elsewhere, night-flying Shearwaters may be particularly vulnerable and the cumulative effects of construction and maintenance, erosion, vegetation clearing and noise should be accounted for (Duffy 2010). It is not confirmed whether the wind farm projects will be realised (T. Holmes <em>in litt</em>. 2007, A. Raine <em>in litt.</em> 2016).</p>  <p>Plastic pollution poses yet another threat. On Kaua'i, 50% of Newell’s Shearwater fledglings necropsied during 2007–2014 contained plastic items in their digestive tract and there is evidence that the mass and the number of items ingested per bird have also increased since the 1980s (Kain <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is thought that consumption of even small quantities of plastic, including fibres and small fragments, exposes birds at all stages of the breeding cycle to plastic-associated co-pollutants and associated impacts survival (Kain <em>et a</em>l. 2016).</p>  On Hawai'i, cinder mining has resulted in habitat loss at several colonies (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1983 <em>in</em> Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997, Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005) and together with other causes of habitat degradation (invasive vegetation, agriculture and urbanisation) contributes to the exposure and increased predation of ground-nesting birds (Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997). The species is also likely to be impacted by the commercial fishery through bycatch and indirect ecosystem effects resulting from overfishing of tuna <em>Tunnus</em> spp. (Mitchell <em>et al. </em>2005, Waugh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<p></p>","There have been several population size estimates for this species (see  Griesemer and Holmes 2011), but the most recent gives a minimum  population estimate of 27,011 individuals (Joyce 2016), which roughly equates to 18,000 mature individuals. However, given the decline on Kauai and near extirpation from Maui, the population size could now be far smaller (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016). The population size is therefore precautionarily placed in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Puffinus newelli</em> nests principally on the mountains of Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>). Small colonies exist on Moloka'i, Hawai`i and possibly Maui, with unconfirmed records from Lana`i. After not having been recorded on Oahu since the 1700s, a survey carried out in 2016-2017 located the species in two sites at Mount Kaala and at Poamoho, suggesting that it regularly visits or even breeds on the island (Young <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In the late 1970s, a cross-fostering experiment was carried out at Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge (Kaua'i), in which 90 eggs were placed in nests of the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (<em>A</em><em>rdenna pacifica</em>) (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. Subsequently, 30 young were fledged. Four breeding pairs nesting in 2006 were believed to be descendents of fostered birds (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. Between 2006 and 2013, colony calls were played at the Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge and artificial burrows constructed to attract nesting pairs, as there is a low threat from alien predators or collisions with artificial structures (Anon. 2007). Subsequently, up to 13 pairs have been recorded there (N. Holmes and A. Raine&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. After the construction of a predator-proof fence in 2015 within the Refuge, 8 chicks were translocated to the site from montane colonies and were raised to fledging (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is planned to translocate up to 50 chicks to the Refuge over a five year period (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Also since 2015, social attraction has also been employed in an attempt to save the population on Maui. While the results are looking favourable, it is too soon to evaluate success (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>In total, predator control and monitoring activities are in place at six colonies on Kaua'i, which involve the control of cats, rats, pigs and Barn Owls as well as monitoring the effectiveness of these activities through the use of cameras and acoustic monitoring devices (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). On Kauai', Barn Owl control is also carried out at another five colonies located along the Na Pali coast, Kalaheo/Kahili and Hanalei valley (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). The effectiveness of Barn Owl control is being monitored through the deployment of acoustic recording devices via helicopter in management areas (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>There is an active programme to control lights across Kaua'i. Building's lighting has been effectively re-designed to reduce collisions (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006 under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has enforced a campaign, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua`i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. In the course of the campaign, also street lights are darkened or turned off by the island's electricity company.&#160;<br/><br/>Moreover, the electricity company of Kaua'i has started incorporating a range of  measures to reduce powerline collisions, including moving lines  underground, lowering them, fitting diverters and testing a ‘laser  fence’ on key lines to make them more visible to birds moving at night  (Griesmer and Holmes 2011, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Several lawsuits have already been brought forward for violations under the Endangered Species Act (Harrison 2009), including against a hotel which was responsible for over one quarter of all birds downed as a result of light pollution. However, there is still a considerable amount of infrastructure that needs to be modified. It is not expected that the threat posed by artificial lighting will ever be completely eliminated (N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Yet overall, significant improvements have been made to reduce light attraction and collision (N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>.  Over 30,000 downed birds have been rescued and released through the  Save Our Shearwaters programme since 1979 (Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017),  although few of  these birds have subsequently been found again (NSWG 2005, D.

The current rate of decline is thought to represent a minor improvement on that over the past three generations but remains very rapid and it still qualifies at the level of Endangered based on the estimated/projected current and future three-generation rate of population reduction. A number of factors are driving the decline, including habitat loss in its breeding, passage and wintering grounds, compounded by disturbance, pollution, and the effects of climate change, however the impact of indiscriminate shorebird hunting appears to be the most immediate and severe threat. Juvenile recruitment has, until recently, been very low, leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly. Extensive conservation work has likely driven the slowing rate of decline, but much more work is required to prevent the extinction of this species.<p></p>  <p></p>","The species has a very specialised breeding habitat, using only lagoon spits with crowberry-lichen vegetation or dwarf birch and willow sedges near lakes and marshes, together with adjacent estuary and mudflat habitats that are used as feeding sites by adults during nesting. It may also use stream-deposited gravel pits (Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species has never been recorded breeding further than 5 km (and exceptionally once 7 km) from the sea shore. Breeding birds are very site-faithful. It breeds either in single pairs or loose aggregations (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. It nests in June-July (Tomkovich 1992, 1995,&#160;Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2020), with failed breeders potentially leaving on migration before others (Zhang Lin 2016). During winter, it prefers mixed sandy tidal mudflats with an uneven surface and very shallow water, mainly in the outermost parts of river deltas and outer islands, often with a higher sand content and thin mud layer on top. In the areas with total coastal conversion, it favours certain stages in the management of saltpans (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The species uses a&#160;variety of feeding techniques that includes a larger variety of food items across the range, including terrestrial insects, small seeds, larvae of beetles and small aquatic amphipods (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2018, Van Gils&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Evidence to support suspicions that immature birds spend their first summer on the wintering grounds until their second year come from ringing recoveries (Tomkovich 1995, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2010a), photographs of a  second calendar-year bird in Thailand in July 2010 (G. Chutima<em> in litt</em>. 2010) and another individual in Bangladesh in June 2015 (S. U. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016),&#160;as well as oversummering and passage birds in the Rudong mudflats (Clark&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Zhang&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;<p></p><p></p>","Throughout its migratory and wintering ranges, tidal flats are being reclaimed for coastal development (industry, leisure, infrastructure, aquaculture and agriculture) and are becoming increasingly polluted. The important staging area at Saemangeum and Geum estuary, South Korea, including the Mangyeung and Tongjin estuaries, has already been reclaimed, and remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2008). Since the reclamation at Saemangeum in 2007, only an average of a single individual has been recorded, in contrast to 'hundreds' prior to the development (Lee <em>et al. </em>2018). Plans for a large-scale reclamation project on the Tiaozini Sandbanks, (part of the Rudong mudflats) were feared to threatened over 60,000 ha of mudflats used by the species by 2020 (Moores 2015,&#160;J. Li and M. Tong to C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017), and elsewhere at Rudong new seawalls were being built in 2015 (Zöckler 2015, Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). However, the national announcement of an end to the reclamation of intertidal land in January 2018 (Anon. 2018, Lei 2018) appears to be a dramatic shift towards alleviating new impacts from this threat and these sites are included in the World Heritage Site nomination.<br/><br/>Smooth Cord-grass&#160;<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>&#160;is an invasive plant used to stabilise mudflats to assist in reclamation along the Chinese coast and rapidly leaves intertidal areas unsuitable for Spoon-billed Sandpipers, dramatically reducing habitat availability (Menxiu <em>et al. </em>2012, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017). At both Rudong and Dongling, <em>Spartina </em><em>alterniflora</em> has formed dense stands with considerable spread noted between spring 2014 and autumn 2015 (Peng <em>et al. </em>2017), and it has also been found on Leizhou mudflat (V. Fu&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2017). The Rudong mudflats are also&#160;the site for development of the largest wind farm in Asia, which could prove to be another threat to this species (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007, 2009, 2010, Li <em>et al. </em>undated)<strong></strong>.&#160;Plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia and cross-dams along the coast of Bangladesh continue to pose threats (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010a, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2011, Zöckler 2015); however, this plan is currently on hold and plans to protect the area have been developed (Zöckler&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009,&#160;<strong></strong>Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009,&#160;Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010b, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler<em> in litt. </em>2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b, Martinez &amp; Lewthaithe 2013)<strong></strong>, and this may be a particularly serious threat to birds wintering on Nan Thar Island and in the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b). A survey of hunting activities in five villages around Sonadia Island, Bangladesh, in September 2010 found that of the 53 hunters interviewed, eight of them claimed to have caught a total of 22 Spoon-billed Sandpipers between October 2009 and April 2010 (Chowdhury 2010). Hunting in the species's non-breeding range could be a crucial factor in the poor rate of recruitment into the breeding population, as immature birds do not return to the breeding areas until they are two years old and thus are more exposed to capture (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b)<strong></strong>. However, recent conservation action aimed at reducing trapping on the wintering grounds appears to have been successful (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014) and may have reduced this significant source of mortality (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016, Aung <em>et al</em>. 2016/2017).&#160;Large-scale wader trapping was observed at Fucheng, south-west Guangdong province, China, where four Spoon-billed Sandpiper were observed in December 2012 (BirdLife Asia 2013), but surveys for the species in south China in January 2017 did not find any illegal mist nets (V. Fu <em>in litt. </em>2017). Monofilament fishing nets set over high tides were found to be a serious problem on the central Chinese coast, with multiple parallel lines of nets set at Tiaozini&#160;in autumn 2015 were found to have captured scores of birds after just one nocturnal high tide, including one juvenile Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Peng <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;Hunting with nets has also been reported from Viet Nam (Long 2015). Recently the scale of hunting in the Russian far northeast has been found to be much greater than previously assumed, and may impact the species during the immediate post-breeding period particularly.<br/><br/>Between August and October 2014, more than a thousand dead wading birds, including two Spoon-billed Sandpipers, were found on the Tiaozini Sandbanks (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017). Tests are ongoing to understand the cause of mortality; however, poisoned bait was discovered in the area.<br/><br/>There are no immediate threats to the breeding grounds, but nests in the vicinity of villages are sometimes destroyed by dogs (<strong></strong>E. Syroechkovskiy <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Poor breeding productivity in recent years has been attributed to heavy nest predation and bad weather (Syroechkovskiy<em> et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>. Significant habitat degradation has been observed in 5 of 30 visited breeding locations (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010)<strong></strong>. Human disturbance, both by residents and researchers, may cause increased levels of nest desertion and predation by foxes and skuas (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Shorebirds, including this species, are also occasionally killed by children with slingshots (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>; one male was also shot by a Russian hunter near the Chinese border in 2008 (Zöckler &amp; Syroechkovskiy 2008)<strong></strong>. Small but significant numbers of birds and their eggs have been collected for scientific purposes in the last 20 years, with one small colony completely wiped out due to this activity (Syroechkovsky 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and other species dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 57% of the breeding habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler &amp; Lysenko 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;Recent observation on the breeding grounds unfortunately confirm a worrying trend of increasing bushes intruding on the coastal tundra habitats in the southern range, as well as drying of the tundra in the northern range with significant&#160;consequences on food access for breeding waders (C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020)<p></p><p></p>","A total of ten repeats of a Lincoln-Peterson method to estimate the global population have resulted in a weighted mean single global estimate of 490 mature individuals (95% confidence limits 360-620) for the six-year period between 2014-2019 (Green <em>et al. </em>2021). However, the most recent winter counts suggest a total number of birds in the order of 330-340 individuals (Zöckler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021), indicating that the total of mature individuals may actually already have fallen below 250 if we assume fewer than three-quarters of these are mature individuals. As such the population is placed within a custom band of 240-620 mature individuals, with a best single value of 490 (Green <em>et al. </em>2021) but noting that this figure may already be outdated.<br/><br/>The trend of these estimates, albeit over a short-time frame, was a mean rate of reduction of 8% (Green <em>et al. </em>2021), similar to the 9% estimated from surveys of the most important wintering population in Myanmar (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010a). However, the confidence interval of the more recent trend estimates overlapped zero, such that there is low confidence in the accuracy of the trend magnitude. In the absence of better information, and noting the congruence with the rate of reduction estimated from wintering surveys, this rate of decline is taken to be the best estimate for the population as a whole for the current timeframe. This rate of reduction is equivalent (using an exponential model of decline) to a three-generation reduction of 68% (over 13.4 years), estimated as a rate of continuing decline of 31.5% in one generation (4.5 years) and 52.7% in two generations (9 years). However, prior to 2009 the rate of population reduction, based on counts of breeding pairs at surveyed locations, was reported to be extremely rapid at an annual rate of 26% between 2002-2008 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010a). As such, the past rate of reduction for the most recent three-generation period (2007-2021) is suspected to have been at a higher rate, and, given the uncertainty, is placed in a band of 70-80%.",Decreasing,"This species has a naturally limited breeding range on the Chukotsk peninsula and southwards to the isthmus of the Kamchatka peninsula, in north-eastern <strong>Russia </strong>(BirdLife International 2001,&#160;Zoeckler &amp; Lappo 2008). It migrates down the western Pacific coast through Russia, <strong>Japan</strong>, <strong>North Korea</strong>, <strong>South Korea</strong>, mainland <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Hong Kong</strong> (China), <strong>Taiwan</strong> (China) and <strong>Viet Nam,</strong> to its main wintering grounds in southern China, Viet Nam, <strong>Thailand</strong>,&#160;<strong>Bangladesh </strong>and <strong>Myanmar </strong>(Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is a vagrant visitor in <strong>Cambodia </strong>and <strong>Indonesia </strong>(during non-breeding seasons here particularly; C.&#160;Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Wintering birds have also been recorded from <strong>India </strong>(with a recent sighting in 2018 possibly the first for 14 years [Roy 2018]), <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, the Fujian province in China (the Min Jiang estuary in Fujian has recently been identified as an important wintering site for the species [F. Cheung <em>in litt. </em>2010, Bai <em>et al</em>. 2015,&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016]), Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China&#160;((Martinez &amp; Lewthwaite 2013,&#160;Fu 2015), and peninsular&#160;<strong>Malaysia</strong>. It occurs regularly at only a few sites within this wintering range, with important sites in Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and China. Sonadia Island and Meghna Estuary (Bangladesh), the Gulf of Martaban and Nan Thar (Myanmar) were believed to support over half of the wintering population (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2018); over 80% of the entire population were considered to winter in Myanmar and Bangladesh (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). However, recent surveys show that the Southern China coast in Guandong and Guanxi Provinces also host significant numbers (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016) and that the numbers in Bangladesh and Myanmar are falling more rapidly than at sites further north along the migratory route (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). It seems likely that the bulk of the population now winters along the Chinese coast.<br/><br/>Records of wintering birds in&#160;Myanmar are of 84 individuals in 2008, 73 in January 2009, and 89 in 2010 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>; 150-220 in the Bay of Martaban in 2010-2012&#160;<strong style=""FONT-WEIGHT: normal"">(</strong>Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2014) and approximately 155 in the upper bay of Martaban in January 2015 (Clark 2015). In 2016, an estimated 100-112 individuals were present in the upper Gulf of Mottama, Myanmar (Aung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, 2020), a reduction from 244 individuals observed in 2009 (Aung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Recent counts reinforce this rapid reduction, with only 47 individuals counted in January 2021 despite high coverage (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>In March-April 2010, a minimum total of 49 individuals were recorded during targeted surveys along the coast of Bangladesh (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2011)<strong></strong>. A new site along the Meghna Estuary was discovered in 2015, which supported a minimum of 48 individuals in February 2016 (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Surveys along the Bangladesh coast from December 2015 to February 2016 found a record number of a minimum of 76 individuals from different sites along the coast, the highest numbers recorded since 1989 in Bangladesh (Chowdhury 2016). However since 2016 numbers located in Bangladesh in winter have fallen rapidly, with fewer than ten counted in January 2021 (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>During the winter of 2015-2016, it was estimated that 10 adults used the Gulf of Thailand (K. Sutasha <em>in litt</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>China Coastal Waterbird Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2013 (Bai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) identified the following sites as of international importance for the species: Yalu Jliang estuarine wetland (Liaoning), Rudong coast (Jiangsu), Dongtai coast (Jiangsu), Dongling coast (Jiangsu), Minjiang Estuary National Nature Reserve (Fujian), Dadeng Island and Weitou Bay (Fujian) and Xitou coast (Guangdong).&#160;<br/><br/>A total of 61 individuals was recorded wintering in southern China (present at ten of 36 surveyed sites) in the January 2021 coordinated surveys (Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance&#160;2021). The Leizhou Peninsula has been identified as an important area, holding about 50 birds (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016, C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2016): 33 were counted in January 2021&#160;(Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance&#160;2021).<br/>&#160;<br/>China is of primary importance during post-breeding and migration periods. It is likely that a large proportion of the adult population of the species spends time at Rudong, China, in both autumn and spring (Menxiu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is currently the only known moulting site for the species (Bai <em>et al</em>. 2015, Peng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Counts of up to 103 individuals at Rudong in October 2011, 106 in October 2012, 140 in October 2013 (Zöckler and Li 2013), a minimum of 226 in September 2014 and 177-190 in October 2014 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2015) are likely to have accounted for a substantial proportion of the global population (M. Tong <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). A maximum of 100 birds were recorded on the Tiaozini mudflats (part of the Rudong mudflats), Dongtai County, in October 2014 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2015), with more than 100 birds recorded at Tiaozini in October 2015 (Li and Chowdhury 2016). A survey in May 2015 on the Rudong mudflats recorded at least 62 individuals, including a number of head-started birds (Phillips 2015). Modelling work has shown Rudong to be too far for the species to reach in a single flight from its breeding grounds and work is underway to identify another stopover site in the Russian Far East (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Due to its specialised breeding habitat requirements, it was probably always a scarce species, but numbers dropped rapidly, at least between 2000 and 2010 (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Surveys on the breeding grounds revealed a dramatic decline from 2,000-2,800 pairs in the 1970s (which assumes equal distribution of the species and may have potentially excluded unknown sites; C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2019) to fewer than 1,000 pairs in 2000, 402-572 pairs in 2003, 350-380 pairs in 2005 (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong> and not more than 150-320 pairs in 2008. The breeding population in 2009-2010 was optimistically estimated at 120-200 pairs (<strong></strong>Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a<strong></strong>)<strong></strong> in an estimated total population of 500-800 individuals, perhaps indicating an 88% decline since 2002, equating to an annual rate of decline of 26%<strong></strong><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""> </span>(Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a)<strong></strong>. These declines have taken place across all known breeding sites, and it is unlikely that significant colonies remain undiscovered (<strong></strong>Zöckler 2005, <strong></strong>Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Declines were also observed at wintering grounds. For example, no birds were sighted wintering in Viet Nam in 2009 at a site that supported at least 27 birds in the mid 1990s (E. Syroechkovskiy <em>et al. in litt.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. However, over the last few years (2013-2015), there are signs that active conservation interventions may have stemmed this rapid population decline and the small remaining population appears decline at a slower pace of still 8-10% (Aung <em>et al</em>. 2018,&#160;Aung <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Breeding success is quite low: average productivity was 0.66 young fledged per nest in 2005, and much lower in 2007, and this is compounded by a very low rate of juveniles and adults returning to the breeding grounds. Until recently, the species has had an ageing and rapidly declining population with little recruitment (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2010). For example, data collected on birds at one breeding area from 2003 to 2009 suggest that recruitment into the adult breeding population was effectively zero in all years apart from 2005 and 2007 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a)<strong></strong>. In 2013, for the first time there was no decline detected at the core breeding area of Meinypylgino, where the population was stable at c.10 pairs (Zöckler 2013). In June 2014, an expedition to Russkaya Koshka recorded an increase in the number of breeding territories recovering from a low of 1-2 pairs in previous years (Nitschke <em>et al</em>. 2015), but numbers are still not near levels known from the early 2000s (Tomkovich <em>et al.</em> 2002, C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In July 2011 and 2016, an expedition in Kamchatka located each a previously unknown breeding area for the species (Heritage Expeditions 2016), with around 3 pairs each.&#160;<em></em><p></p>","Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007, 2009,&#160;<strong></strong>Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009,&#160;Bird<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2010, Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010b, Martinez and Lewthaithe 2013). Trapping using monofilament nets is also frequent on the Chinese coast during migration periods and Spoon-billed Sandpipers have been observed being caught (Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I and II. The species has been added to the list as a Class 1 protected species on the National Key Protected Wild Animal List of China: it is forbidden to hunt, capture, kill, sell, acquire and use the species (Choi 2021).  Fourteen sites along the coast of Bohai Gulf and the Yellow Sea in China have been nominated for World Heritage Site status. Protected areas in its breeding, staging and wintering areas include Moroshechnaya and several local wildlife refuges on the Chukotsk peninsula (Russia), Yancheng and Chongming Dongtan (China), Mai Po (Hong Kong), Lanyang estuary (Taiwan, China), Point Calimere and Chilka lake (India), and Xuan Thuy Nature Reserve (Vietnam). In September 2019 the Bird Conservation Society of Thailand completed the purchase of 8 hectares to conserve habitat at Pak Thale, within the Pak Thale-Laem Phak Bia Flyway Network site recognised by the Government of Thailand (Jearwattanakanok &amp; Yong 2019). The Gulf of Mottama (160,000 ha), Myanmar has also been proposed as a Ramsar site and the area belonging to Mon State is soon to be designated (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zöckler 2015). This work across the Gulf of Mottama headed by the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Task Force, with support from the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Rainforest Trust, also ensure sustainable development in line with conservation goals (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is also legally protected under the Wildlife Act of Myanmar, however the law lacks full implementation (Aung <em>et al</em>. 2020). In 2019, the main stop over sites in Tiaozini (Rudong) were also included into the World Heritage Site nomination (C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Hunters within the area have also signed agreements to surrender trapping equipment and engage in alternate livelihoods (Ceci 2017). Work by the group 'SBS in China' recently lead to the local government designating a 10,000 ha area for Spoon-billed Sandpipers in Rudong (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Chinese government have additionally declared a moratorium for future coastal development (P. Insua-Cao <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Shellfish protected areas have also been designated, which will provide suitable feeding habitat for birds and protect local livelihoods. <br/><br/>Annual surveys of breeding sites on Chukotka are undertaken and over 450 adults and young have been ringed on the breeding grounds since 2000 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Annual searches of potential new breeding sites have taken place from 2011 to at least 2013 (Zöckler 2013).&#160;Recent advances on the protection of important site for the species have additionally accelerated. In Myanmar, 2 further Ramsar sites protects the species in&#160;the the Ayeyarwady Delta (50,000 ha) and Nan Thar Island (40,000), with a vast increase in the official protection level, including preparations for the last remaining site in the south of the country to be protected (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). &#160;Since 2018, the government of Chukotka is also supporting the development of a 300,000 ha large protected area that is adequately named the Land of the Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Syroechkovsky 2019).<br/> <br/>A range of awareness and outreach programmes have taken place. Local support groups have been established in some breeding areas and negotiations have taken place to reduce short-term hunting pressure at one of the key wintering sites in Myanmar (Zöckler &amp; Htin Hla 2009, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>. Researchers and a local environmentalist group convinced two villages on Nan Thar Island, Myanmar, to agree to a hunting ban of the species, with a view to develop an ecologically and economically sound alternative in the future (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>. The development of ecotourism at Nan Thar generated extra income for local people and encouraged them to protect the birds (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Bay of Martaban, socio-economic surveys carried out in early 2010 indicated that bird-hunting is undesirable and that most hunters would readily switch to alternative livelihoods if assisted<strong></strong> (BANCA 2010)<strong></strong>. These surveys were swiftly followed by mitigation activities in the same year, in which hunters agreed to stop their activities in exchange for equipment to provide them with an alternative income source, and awareness-raising events and materials were provided for whole communities (BANCA<em> in litt</em>. 2010)<strong></strong>. On the eastern shore of the Gulf of Martaban, 9 out of 15 hunters targeted by the mitigation activities had increased their livelihood status, the remaining six had neither increased nor decreased their livelihood status (BANCA 2012). Conservationists in Bangladesh successfully raised funds to provide hunters with loans so that they could establish new livelihoods, such as farming (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The Bangladesh Spoon-billed Sandpiper Conservation Project conducted a one year awareness-raising project on Sonadia Island, an important wintering site for the species (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). Activities involved former hunters visiting schools to talk about conservation work, film showings, boat races, mural painting and photography exhibitions (S. U. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;In 2011, awareness-raising and advocacy activities including two training workshops took place in schools in China. Schoolchildren living close to the species's breeding grounds in Russia have also been taught about the species and sent letters to other schoolchildren living along the flyway asking them to protect the species (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>A Species Action Plan was produced in 2006 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2008), and updated in 2008 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong> and 2010 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b)<strong></strong>. At the fifth meeting of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership in Cambodia in December 2010, the partners agreed to establish a Task Force for this species, charged with implementing the action plan (Fowlie 2011).&#160;In 2012, the 'Saving Spoony's Chinese Wetlands' project came top in a vote organised by the Disney Foundation, winning $100,000 to support conservation efforts for the species (Clark&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Headstarting, or artificial incubation and captive rearing on the breeding grounds, avoids the high levels of natural predation that occur at egg and chick stage. This significantly increased breeding success, with the number of wild birds fledged increasing by approximately five times per pair (D. Pain&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). In addition, by taking eggs within days of them being laid early in the season, some birds lay a second clutch that they incubate and raise themselves. Headstarting expeditions in 2012 and 2013 have resulted in the release of a total of 25 juveniles from 35 eggs collected (Zöckler 2013). In 2015, 37 eggs were collected for headstarting in Chukotka, of which 35 were fertile (B. Hughes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015). In July 2016, the headstarting programme successfully released 30 fledglings, the most birds released in a single year. 22 chicks from 30 eggs survived to fledging in 2020, but despite continued releases the number of headstarted birds appears to have ceased offsetting the decline at the release site in 2019 (Syroechkovskiy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).<br/><br/>A&#160;captive-rearing and breeding programme started in 2011, when eggs were collected in Chukotka, and the young birds reared in captivity in Russia were subsequently transported to purpose-built conservation breeding facilities at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust headquarters at Slimbridge,<strong> </strong>UK (Pain 2010)<strong></strong>. In 2012, eggs were transported from Chukotka direct to Slimbridge (Pain <em>et al</em>. 2011, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2013). In May 2014 the captive population numbered 25 birds (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). Two pairs of captive birds at Slimbridge started to breed in 2016 (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016). One chick fledged in 2018 but unfortunately died shortly after, but two chicks were successfully reared fledging in 2019 and remain alive in 2021. No further successful breeding has occurred, and in 2020 several of the eight and nine year-old founders of the captive population died, possibly due at least in part to age (Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust 2021).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to develop captive breeding programmes and continue to monitor numbers at known breeding sites and carry out searches of suitable habitat in north Kamchatka. Continue to survey wintering sites to monitor the population and identify key sites in the East Asian Flyway to help ensure their protection. Campaign against the continued reclamation of intertidal mudflats along the entire migration route. Restore reclaimed wetland sites.&#160;Continue to search for stopover sites in the Russian Far East (Clark&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Actively prevent collection of eggs and birds for scientific purposes, museums and private collections. Take measures to ensure that researcher activity does not increase mortality. Ensure effective legal protection of all known breeding sites. Survey existing and potential wintering sites in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Stop hunting and trapping at key sites in Myanmar, Bangladesh and Russia. Ensure awareness-raising activities are maintained in the long-term. Ensure protection of newly discovered sites and existing sites, especially in South Korea. Legally protect it in all range states. Identify and mitigate pressures at breeding grounds. Lobby against plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia, Bangladesh (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury 2012) and protect important sites along the Meghna Estuary, Bangladesh (Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Pursue protected area status for the Bay of Martaban and other coastal sites in Myanmar (BANCA<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2014).

Based on this evidence, it is suspected that the population has declined by at least 20-29% over three generations. Thus the species is classified as Near Threatened.","The Flesh-footed Shearwater mainly occurs in the subtropics over continental shelves and slopes, and occasionally in inshore waters. Individuals also pass through the tropics and over deeper waters when on migration to the North Pacific and Indian Oceans (Brooke 2004). Individuals have been recorded over waters of 13–23°C in the south-western Pacific Ocean (Reid 2002) and over waters of 11–16°C in the northern Pacific Ocean (Reid 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2013). Pairs breed on islands in burrows on sloping ground in coastal forest, scrubland, or grassland (Powell <em>et al.</em> 2007). Nests consist of enlarged chambers at the end of burrows (1-3 metres in length), with the entrance often covered by plant material (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2014).","<p>Records of bycatch in the Australian Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) have been very high; 0.38 birds caught per 1,000 hooks and an estimated 8,972 - 18,490 individuals killed in the period 1998-2002 (Baker and Wise 2005), sufficient to be driving significant declines. Considerable levels of bycatch from gill-nets, purse-seines, longlines and inshore trawl have been recorded across the species’s range (Japan, Australia, Russia and New Zealand) affecting the great majority of the population. Some mitigation methods have been put in place to reduce incidental capture, however the species is repeatedly found to be amongst the seabirds at greatest risk. In Baker and Wise’s (2005) findings, 91% of all birds taken were Flesh-footed Shearwaters. From 1992 to 1996, estimates of seabird bycatch rates on Japanese long-line vessels fishing within the southern Australian EEZ varied between 0.1 and 0.3 birds per 1,000 hooks, with Flesh-footed Shearwaters accounting for around 10% of the observed bycatch (Tuck <em>et al.</em> 2003). An additional 677 Flesh-footed Shearwaters are reportedly taken each year in the Japanese neon flying squid driftnet fishery (Ogi 2008) and 116 in the land-based salmon gillnet fishery (DeGange and Day 1991). In New Zealand, the species is frequently captured in commercial fisheries, ranked as the 3rd (out of 70) most at risk in 2013 (based on estimated annual potential fatalities vs. potential biological removal) (Richard and Abraham 2013), and 5th in 2014 (Richard and Abraham 2014). Mortality in the ETBF has evidently declined in recent years, but this is thought to be largely due to the fishery shifting north in 2006/07 due to a change in the targeted fish species (Reid <em>et al.</em> 2013b). Consequently, high mortality rates in the ETBF may occur again in future years if the fishery returns south. Recreational fisheries bycatch is also likely to be significant (Tennyson <em>et al.</em> 2012). Data on Flesh-footed Shearwater bycatch in the West and South Coast Purse Seine Managed Fisheries in Western Australia (six vessels operated in 2010) suggest up to six adult birds are killed per day per boat (DEF 2005) with more than 512 birds entangled in one season (Dunlop 2007).</p>  <p>Rapid increases in the incidence of plastic ingestion by chicks over the past decade is suspected to be one of the drivers of decline at Lord Howe Island (90% of tested fledglings contained considerable quantities of plastic [Lavers and Bond 2016]) and in other colonies. Preliminary data from New Zealand indicates around 44% of adult birds contain plastic (Robertson <em>et al. </em>2004). Individuals of all ages have been found to suffer lethal effects. A linear relationship between burrow density and plastic fragments suggests this species is particularly vulnerable to plastic pollution (Buxton <em>et al. </em>2013). High levels of heavy metal contamination (silver, aluminium, copper, mercury, arsenic and cadmium) have been detected in multiple populations and may be co-pollutants linked to plastic consumption (Bond and Lavers 2011, Lavers <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lewis 2016).</p>  <p>The habit of nesting and roosting in burrows on the ground also exposes the Flesh-footed Shearwater to interaction with terrestrial predators and other competitors. In the late 1930s, predation by Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> was deemed responsible for completely eradicating a breeding population from mainland Western Australia (Warham 1958). Introduced House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> and Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em> are present in parts of the breeding range and have minor effects on egg and chick mortality, representing an added stress factor on reproductive success (Taylor 2000, Gaze 2000, Pridell <em>et al</em>. 2006). On Breaksea Island, shearwaters compete with rabbits for burrows (Lavers 2015). </p>  <p>Several roads pass through or run adjacent to breeding colonies on Lord Howe Island, and mortalities are frequently reported along the roadsides (Hutton 2003, DECC 2008). The density of carcasses adjacent to roads was 25 times greater than elsewhere in the colony, and an estimated 125 birds were killed on roads during the 2008/2009 breeding season (Reid 2010, Reid <em>et al</em>. 2013a). These rates are sufficient to drive slow population declines (Reid <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2013). The number of cars and tourists are increasing on the Island each year, suggesting this is a growing threat to affected populations. </p>  <p>Extensive areas of Flesh-footed Shearwater habitat have been cleared for residential developments up to the recent past. As a result, the extent of suitable habitat on Lord Howe Island was considerably reduced (down 35% from 37.8 ha in 1978 to 24.3 ha in 2002 [Priddel <em>et al.</em> 2006]), but recent restrictions have been reported to have halted further conversion, despite an apparent continued decline in burrow density (Reid <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p></p>","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt;650,000 individuals, but this has recently been revised downward following the identification of a number of significant errors in the historical literature, as well as recent population surveys. Overall, the current global population is substantially smaller than previously thought, comprising only around 74,000 breeding pairs (Lavers 2015). In Australia, the population on Lord Howe Island had been estimated at c.20,000-40,000 breeding pairs in 1978 (Fullagar and Disney 1981) and 17,462 breeding pairs in 2003 (Priddel <em>et al.</em> 2003). In 2009, the population was estimated at 16,267 pairs (95%-confidence interval 11,649–21,250), representing a decline in the number of pairs of 6.8% since 2003, equalling a decline of approximately 1.3% per annum (Reid <em>et al. </em>2013). In New Zealand, Robertson and Bell (1984) estimated the breeding population at 50,000-100,000 pairs in 1983, while Taylor (2000) considered the population to be at 25,000-50,000 pairs. Recent surveys suggest the population is closer to 10,000-15,000 pairs (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2010, Waugh <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Western Australian population was recently uplisted from Least Concern to Vulnerable (DPaW 2015). Following revision of the breeding population size, the species was recently up-listed to Near Threatened in Australia (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011) and to Nationally Vulnerable in New Zealand (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Decreasing,"This species breeds on St Paul Island (<strong>French Southern Territories</strong>), Lord Howe Island (<strong>Australia</strong>), islands off south-west mainland Australia, south Australia (at two isolated colonies), and islands off North and South Islands (<strong>New Zealand</strong>).

The population is considered to be in decline due to various threats, but the rate of decline is not known. The species is therefore classified as Near Threatened. <br/><p></p>","Markham’s Storm-petrel breeds in dispersed colonies in saline areas, using fissures and holes created by saltpetre deposits for nesting (Tobias <em>et al</em>. 2006, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Paracas, the species breeds in small, dispersed colonies up to 5 km from the sea on sloping ground<strong> </strong>(Tobias <em>et al. </em>2006). The colonies in Chile are located on the east of the Cordillera de la Costa mountain range at up to 50 km distance from the sea (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). In Chile, known colonies are located at 600-1,100 m a.s.l. (Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). Reproduction can be asynchronous within a colony (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Nevertheless, in the northern colonies in Paracas, near Arica and in Salar de Quiuña, most pairs lay eggs between April and August, and are with chicks between July and January (Jahnke 1994, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). Pairs breeding in the colonies of Pampa Perdiz, Salar Grande and Salar de Navidad further south lay eggs between November and January, while chicks hatch between January and April (Malinarich <em>et al</em>. 2018, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). The species feeds opportunistically both inshore and offshore on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (Garcia-Godos <em>et al. </em>2002). Adults arrive at the colonies at least 45 min after sunset (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p></p>","The principle threat faced by Markham’s Storm-petrel is the mining of saltpetre from the salt plain on which it nests (Torres-Mura and Lemus 2013, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). This has resulted in the loss of considerable amounts of breeding habitat, as it destroys the burrows and crevices in which nests are placed (Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Light pollution also represents a significant level of mortality, with 10-20 fresh corpses reported each morning next to a single light close to a breeding colony (Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is assumed that fledglings are attracted to the lights of nearby cities during their first flights (Torres-Mura and Lemus 2013, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015), and already few, strong light sources may affect large parts of a breeding colony (F. Medrano <em>in litt</em>. 2019). It has been estimated that each year around 20,000 fledglings die because of light pollution, representing 1/3 of the entire cohort (F. Medrano <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Light-pollution was found to be a severe threat to seabirds and Hydrobatidae in particular, which can potentially have a detrimental effect on the overall population size (Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further threats include infrastructure developments (roads, wind farms and power lines), military exercises and garbage (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Overall, given the severity of the threats presented by mining and light pollution and their potentially detrimental impacts on the population size, the number of locations of occurrence (as defined by the most severe threat) is assumed to be relatively small.<br/><p></p>","A minimum of 2,305 pairs were present on the Paracas peninsula in 1992<strong> </strong>(Tobias <em>et al. </em>2006). Following the recent discovery of several large breeding colonies in the Atacama Desert (Schmitt <em>et al. </em>2015, Barros <em>et al. </em>2019), the global population was estimated to number c.50,000-60,000 breeding pairs (Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano <em>et al</em>. 2019). This equates to 100,000-120,000 mature individuals, or 150,000-180,000 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"Markham’s Storm-petrel (<em>Hydrobates markhami</em>) occurs in the tropical zone of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Between July and September, it is found over warm, equatorial waters, while between January and July it moves to cooler waters of the Peru Current and further west (Pyle 1993, Spear and Ainley 2007). It breeds on the Paracas peninsula on the coast of central <strong>Peru </strong>and in the Atacama Desert of southern Peru and northern <strong>Chile </strong>(Carboneras 1992, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Paracas, the species forms six breeding colonies (Medrano <em>et al</em>. 2019), which were estimated at a minimum of c.2,300 pairs in 1992 (Tobias <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Chile, several colonies have been discovered recently: near Arica, the species breeds in five colonies, of which two colonies hold fewer than 10 pairs (Pampa Tana, Pampa La Higuera), one colony holds 90 pairs (Pampa Chuño), another colony around 10,000 pairs (Pampa Camarones), and the largest colony around 25,000 pairs (Pampa Chaca; Barros <em>et al.</em> 2019, Medrano <em>et al.</em> 2019). Further colonies were located in Tarapacá and Antofagasta regions: The colony in Salar de Quiuña is estimated at c.400 breeding pairs, the colony in Pampa La Perdiz at c.600 pairs, the colony in Salar Grande at 20,000 pairs and a smaller colony further south in Salar de Navidad at fewer than 10 pairs (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2019, Medrano <em>et al.</em> 2019).

This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016).&#160; This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008).&#160; These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests).&#160;<br/><br/>F<span id=""docs-internal-guid-080c5706-7fff-d2bb-d2f1-971fcbdad5d3"">orest dieback could be an additional threat to this species.

This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016). This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thevakaran<em> et al.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008). These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires, but natural fires are unknown in rainforests where the species occurs. The preponderance of amphibian species in the highlands are <em>Pseudophilautus</em> shrub frogs which, being direct developers, are independent of bodies of standing water.

This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016). This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008). These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests). The preponderance of amphibian species in the highlands are <em>Pseudophilautus</em> shrub frogs which, being direct developers, are independent of bodies of standing water. Instead, they depend on the ambient moisture of the forest for both homeostasis and reproduction. Highland aridification and warming therefore, are serious—if as yet unassessed—potential threats to these species.&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Forest dieback could be an additional threat to this species.

Individuals have commonly been observed near the forest edge with open canopy, and are found in greater abundance in these areas than in closed canopy forest (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012). Observations of breeding behavior indicate that this species does not have a free-living larval stage, however it is unclear if they are foam nesters or a direct developing species (Wickramasinghe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Further studies need to clarify the breeding biology of this species (Wickramasinghe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).

The Induruwa Mukalana and Guruluwana regions became separated due to deforestation between 2002 and 2012 and are now two separate islands. Many isolated forest patches that existed in the area disappeared between 2007 and 2012, having been cleared and converted to human settlements. By 2012, the gravel road which consisted of water holes during the monsoonal rains had been concreted about half the road's length (750 m of the total 1,500 m). This has led to more visitors and more vehicles entering the forest reserve, which also resulted in large quantities of garbage being discarded in the forest, and the remaining temporary water holes drying out quickly when vehicles are driven through them. Forest patches also are being cleared and converted to small tea plantations. Apart from logging, hazardous activities such as gem mining, sand mining, use of agro-chemicals, cutting and burning the forest edge, drying out of water bodies, and soil erosion&#160;are also threats.<br/><br/>Climate change also poses an additional threat to this species, as its range includes&#160;the only perhumid region in all of South Asia where the dry season is short, with an average rainfall of at least 100 mm per month, which explains the regions  biodiversity-rich mixed-dipterocarp forests. While there does not appear to be a negative rainfall trend in this region, warming is predicted to result in reduced surface moisture. While the southwest monsoon rainy period (May-July) is gradually becoming longer, the first intermonsoon (March-April) is yielding less rain, delaying the onset of the rains that follow the December-February dry season. The extended dry period has obvious consequences for non-aquatic amphibians such as the direct-developing species.

For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. <em>Physeter macrocephalus</em> is globally widespread (thus not qualifying as threatened under criterion B), and does not have a global population that warrants listing under criteria C-D. Empirical trend data for this species globally are unavailable. However, commercial whaling at a large scale for this species in the North Pacific and Antarctic within the last three generations (82 years) certainly resulted in a global decline during this period. Commercial whaling for this species has ceased and therefore this population is evaluated under the A1 criterion rather than under the A2-4 criteria. A peer-reviewed publication (Whitehead 2002) provides a model-based estimate of global trend that can be used to evaluate the population under the A1 criterion. The results from that study gave a 6% probability for Endangered, a 54% probability of meeting the Vulnerable category, and a 40% probability of falling into the Near Threatened category. The results suggest little chance that the population would meet the criteria for Endangered or for Least Concern. There is credible and realistic evidence for either the Vulnerable or Near Threatened category. Given that the results give greater probability for at least the Vulnerable category (60%), and that this is the more precautionary category, the species is classified as Vulnerable.","The habitat of the Sperm Whale is the open sea. More specifically, Sperm Whales can be found in almost all marine waters deeper than 1,000 m that are not covered by ice, except in the Black Sea and possibly the Red Sea (Rice 1989; Whitehead 2003). In some areas, particularly in the western North Atlantic, sperm whales, especially males, can occur in shallower waters (e.g., Scott and Sadove 1997). Females and young are usually restricted to waters at latitudes lower than about 40-50º and to areas where sea surface temperatures are greater than about 15ºC (Rice 1989). Sperm Whales are generally more numerous in areas of relatively high primary productivity (Jaquet <em>et al</em>. 1996), although there are some exceptions, such as the Sargasso Sea and the central North Pacific gyre (Barlow and Taylor 2005).<br/><br/>The Sperm Whale is an animal of extremes in size (up to 18 m), sexual dimorphism (mature males have three times the mass of mature females), ecological imprint (sperm whales take roughly the same amount of biomass from the oceans as humans), and many other attributes (Whitehead 2003). The commercial value of the animal (a function of its size and the quality of Sperm Whale oil) drove two massive worldwide hunts: the technologically primitive “open-boat” hunt from 1712-~1920 (Starbuck 1878; Best 1983), and modern whaling using engine-driven whaling ships and harpoon guns from ~1910-1988 (Tonnessen and Johnsen 1982). The complex social structure of sperm whales may have been affected by whaling, lowering potential population growth rates, which are very low anyway (Whitehead 2003). On the positive side, Sperm Whales are very widely distributed (see above), and their primary prey, deep-water squid, are not yet major targets of fisheries.<br/><br/>The generation time (mean age of mothers) for Sperm Whales can be calculated if one assumes a set of population parameters, specifically age at first birth, mortality rate of mature females, and reproductive rate of mature females. There is uncertainty about these parameters, so two calculations were made using different assumptions:<br/><br/>a) Applying the population parameters most recently used for Sperm Whales by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (International Whaling Commission 1982): age at first birth = 10 years; female reproductive rate in unexploited population = 0.20/year; female adult mortality = 0.055/yr): generation time = 27.3 years.<br/><br/>b) The estimates of mortality used by the International Whaling Commission are particularly problematic, and Sperm Whales likely have age-specific survival and reproductive rates. Thus it may be more realistic (Whitehead 2002) to use the well-established mortality schedule of Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 1990) and an age-specific pregnancy rate taken from the sperm whale data presented by Best <em>et al</em>. (1984; pregnancy rate for mature females = 0.257-0.0038xAge in years): generation time = 27.5","The greatest threat to Sperm Whales, extensive commercial whaling, has ceased. However, a number of other threats of various dimensions remain.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales have had a long history of local whaling going back at least to the 1500s and intense commercial whaling beginning around 1712 and continuing to 1988. The “modern” highly mechanised phase was particularly intense around 1950, and at its peak killed around 25,000 whales per year, dramatically depleting the global population. In recent decades, some tens of whales were taken each year from small boats in Indonesia (Reeves 2002), although none have been taken in the last two years (H. Whitehead pers. comm.), and 10 are taken annually by Japan under IWC Special Permit (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, has been a particular problem in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2006), but Sperm Whales die from entanglement in nets and lines in many other areas and in a variety of fisheries as well (e.g., Haase and Félix 1994; Barlow and Cameron 2003). Considering the widespread distribution of Sperm Whales, observations of occasional takes in relatively small scale gillnet fisheries (e.g. Barlow and Cameron 2003) suggest much larger takes in unobserved, unregulated high seas driftnet fisheries such as were common before the 1989 adoption of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly. <br/><br/>Sperm Whales sometimes take fish off fishing gear (most often demersal long-line gear), an activity known as “depredation.” Depredation of long-line catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., South East Alaska, Chile, South Georgia and several other southern ocean island areas, North Atlantic). This interaction has resulted in a few reported entanglements and deaths (e.g. Salas 1987; Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004), and has incurred hostility from some fishermen (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998; Donoghue <em>et al</em>. 2003), including shooting of whales (González and Olivarría 2002).<br/><br/>Sperm Whale tissues have high levels of some contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000); however, any population-level effects on health are unknown. The effects of noise on Sperm Whales are also uncertain. Some evidence suggests that they are highly sensitive to noise (e.g., Watkins <em>et al</em>. 1985; Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1994) while other studies have found little or no effect (e.g., Madsen and Møhl 2000; Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002). To date, all published studies of Sperm Whales and noise focus on short-term behavioural effects. Avoidance of sonar (Dawson pers. comm.) and seismic surveys (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1994; but see Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002) has been observed but no mortality has been documented.<br/><br/>Whaling on Sperm Whales has at various times focussed almost exclusively on one sex or the other. Removals of large numbers of males may have had lingering effects on pregnancy rates in some subpopulations (Best 1979; Clarke <em>et al</em>. 1980; Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997) and large males are noticeably uncommon on some breeding grounds (Whitehead 2003). The removal of large numbers of females from social groups, and of older females in particular, may have lingering, socially disruptive effects. Furthermore, recovery might be inhibited via temporary or permanent loss of social cohesion and of socio-ecological knowledge such as is known to occur in other large-brained, long-lived social mammals (e.g., elephants, Poole and Thomsen 1989). <br/><br/>Maximum rates of increase for Sperm Whale populations are very low, possibly on the order of 1% per year (Whitehead 2002). Population growth/recovery can be expected to be low in the species.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales face other threats at a more regional level. These include collisions with ships (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001), for instance off the Canary Islands (André and Potter 2000) and in the Mediterranean (Pesante <em>et al</em>. 2002), and ingestion of marine debris in the Mediterranean (e.g., Viale <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/><br/>Causes for optimism: On the one hand, the Sperm Whale is not being heavily whaled at present and seems relatively secure from this threat in the short and medium term. When not being actively hunted, the Sperm Whale has rather little interaction with humans: most of its habitat is far from land, and few of its food sources (principally deep-water squid) are of currently harvested (Clarke 1977). Some populations, for instance the animals in the western North Atlantic that were little affected by modern whaling, seem healthy with reasonably high population densities and evidence of satisfactory reproduction (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1998; National Marine Fisheries Service 2000).<br/><br/>Causes for concern: on the other hand, the Sperm Whale, with a maximum rate of increase of around 1% per year (Whitehead 2002), is not well adapted to recover from population depletion. Furthermore, the population model considers only one anthropogenic threat, whaling, and thus posits that the Sperm Whale population has recovered since about 1980 (Fig. 1 in linked PDF document), when large-scale commercial whaling was rapidly coming to an end. This recovery is purely theoretical, and may not be occurring as sperm whales carry high levels of some chemical contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000), ocean noise is increasing (Gordon and Moscrop 1996), interactions with fisheries continue to result in sperm whale deaths (International Whaling Commission 1994), and the lingering, socially disruptive effects of whaling may be inhibiting recovery of this highly social species (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). Some regional populations of sperm whales are declining or are apparently not recovering from depletion. Even in the absence of whaling, the Mediterranean population appears to have declined over the past 20 years, with bycatch in driftnets a likely principal cause (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The southeastern Pacific Sperm Whale population, very heavily whaled during the period 1950-1980, has an extremely low recruitment rate (probably below replacement), perhaps because of the social disruption caused by intense whaling (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). The population of mature and maturing males in the Antarctic was also heavily whaled over the same period, but should have repopulated from less heavily exploited breeding populations at lower latitudes following the end of large-scale commercial whaling. However, systematic surveys of Sperm Whales in the Antarctic showed no substantial or statistically significant increase between 1978 and 1992 (Branch and Butterworth 2001).","The only recent quantitative analysis of sperm whale population trends (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material, which constitutes an integral part of this assessment) suggests that a pre-whaling global population of about 1,100,000 had been reduced by about 29% by 1880 through “open-boat” whaling, and then to approximately 360,000 (67% reduction from initial) by the 1990s through modern whaling, although much uncertainty is associated with all these estimates (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). There is no direct evidence that any part of the population has increased since the end of large-scale whaling in about 1980, although for most areas there is also no direct evidence that they have not. In some areas there is concern that populations are continuing to decline (see below).<br/><br/>The species has a huge geographic range (Rice 1989) and a global population size in the 100,000's (Whitehead 2002; Fig 1). Although there is considerable uncertainty about sperm whale population parameters and levels of exploitation, Whitehead (2002) estimated historical trajectories of sperm whale abundance incorporating many, but not all, sources of uncertainty (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). That model was modified slightly (to produce an endpoint in 2003) and run to estimate the decline in global sperm whale population size between 1921 and 2003 (i.e. over approximately 3 generations; 82yr; see below for estimation of generation time) (H. Whitehead pers. comm.). As sperm whale population size seems to have changed rather little between about 1910-1930 (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material), the calculations are probably quite robust with reference to the estimated generation time. Using the “best” estimates of the model parameters (as in Whitehead 2002), the population in 2003 would have been 44% of that in 1921. Of 1,000 runs using model parameters randomly selected from within reasonable ranges (as in Whitehead 2002), 6% gave populations in 2003 of &lt;30% of that in 1922, 54% gave a 2003 population between 30-50% of that in 1992, and 40% suggested depletion levels of less than 50% over this time.<br/><br/> Arguments can be made that the model results are overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. Factors that would contribute to making the results overly optimistic that are not accounted for in the model include not accounting for under-reporting of illegal Soviet catches in the North Pacific and Antarctica and under-reporting of Japanese catches in the North Pacific (Kasuya and Brownell 2001), other continuing threats (described below), and factors such as continuing effects of social disruption from whaling that might inhibit recovery (consistent with an apparent lack of recovery in many areas). Factors that would contribute to making the results overly pessimistic include the assumption of a relatively low rate of increase in the model and the extrapolation of a relatively high estimate of g(0) (the proportion of whales detected on the trackline) from a single study to the global population. The direction of the effect of other uncertainties in model inputs, including the effects of sex-biased catches, is not certain. Despite these uncertainties, the Whitehead model provides the best available scientific evidence upon which to base this assessment. To reduce these uncertainties, future analyses would need to address the concerns identified above. <br/><br/>Efforts to assess the conservation status of sperm whales and the impact of historical whaling on contemporary structure are compromised by the absence of a good model of sperm whale population structure; pooling data may obscure distinct geographic patterns. While Sperm Whales are known to show long distance movements (Ivashin and Rovnin 1967; Mitchell 1975) and low genetic differentiation among ocean basins, several lines of evidence suggest that sperm whales past and present, have significant geographic structure. Analyses based on historical and contemporary data from tagging records (Rice 1974; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988), blood types (Fujino 1963), catch distributions, sighting patterns, size composition, lack of recovery from exploitation (Japan), timing of pregnancy (Best <em>et al</em>.1984), photo-identification (Whitehead 2003), genetics (Drouot 2004; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999), cultural markers (Rendell and Whitehead 2003) and combinations thereof (Bannister and Mitchell 1980; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988) suggest evidence for structure in many regions. Over the past decade, several authors have investigated population structure in female Sperm Whales using sequence variation within the mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) and/or polymorphic nuclear loci (microsatellites). In general, results tend to find low genetic differentiation among ocean basins and little evidence of subdivision within ocean basins, with the exception of some isolated basins such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (Lyrholm <em>et al</em>. 1999; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999; Drouot <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, factors such as low sample sizes, low mtDNA haplotypic diversity and social structure alone and together reduce the power to detect population structure. In addition, it is clear that biologically discrete populations of odontocetes can occur independently of strong geographic or oceanographic features. Alternative, non-geographic based hypotheses of population structure, such as dialect and differences in diet such as are found in Killer Whales, have not been thoroughly examined. For example, Rendell and Whitehead (2003) suggest that female populations seem to be culturally structured within oceans by “coda” vocalizations and may be genetically distinct (Rendell and Whitehead 2005, Rendell <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Unknown,"The Sperm Whale has a large geographic range (Rice 1989).

Its diet is comprised mainly of planktonic crustaceans, specifically euphausiids and amphipods, early and calanoid copepods during chick-rearing, and it is supplemented with varying amounts of other invertebrates and small fish. Food is usually obtained at considerable distance from colonies. Spring arrival and the start of laying is variable depending on latitude, starting earliest in the south of its range and latest in the extreme north. It is monogamous with high site fidelity and presumably high mate fidelity between years. Colonies are loose and range from small to large, breeding on offshore islands using dark crevices and cavities in steep sea cliffs, rocky talus slopes and beach boulder fields as nesting sites (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).","Climate related trophic shifts appear to have led to considerable declines in the numbers of Parakeet Auklet in Prince William Sound (Agler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999), although whether populations are affected more widely in Alaska is unknown.

The impacts of plastic ingestion are unknown, but birds collected at Buldir showed no relationship between number of plastic pellets in crop and body condition, chicks were not fed plastic by parents (Bond <em>et al. </em>2010) and no population impact has been demonstrated.<br/>Some colonies are suspected of being affected by non-native predators with Arctic <em>Vulpes lagopus</em> and Red Foxes <em>V. vulpes</em> introduced on the Aleutian Islands for fur farming (Bailey 1993) and the accidental introduction of Rats <em>Rattus</em> <em>rattus</em>&#160;to many Alaskan islands. However the species continues to breed on islands where Arctic Foxes are native (Pribilof, St. Matthew and St. Lawrence) and the scattered nature of this species's colonies reduces the likelihood that a small number of predators could severely impact a colony.",The global population is estimated to number 1.4 million mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).,Decreasing,"The Parakeet Auklet is found in the North Pacific Ocean, from Hokkaido, <strong>Japan</strong> and far off the coast of California (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>) in the south, up to and including the southern part of the Chukchi Sea.

The wetland is seasonally flooded with fresh water; the soil consists of swamp and marsh organic deposits. Herbaceous vegetation in this habitat includes the toothed midsorus fern (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Blechnum serrulatum</span>), willdenow's maiden fern (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Thelypteris interrupta</span>), bulltongue arrowhead (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sagittaria lancifolia</span>), flatsedges (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cyperus</span> sp.), spike rushes (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eleocharis</span> sp.), and vines and grasses. The habitat at the type locality occupies ca 180 ha; the species was not found in other wetland sites in the northern coastal plain. Individuals are active between 19:00-22:00 hours, while perching, sitting, or calling on herbaceous vegetation, between 0.4 m and 1.2 m above water level. Calling sites for males were found to be between 0.6 and 1.2 m above ground level.

Embryos hatch after approximately 19 days (Rios-López and Thomas 2007; N. Rios-López pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>This species is thought to have year-round reproduction given the frequency of juveniles found in any given month. However, most adult activity (including calling males) is greater during the warm and wet months (May to November), and diminishes during the cooler and drier months (particularly between the end of January and end of March). It is expected that recruitment rates reflect this seasonal pattern with a greater amount of clutches being produced during the warm and wet months. The seasonal breeding pattern in this frog is similar to that of other species of the genus in Puerto Rico, such as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. antillensis</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. cochranae</span>,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> E. coqui</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. cooki</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. gryllus</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. portoricensis</span>.

Agricultural activities and domestic waste products are responsible for elevated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Jurubatiba National Park (Meire&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Imboassíca Lagoon is highly eutrophic and receives a large output of sewage from Macaé City (Dos Santos Furtado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). Artificial openings have exposed the lagoon to oceanic influence (Dos Santos Furtado 2002). Grussaí is impacted by a large seasonal influx of tourism and urban development, and there is evidence that human activities have altered the trophic function of surrounding habitats (Costa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Relatively high concentrations of mercury has been detected in lagoons and lakes exposed to runoff in northern Rio de Janeiro State, and can likely be attributed to the use of mercurial fungicides on sugar cane plantations up until 1980 (De Sousa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).

In addition to impacts related to navigation, much of the habitat available to the shovelnose sturgeon within its historic range, has also been altered by water resource development projects designed to provide for irrigation, public water supply, public recreation, and the production of electricity. Dams have blocked spawning migrations, isolated populations, destroyed rearing and spawning habitats, and altered food supply as well as changed flow, turbidity and temperature regimes (Dryer and Sandvol 1993).  <br/> <br/>While shovelnose sturgeon roe is used as an acceptable caviar, over-harvest has not yet been a major detriment to the species.  <br/> <br/>Much of the information in this species account was taken with permission from Shovelnose sturgeon, <em>Scaphirhynchus platorynchus</em> by Jerry L. Rasmussen in  ""A Compendium of Fishery Information on the Upper Mississippi River Third Edition 2001"", a publication of the Upper Mississippi River Conservation Committee currently undergoing final review.","Smallest of the sturgeon species in North America, shovelnose sturgeon can tolerate high turbidities and are usually found in the strong currents of main river channels. They are often found over sand and gravel substrates feeding on aquatic insects, mussels, worms and crustaceans. Spawning normally occurs from April through early July with mature shovelnose migrating upriver to spawn over rocky substrates in flowing water between 19–21ºC. Individuals mature after 5–7 years of age, at total lengths of approximately 500 mm and 630 mm for males and females, respectively. Their weight at this age ranges from 0.9–1.3 kg (National Paddlefish and Sturgeon Steering Committee 1992). <br/> <br/>River sturgeon are uniquely adapted to mainstem river systems which are characterized by their large scale, diverse habitats, and a dynamic nature (Beamesderfer and Farr 1997). Adaptations include mobility, opportunistic feeding habits, delayed maturation, longevity, and high individual fecundity. Unfortunately, in recent decades these same life history characteristics have become a handicap to the species and led to population declines because of man-induced habitat fragmentation and destruction (Beamesderfer and Farr 1997).","Alteration of large rivers and construction of locks and dams for navigation purposes has contributed significantly to the decline of shovelnose sturgeon by blocking access to ancestral spawning grounds and by eliminating its requisite lotic habitat.

This may be due to its relatively small size in comparison to lake sturgeon (<em>Acipenser fulvescens</em>) and the pallid sturgeon (<em>Scaphirhynchus albus</em>), the other two sturgeon species found historically throughout its range. Shovelnose are locally abundant in some areas where large river habitat is still fairly intact and modest commercial fisheries occur in a few states where some acceptable riverine habitat still exists (National Paddlefish and Sturgeon Steering Committee 1992). <br/> <br/>Hesse and Carreiro (1997) recorded causes for shovelnose sturgeon decline (as reported to them by state biologists) as habitat degradation, loss of natural hydrograph, sedimentation, channelization, loss of spawning habitat, flood control and navigation dams, artificial water management, water temperature alteration, and past over-harvest. Boreman (1997) noted that sturgeon life history and habitat use attributes make the species highly vulnerable to fishing pressure. Specifically, he attributed this vulnerability to their older age (than most fishes) at full maturity, lower fecundity values, and older age at which 50% of the lifetime egg production is realized with no fishing mortality. <br/> <br/>Shovelnose sturgeon continue to be commercially harvested in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Arkansas closed shovelnose sturgeon to commercial fishing on its state waters of the Mississippi River in 2000, as a measure to reduce the by-catch of endangered pallid sturgeon. Keenlyne (1997) reported the commercial harvest of shovelnose meat and roe in 1992 as follows: <br/> <br/>Arkansas: 14,500 kg meat; 88–110 kg caviar <br/>Illinois: 22,335 kg meat; 77 kg caviar <br/>Indiana: no data on meat harvest; 55 kg caviar <br/>Iowa: 34,603 kg meat; 55 kg caviar <br/>Kentucky: no data on meat harvest; 88 kg caviar <br/>Missouri: 26,460 kg meat; 66–88 kg caviar <br/>Wisconsin: 11,025 kg meat; 33 kg caviar","In 2001, all of the states within the current and historic range of the shovelnose sturgeon were surveyed by the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association (MICRA) to determine the shovelnose sturgeon status. Ten of the range states responded with sufficient information to allow the author to place the individual states into one of four classifications: (1) extirpated, (2) rare/vulnerable/imperiled, (3) stable and (4) undetermined. The remaining range states were assigned these classifications based on information provided by the Nature Conservancy at their website: <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer"">http://www.natureserve.org/explore</a>. The species has been extirpated from five states, is rare to imperiled in four states, stable in 10 states and has undetermined status in five states.
<br/>
<br/>Historically, shovelnose were apparently common in the Tennessee River system, all the way to the French Broad River on the Tennessee-North Carolina border before the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reservoir system was constructed (Etnier and Starnes 1993). These authors note that, while the species may still occur there sporadically, no recent records exist for either the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers. Sprague (1960) documented the decline in catch and condition of the shovelnose over a five-year period in the Missouri River after impoundment of Lewis and Clark Lake. However, since then these subpopulations have apparently recovered and stabilized (Hesse and Carreiro 1997). Trautman (1981) stated that the shovelnose was considered abundant in the Ohio River until 1911 when the river began ""ponding"" as a result of construction of the slackwater navigation project, thereby partially stopping the spawning run. After that, Trautman (1981) said fishermen reported a drastic decrease in shovelnose sturgeon abundance.  Mettee, <em>et al</em>. (1996) considered the shovelnose extirpated in Alabama.
<br/>
<br/>Today, the shovelnose sturgeon still occurs in most of the large tributaries of the Upper Mississippi River from Wisconsin to Illinois. Hesse and Carreiro (1997) listed 59 rivers, creeks, oxbows and bayous in the Mississippi River Basin where shovelnose sturgeon occurred historically, but only 44 of these were listed as supporting the species today. In Illinois, the species is most abundant in the Wabash River, a tributary to the Ohio River (Smith 1979). According to Smith (1979) the Wabash is less impacted by flood-control dams and other modifications than are the remainder of Illinois’ large rivers.
<br/>
<br/>In the mainstem Mississippi River, numbers of shovelnose sturgeon have decreased sharply since 1900 (Becker 1983), although the species is still commonly taken by commercial fishermen (UMRCC Annual Reports; Etnier and Starnes 1993. Several authors have noted a lack of natural reproduction in areas of the Missouri and have attributed it to man-made alterations to shovelnose sturgeon habitat (Bailey and Cross 1954, June 1977, Moos 1978).   Meanwhile, upstream from the Missouri River mainstem impoundments shovelnose sturgeon remain abundant in the river below Great Falls, Montana and in the major tributaries (Montana DNRC 1977). Robison and Buchanan (1988) describe the shovelnose as especially abundant in the unimpounded portions of the Arkansas, lower White and Red rivers in Arkansas. According to Hesse and Carreiro (1997) state biologists attribute the success of White River sturgeon to a somewhat natural hydrograph with seasonal floods, good gravel bars, and backwater complexes.
<br/>
<br/>Hesse and Carreiro (1997) concluded that while shovelnose sturgeon have probably been considered less at risk than other sturgeon species, evidence suggests that deterioration of the shovelnose’s overall range is keeping pace with that of the other sturgeon species.
<br/>
<br/>Obrecht (1996) noted that shovelnose have been reintroduced into the Bighorn River Basin in Wyoming, where they had been extirpated by dams which blocked spawning migrations from downstream in Montana. West Virginia and New Mexico have also developed reintroduction plans for rivers where the shovelnose has been extirpated (Keenlyne 1997). The Ohio Division of Wildlife reports a plan to reintroduce the shovelnose sturgeon in the Ohio River above Meldahl Lock and Dam at Ohio River kilometer 702 (Scott Schell, pers. comm.). The species has not been recorded from the middle Rio Grande in New Mexico since 1875 (NMDGF 1991).",Decreasing,"The species occurs throughout much of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and portions of their largest tributaries (Lee 1978), including the lower Ohio River (Smith 1979). The species once occurred as far upstream in the Ohio River as Pennsylvania (Trautman 1981). Shovelnose sturgeon are rare above Newburg, Indiana (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 1990), but relatively abundant below Smithland Locks and Dam at Ohio River kilometer 1,479 (Greg Conover, USFWs, pers. comm.). The <em>Scaphirhynchus</em> species, previously reported as shovelnose sturgeon in the drainages of Mobile Bay in Alabama by Smith-Vaniz (1968), were reclassified by Williams and Clemmer (1991) as the Alabama sturgeon (<em>Scaphirhynchus suttkusi</em>). The only known subpopulation of shovelnose sturgeon in the Alabama portion of the Tennessee River is apparently extinct. Shovelnose sturgeon may still occur sporadically in the lower Tennessee or Cumberland Rivers (Etnier and Starnes 1993).

Highly-effective fishing gear, including modified longlines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. ocellatus</span> are unknown it has been suggested that populations are declining due in part to over-fishing. It is likely that spawning aggregations of this species, which are found in freshwater, are intrinsically vulnerable to over-exploitation.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations<br/></span> Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Takifugu</span> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and overfishing</span><br/> Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/> This species is anadromous and breeds in freshwater. Several of its known breeding and feeding grounds, including the estuaries of the lower Yangtze river and several downstream lakes have recorded declines in fish biodiversity and shifts in species composition which have been attributed to anthropogenic habitat alteration, river modification (i.e. dam construction), overfishing, heavy metal pollution, deforestation and land erosion (Fu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Zhang<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008, Huang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Chen and Zhu 2008).

This species is also found in the ornamental aquarium trade.<em> Takifugu ocellatus</em>, like other fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K.

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations, which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009).&#160;<strong></strong></p>  <br/><br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. ocellatus</em>,&#160;however, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. ocellatus</em>. Additionally,<em> T. ocellatus&#160;</em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p>      <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> can be found in both&#160; freshwater and marine  protected areas. According to the protection regulations for wetlands in  the Poyang Lake of Jiangxi Province (2004) and the implementation of  Chinese Fishery Lawin Jiangxi Province (1987), fishing is is banned from  March 20th to June 20th every year in Poyang Lake. This corresponds  with the spawning migration of this species in China, although whether  or not this species spawns in the lake is unknown. Fishing has  also been banned for two months from June 1st to July 31st each year  since 1987 along the Xiajiang reach, Xingan reach, Jishui reach and Jian  reach of the Ganjiang River, where this species has been recorded; &#160;however, this does not correspond to the freshwater spawning migration  of this species (Huang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010).<br/>       </p><p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Overall population trend is unknown, but is subject to extreme fluctuations and reductions during El Niño events (10–90% mortality), which are predicted to intensify in the future with ongoing climate change.<br/><br/>Marine Iguana populations have been reduced by invasive alien predators such as feral cats, rats, and free-roaming pigs and dogs on five of the 13 main islands (<em>ca</em>&#160;30% of the total population). These iguanas are threatened by a region-wide increase in human population and visitation that has multiplied the impacts from stress, marine pollution including oil and diesel spills, habitat degradation, and chance of further invasive species introductions and emergent diseases. Land-based tourist presence and intensity has been shown to have a significant overall negative effect on iguana health. Overall population trends are difficult to estimate without comprehensive population size monitoring data, however, the multitude of known anthropogenic threats found across the archipelago are sufficient to support an estimate of an overall population reduction of at least 30% over the last three generations. Without significant invasive species control and enhanced protection from marine pollution, declines are projected to continue in the near future, exacerbated by increasingly frequent and severe El Niño events and human impacts that affect all populations. We estimate that the per cent reduction over the past two generations and one generation into the future (<em>ca</em> 18–24 years) will also be at least 30%. This species qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","Marine Iguanas are the only lizard species that forage in the ocean. Adults and juveniles occur on rocky coasts and intertidal zones. Adult females can be found nesting up to 2 km inland and adult males can be found foraging in marine waters, up to depths of 30 m. They feed almost exclusively on marine algae, primarily three red genera (<em>Centroceras</em>, <em>Gelidium</em>, <em>Pterocladia</em>; Rubenstein and Wikelski 2003) and the green algal genus <em>Ulva</em> when exposed during low tides (Shepherd and Hawkes 2005). The majority of iguanas graze intertidally, though the largest iguanas of each colony also dive beneath the sea surface to forage on offshore algal beds (30 m offshore, 2–30 m depth; Buttemer and Dawson 1993, Wikelski and Trillmich 1994). Some iguana populations have been known to supplement their algal diet with highly salty land plants, primarily Saltwort (<em>Batis maritima</em>), but also other coastal succulents such as <em>Sesuvium portulacastrum</em> (Wikelski and Wrege 2000).<br/><br/>Marine Iguanas exhibit high morphological diversity, including substantial body size and shape variation among populations and sexes (Chiari <em>et al</em>. 2016). Males are larger, with different head morphology than females and more pronounced spines on the head and along the back. Average body size (snout-to-vent length) is 260 mm (range 120–490 mm; Miralles <em>et al</em>. 2017). Adult males weigh approximately 70% more than adult females (Laurie and Brown 1990a). Differences in maximum body size across islands is likely due to variability in algal productivity and sea surface temperature between islands (Wikelski and Trillmich 1997, Wikelski and Romero 2003, Wikelski 2005).<br/><br/>Reproduction occurs once a year during a month-long mating season, coinciding with the highest abundance and best nutritional quality of food (Rubenstein and Wikelski 2003). Nutrient-rich upwellings from the Humboldt and Cromwell currents affect all islands differently, so mating occurs at different times across the archipelago, varying somewhat from year to year. During this time males tend to become more colourful.<br/><br/>Marine Iguanas are the only lizard known to use a lek mating system, in which dominant males defend small territories (without resources beyond themselves) from other males. Male mating success is highly skewed to a few individuals and depends on body size, condition, and head-bob courtship behaviour. A single territorial male may be responsible for 35% of copulations on a lek (Trillmich 1983; Wikelski <em>et al</em>. 1996, 2001). Non-territorial males roam the periphery and try to force copulations with females, although they are rarely successful (Wikelski and Bäurle 1996). “Sneaker” males (physically small and resembling females) occupy the territories and also try to force copulations with females, which is also almost never successful.<br/><br/>Around four weeks after mating, females seek out and defend suitable sandy areas for digging burrows (Rauch 1988). Females lay 1–6 eggs (most commonly 2–3), which is highly dependent on female body condition and food availability (see subspecies <em>cristatus</em>, <em>hassi</em>, and <em>trillmichi</em> for additional data). Eggs are left to incubate for three months (Laurie 1990; Laurie and Brown 1990a, 1990b). Individual female iguanas typically reproduce once every two years (Vitousek 2009), or annually during periods of high food abundance (Laurie 1990). Hatchlings emerge at a body mass of <em>ca</em> 50 g (Trillmich and Trillmich 1986).","Marine Iguanas are threatened by extreme fluctuations in population size caused by periodic El Niño events (30–50% average mortality in the region, and up to 90% are known). Deaths are due to starvation following a rapid temperature-driven change in the algal community (Wikelski <em>et a</em>l. 1996). During El Niño events, warm water from the Gulf of Panama flows toward the Galápagos and the nutrient upwelling is suppressed, which results in the proliferation of brown algae (e.g., <em>Giffordia mitchelliae</em>) that is not easily digestible by iguanas and may be toxic. The largest animals of each subpopulation starve first (Wikelski and Trillmich 1997, Wikelski <em>et al</em>. 1997, Wikelski 2005) followed by smaller individuals during these periods. Food shortages during El Niño events can lead to the unusual phenomenon of shrinking in body length within just a few months (Wikelski and Thom 2000), apparently facilitated by absorption of their own bone matter. Predictions that climate change may increase the severity and frequency of El Niño events (Timmermann <em>et al</em>. 1999, Cai <em>et al</em>. 2014) suggest that some subpopulations could be removed entirely.<br/><br/>On several large islands (Isabela, Santiago, Santa Cruz and Baltra, Floreana, San Cristóbal) and satellite cays, there is an ongoing significant threat to Marine Iguanas from invasive alien predators, particularly cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) and rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>, <em>R. norwegicus</em>), as well as free-roaming domestic dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>, Kruuk and Snell 1981) and pigs (<em>Sus domesticus;</em>&#160;Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). For several decades, the presence of cats has been associated with a lack of hatchling and juvenile Marine Iguanas (Laurie 1983, Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994, MacLeod and Steinfartz 2016). Predation has also been directly confirmed at several locations on Isabela and Santa Cruz (Laurie 1983, Konecny 1983). The survival of hatchlings in colonies affected by predators is alarmingly low: 1% at a cat-affected colony on Santa Cruz compared to 53% at an unaffected colony on Santa Fe (Laurie 1983). Rats likely pose the most significant threat to young Marine Iguanas on islands where other food sources for the rats are scarce as on the small cays (e.g., Pinzón, Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994). The total adult population of iguanas on affected islands is estimated at&#160;<em>ca</em> 7,100–57,000 which constitutes <em>ca</em> 20 and 30% of the total adult iguana population.<br/><br/>The Galápagos has seen a dramatic recent increase in both tourists and residents living on the islands and adversely affecting the ecosystem. Approximately 25,000 people live among five islands (Toral-Granda <em>et al</em>. 2017), though this figure likely does not include illegal residents seeking work in the tourism industry. The total number of tourists arriving in Galápagos each year has also increased from 11,765 in 1979 to 224,755 tourists in 2015, a 19-fold increase. Between 2000 and 2015, average annual tourism growth was 8.2% and the number of sites visited has increased to 169. The nature of tourism has also changed, from being historically boat-based, to now being significantly land-based (on the inhabited islands) (Toral-Granda <em>et al</em>. 2017). Tourist presence and intensity has been shown to have a significant overall negative effect on immunological capability, endocrine response, and oxidative stress in Marine Iguanas (French <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2017).<br/><br/>Cargo ship traffic has risen to supply the larger resident and tourist population, and this has brought an increase in various types of pollution, habitat degradation, and an increased chance of invasive terrestrial species introductions and emergent mosquito-borne diseases. Additionally, the potential for aquatic invaders on ship hulls and in ballast water may pose a threat to the Marine Iguanas’ food supply (Toral-Granda <em>et al</em>. 2017). An unusual mortality (62% loss) on Santa Fé was recorded in 2001 following a diesel and oil spill from a tanker that ran aground near the island of San Cristóbal (Wikelski <em>et al</em>. 2002). Other subpopulations may have well been affected, but this was not recorded due to lack of long-term monitoring for most islands. Notable is that just trace amounts of oil around Santa Fé caused this mortality, indicating the extreme sensitivity of Marine Iguanas to such pollution. It is thought that the symbiotic bacteria within the gut of the iguanas that are essential for proper digestion (Mackie <em>et al</em>. 2004) were negatively affected/removed by this exposure, resulting in the iguanas being unable to digest their food. Several other diesel and oil spills have occurred since 2001 on Santa Cruz and San Cristóbal.<br/><br/>On islands with permanent human settlements (Santa Cruz, San Cristóbal, Isabela, and Floreana), municipal waste incineration of organic waste and plastics in open dump areas is a potential source of unintentionally), municipal waste incineration of organic waste and plastics in open dump areas is a potential source of unintentionally-produced persistent organic pollutants such as dioxins and furans. Over 50% of the currently used pesticides applied in the agriculture zone were identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, underscoring potential health effects in the endemic fauna (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2014). Widespread marine plastic debris and micro-plastic pollution may be an emerging threat to Marine Iguanas and their food source.","Only very rough estimates of population size are available for the entire population of Marine Iguanas. They are noted to be as low as 33,000 total individuals after a strong El Niño famine and as many as 350,000 after several years of La Niña abundant food conditions (Wikelski and Nelson 2004). Little is known regarding current mature adult numbers, but it is estimated to be under 210,000 based on calculations indicating that 60% of the maximum total population are adults (Laurie 1983, Laurie and Brown 1990a, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Average generation length is five years for females and 12 years for males (6–8 years is used for calculations). Approximately 20–30% of the total population (<em>ca</em> 10,000–73,000) is estimated to be declining due to the continual impacts of invasive alien predators. Sharp declines relating to these threats have been reported since the early 1980s (Laurie 1983, Jacome 1989, Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994, Wikelski and Nelson 2004, MacLeod and Steinfartz 2016); covering a period of well over three generations. A severe absence of younger iguanas in some colonies has been observed, most notably on Floreana, Isabela, Santa Cruz, and San Cristóbal (Laurie 1983).<br/><br/>Recent genetic analysis indicates that the subpopulations (subspecies) show a variable effective population size, from critically low (<em>A. c. godzilla</em>) to healthy (<em>A. c. cristatus</em>) (range: 37–2,388; MacLeod and Steinfartz 2016). Subspecies with very low values may show consequences of inbreeding and have reduced ability to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions (N<sub>e</sub> &gt; 1,000 minimum; Frankham <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Populations undergo extreme fluctuations by cyclic, but unpredictably recurring, famine (El Niño) and feast (La Niña) events. El Niño events dramatically reduce the abundance, diversity, and nutritional value of available marine algae, as the iguanas are unable to digest the algae that grows during these periods (Trillmich and Trillmich 1986). Population declines are strongly density-dependent: the higher the population density, the higher the mortalities during El Niños (from 10–90%). Population recovery after El Niños can be rapid if food resources are available again, as individuals grow faster, reproduce more frequently and lay more eggs (Laurie and Brown 1990a).<br/><br/>The lack of population size monitoring data presents a challenge when assessing the overall population trajectory. However, surveys in the 1980s noted that the species was in danger of extirpation on several islands (Laurie 1983) and subsequent work noted a further decline (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994). In 2002, the number of iguanas on San Cristóbal, Santa Cruz, and Santiago was noted to be significantly less than expected (Snell and Márquez 2002). Indeed, the multitude of known and predicted future anthropogenic threats found across the archipelago are sufficient to support a finding of an overall population reduction of at least 30% over the last four decades. Without significant invasive species control and enhanced protection from marine pollution, declines are projected to increase in the future, exacerbated by increasingly frequent and severe El Niño events that affect all populations.",Decreasing,"The Marine Iguana occurs on the large islands of Española, Fernandina, Floreana, Genovesa, Isabela, Marchena, Pinta, San Cristobál, Santa Cruz, Santa Fé, and Santiago, the mid-sized islands of Baltra, Bartolomé, Pinzón, Plaza Norte, Plaza Sur, Rábida, and Seymour Norte, smaller key populations on Darwin, Roca Redonda, and Wolf, as well as many satellite islets of the Galápagos Archipelago, Ecuador. This species has an extent of occurrence of 56,647 km<sup>2</sup> by minimum convex polygon enclosing all subpopulations, that includes the far distant small islands of Darwin and Wolf. A minimum convex polygon enclosing just the central islands (without Darwin and Wolf) of occurrence is 42,155 km<sup>2</sup>. Marine Iguanas are found within 2 km of the coast with a total area of occupancy of 4,368 km<sup>2</sup>, using a 2x2 km grid overlay in this coastal zone. They are found near (&lt; 200 m asl) and below sea level at depths up to 30 m (large adult males).","This species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Wildlife trafficking is the third most profitable illegal activity in the world, and although Ecuador has never declared export of live specimens of <em>Amblyrhynchus cristatus</em> for commercial trade (CITES trade data, UNEP-WCMC 2018), they are known to exist in the pet trade. Four smuggling cases with prosecutions occurred between 2010 and 2015 (Auliya <em>et al</em>. 2016). While not significantly reducing the population currently, their entry into the pet trade is of concern.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The entire Marine Iguana distribution is included in three protected areas: Galápagos National Park and National Marine Reserve, Galápagos Islands Man and Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO), and Galápagos Islands World Heritage Site. Because the Galápagos is a high tourism area, it has attracted large numbers of migrants from the Ecuadorian mainland seeking tourist industry jobs. To curb population increase, Ecuador enacted a new law (Ley Orgánica de Régimen Especial para la Conservación y Desarrollo Sustentable de la Provincia de Galápagos: LOREG) requiring a special visa to visit the Galápagos, and there are strict limits on who can move there permanently (Strahm and Patry 2010).<br/><br/>Several eradication programmes have occurred in the Galápagos, including feral goats from several islands, cats from Baltra and Venecia, and Black Rats from Seymour Norte and Bainbridge #4 (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). Increased efforts to eradicate or control cats, dogs, rats, and pigs to benefit all subpopulations of Marine Iguanas is sorely needed. The impact of rats is less well understood, however, it was documented that more hatchlings than normal were observed following a nearly complete eradication of Black Rats from Pinzón in 1988 (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Conservation and research actions recommended for the species include an improved knowledge of population size, trends, distribution, factors limiting population size, habitat trends, and invasive species management. Some populations are of particular conservation concern and further research on the impact of low effective population size is recommended. Research to understand the impact of warming waters (climate change and El Niño) on individual algae species, along with other factors affecting algae community composition and iguana foraging dynamics, is recommended (Shepherd and Hawks 2005, Vinueza <em>et al</em>. 2006, Tomkins and Wolff 2017). An increased understanding of the effect of widespread oceanic pollution, including oil spills and micro-plastics, on Marine Iguanas and their micro-biota (which enable effective digestion) is also needed. Plastic debris ranks as one of the most abundant and persistent solid wastes at sea and shorelines, representing 25% of the total marine debris collected during beach cleanups in the Galápagos (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2014). Improved biosecurity measures to prevent disease introductions, such as West Nile Virus, avian malaria, and other are also recommended. Ongoing monitoring for introduced pathogens in Galápagos reptiles and other fauna is needed (Bataille <em>et al</em>. 2009; Eastwood <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2014).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It is known from one threat-defined location; its population may be severely fragmented; there is a continuing decline in the quality of its habitat at the most important known site; and also a likely ongoing decline in the number of mature individuals due to heavy predation pressure by the waterbird population in the Hula Valley area. The largest known subpopulation consists of fewer than 250 mature individuals and this may represent the majority of the surviving population; consequently this species may be close to, or may qualify for, listing under criterion C1. The effective population size is considerably lower, and potentially below 50 individuals.","Observations related to the rediscovery suggest that this species may be more terrestrial than initially thought (S. Gafny pers. comm. March 2012). Adults are mainly nocturnal and burrow into ""moist detritus"" (Renan <em>et al.</em> 2017), although adults remain around and can be found in the water during the presumed February-September breeding season (Perl <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, 2018). Perl <em>et al. </em>(2017) found adults in the Hula Nature Reserve only in areas of peaty soil beneath deep (20-30 cm) leaf litter in areas of dense vegetation. Renan&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2017) conducted habitat suitability modelling based on presence-absence surveys using environmental DNA. Their results suggested that the species is concentrated in southern and western areas of the Hula Valley whose original (pre-1950s) habitat was lake or swamp (and which retains dense vegetation cover which may provide important movement corridors during the breeding season). Extant subpopulations appear to be associated with reservoirs and waterbodies in arable land and orchards on organic and colluvial-alluvial soils (Renan <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sites with positive detections ranged from small ponds to large pools and included both lotic and lentic waterbodies (Renan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017), although it is unclear whether rain pools are significant for reproduction as it appears to be associated with permanent water sources (Perl&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The Yesod HaMa'ala ditch is supplied by a permanent spring and characterized by dense vegetation both within and around the water (Perl&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).<br/><br/>It is a larval-developing species, and its advertisement call is described by Perl <em>et al</em>. (2017). Recent records of very small juveniles and the difficulty of detecting tadpoles suggest that this species may have a short larval period (Renan <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>On average, females of this species can be 6.9-12.4 cm in size, and males 6.66-12.84 cm (Perl&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017)<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>","The Huleh marshes were drained in the 1950s in an attempt to both eradicate malaria and to make the land suitable for agricultural use. Of the original 6,000 ha of marshland, only 300 ha (3 km²<sup></sup>) remained after drainage. The remaining wetland was set aside as a nature reserve - the Hula Nature Reserve - in 1964. While the reserve is well-managed, it functions as a refuge for many water birds, possibly more than used to be in the original swamp, and predation pressure is thought to be very high and a real threat to a small amphibian population comprised of few individuals (S. Gafny pers. comm. March 2012). This appears to be supported by high rates of injury recorded among adults in Yesod HaMa'ala, and may reflect predation attempts by both native species and invasive species such as mosquitofish (Perl <em>et al. </em>2017). In addition, most of the area surrounding the reserve is cultivated (S. Gafny pers. comm. March 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The majority of the known extant population appears to occur in Yesod HaMa'ala, an unprotected locality which is subject to varied threats including pollution (pesticide pollution, petrol spills, and high levels of plastic and metal waste - Perl <em>et al. </em>2017), habitat alteration and desiccation (S. Gafny pers. comm. 2020), and the species remains ""one of the most endangered vertebrates on earth"" (Renan <em>et al</em>. 2017). The species' apparent survival throughout the former area of the Hula swamp suggests that it may exhibit some resilience to high levels of habitat modification so long as breeding sites survive, although likely at reduced densities (Renan <em>et al. </em>2017). It is likely that these remnant subpopulations survive in suboptimal habitat, increasing the risk of recruitment failure (Renan<em> et al</em>. 2017). The species appears to be closely tied to waterbodies and to remain close to water year-round, limiting its dispersal capabilities and increasing its sensitivity to highly localized environmental changes that impact these sites (Perl <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Samples of this species have tested positive for the amphibian chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, but no signs of chytridiomycosis have been detected and the species appears to exhibit some innate immunity (Perl <em>et al.</em> 2017).","Prior to this frog's rediscovery in 2011 (Rinat 2011), it had not been recorded since 1955 and was the first amphibian species to be listed as Extinct on the IUCN Red List. Surveys of potentially suitable habitat had been undertaken, including in the Aammiq marsh (the only remaining  wetland fragment of the Bekaa valley) of nearby  southeast Lebanon, but these failed to locate any  animals there (Tron and Duguet 2004, Tron 2005). Until its rediscovery, only three adult specimens and two tadpoles were known to science (S. Gafny pers. comm. March 2012).&#160;The species has proven to be difficult to detect using traditional observation and acoustic survey methods, and only 34 individuals were recorded prior to the study conducted by Renan<em> et al.</em> (2017).&#160;Most recent specimens have been taken from the unprotected subpopulation in Yesod HaMa'ala, which has an estimated total population size of 233-244 potentially breeding adults (which may be an overestimate) but an effective population size of only 16.5-35.8 individuals (based on mark-recapture data from 118 sampled adults - Peri<em> et al</em>. 2018). There is very little information on the status of the Hula Nature Reserve subpopulation (S. Gafny pers. comm. 2020). The study conducted by Renan <em>et al. </em>(2017) recorded a ""small reduction"" in positive site detections between spring 2015 and spring 2016; this corresponded to observed reductions in tadpole numbers in other amphibian species and may reflect a bad breeding year. This species exhibits low dispersal capabilities (marked individuals all travelled no more than 100 m, and most less than 10 m over an 18 day period - Perl <em>et al</em>. 2017) and is unlikely to disperse through modified terrestrial habitats outside the nature reserve (Perl<em> et al.</em> 2018). These authors hypothesize that the high genetic diversity they record reflects either 'genetic rescue' during sporadic flooding events, or the concentration of historically genetically distinct subpopulations within remnant habitat following land conversion. They further hypothesize that continued admixture between these genetic clusters may reflect low levels of recruitment. The population of this species may consequently be severely fragmented.",Decreasing,"In the 1940s this species was recorded from only two sites on the eastern shore of Lake Huleh, Israel. In 1955 the species was recorded again, in the northwest edge of the Hula swamps, just east of the extant 'En Agmon spring (Y. Werner pers. comm. March 2012), following partial reflooding of the valley (Perl <em>et al.</em> 2017). It was rediscovered in 2011 at 65 asl at a locality in the Hula Nature Reserve less than 5 km away from its former sites.&#160;<br/><br/>As of 2020, extant subpopulations were known only from two localities: the Hula Nature Reserve site (Perl&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017); and a site within a ditch (1.5 m wide and 600 m long) in the vicinity of Yesod HaMa'ala village detected in December 2013 (unmapped; Perl <em>et al.</em> 2017). This site is less than 2 km from the extant Hula Nature Reserve locality (S. Gafny pers. comm. 2020). The known global range covers an area of less than 6.5 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and surveys in the surrounding area suggest the species is genuinely endemic to the area of the former Hula swamps, but it is unknown how many active reproductive sites exist within this area (Perl<em> et al. </em>2017). This area is treated as a single threat-defined location.<br/><br/>An environmental DNA study reported evidence of this species' DNA in 18 additional waterbodies within Hula Nature Reserve and two adjacent reserves (Agamon Ha-Hula nature park and Ein Te'o nature reserve), but extensive surveys have not recorded specimens in any of these (S. Gafny pers. comm. 2020) and the eDNA results suggest that extant subpopulations are confined to a very restricted area in the south of the Hula Valley (Renan <em>et al</em>. 2017).

Lake ecosystems in the area are being affected negatively by the introduction of exotic fish such as <em>Basilicthys bonariensis </em>and&#160;<em>Oncorhynchus&#160;mykiss</em> (J. Fjeldså <em>in litt. </em>2003,&#160;<strong></strong>Martinez <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Uro communities have recently started hunting birds, including Titicaca Grebes, on a commercial basis to sell at market<strong> </strong>(Martinez <em>et al. </em>2006), and eggs may be harvested for food. Harvesting of <em>tule-</em>beds has taken place for centuries but human population growth and market demand for cattle may be changing harvesting patterns and posing a threat to the grebes' breeding habitat<strong> </strong>(Martinez <em>et al. </em>2006). In particular, burning of <em>tule</em>-rushes during the grebes' peak breeding period may be affecting reproduction<strong> </strong>(B.<strong> </strong>Hennessey <em>in litt.</em> 2005). Tourism on Lake Titicaca has increased rapidly over the past decade, and disturbance by boats may be a threat to reproductive success<strong> </strong>(H. Aranibar-Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007). Alteration of the rio Desaguadero watercourse for extensive farming may affect the aquatic ecosystems of Lakes Poopó and Uru Uru in the future<strong> </strong>(H. Aranibar-Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007). Organic and inorganic waste from cities such as Alto is dumped in large quantities in some parts of Lake Titicaca<strong> </strong>(H. Aranibar-Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007). <p></p>","Based on counts on Lake Titicaca in 2003 (Martinez <em>et al</em>. 2006) and adults counted elsewhere in the Titicaca watershed (Engblom <em>et al</em>. 2001), the population was estimated at around 1,600 mature individuals. On Lake Titicaca itself, 2,583 individuals of all ages were counted; combined with smaller numbers elsewhere in the watershed, this represents a higher population than previously assumed. In 2007, 1,254 individuals were counted in the wet season (H. Aranibar-Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007). The species is however thought to decline at 50-60% over three generations; thus the population may number c. 600 mature individuals in 2020. To account for uncertainty, the population size is here placed in the band 250-999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Rollandia microptera</em> is endemic to open, freshwater lakes on the altiplano of <strong>Peru</strong> and <strong>Bolivia</strong>. It occurs from lakes Arapa and Umayo in south-eastern Peru, through Lake Titicaca into adjacent Bolivia, and along the Desaguadero River to Lakes Uru-uru and Poopó (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997).

178756918,178756893,Berardius minimus,Near Threatened,A4b,2020,2020-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>There is no information on global abundance or population trends for this species. It is known from six stranded or drifting specimens off Hokkaido, Japan; one from Kunashir Island and two from Sakhalin Island, Russia; and two from Unalaska Island (eastern Aleutian Islands) and a few from the Alaska Peninsula, USA (Morin <em>et al.</em> 2017, Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Fedutin <em>et al. </em>2020). Because this species is easily confused with Baird’s Beaked Whale in the wild, it could either be rare or uncommon (see Supplementary Information for definitions), though the paucity of strandings makes being rare more likely. The distribution is limited to cold-temperate waters of the North Pacific west of the Gulf of Alaska. Anthropogenic threats have been identified, including direct hunting and bycatch.<br/><br/>Sato’s Beaked Whale<em> </em>was not assessed previously as it was only described as a new species in August 2019. The Red List Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) state that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” However, LC is not plausible because the species is likely rare and has a relatively small distribution such that demographically independent populations that could buffer risk cannot be assured and with known threats in a substantial portion of that distribution (see the Supplementary Information). Small numbers of human-caused deaths can result in declines in cetaceans given their low maximum growth rates. Given that the advice in the Guidelines is to be precautionary, Least Concern is not an option. Data on the distribution of Sato’s Beaked Whale come primarily from strandings, and densities across the species’ known range are unknown. Well-documented threats, including direct hunting and bycatch, may be present in more than half of the total distribution, if the western portion of the range contains more than half of the total population of Sato’s Beaked Whale. Should that be the case, the most plausible categories would be CR and EN. However, the converse is also true; that is, if the western portion of the range contains less than half of the total population, then the risk to the species is less and the plausible categories range from EN to NT (see the Supplementary Information for further explanation) under criterion A4b. Overall, plausible categories range from CR to NT. Given the large uncertainties about this newly named species, the category Near Threatened, which applies to taxa that do not qualify as threatened now, but may be close to qualifying for at least Vulnerable, is the most appropriate.</p>","Almost nothing is known about habitats and ecology of Sato’s Beaked Whale but these are assumed to be similar to Baird's Beaked Whale, with primary habitat on or near the continental slope and on or near oceanic seamounts in cold-temperate waters. Like Baird's Beaked Whales, Sato’s Beaked Whales probably feed mainly on deepwater and bottom-dwelling gadiform fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2009).","<p>Little specific information is available on anthropogenic threats to Sato’s Beaked Whale (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019). </p>  <p>Although there has never been a directed hunt for Sato’s Beaked Whales, they could well be taken at least occasionally in the directed hunt for Baird’s Beaked Whales in the Okhotsk Sea off northern Hokkaido, Japan (Kasuya 2017).&#160; One unidentified <em>Berardius</em> assumed to have been a Sato’s Beaked Whale was killed incidentally in fishing gear off Shibetsu, Hokkaido in July 2004 (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Fig. 1). Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and beaked whales are known to become entangled and drown in such gear (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009). The extent of this threat to Sato’s Beaked Whales is unknown.</p>  <p>There is increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as those from active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar by military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact causes of such strandings are often not clear, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). There is one documented mass stranding of Baird’s Beaked Whales in Japan and two in Mexico.</p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Macroplastic items can block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Subramanian et al. (1988) reported relatively low values of PCBs and DDE in Baird’s Beaked Whales. Organochlorine and halogenated dimethylbipyrrole residues have been identified in the tissues of Baird’s Beaked Whales (Prudente <em>et al</em>. 1997, Haraguchi <em>et al</em>. 2006) and various mesoplodonts (Kajiwara<em> et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, no Sato’s Beaked Whales have been examined for pollutants. Therefore, any potential health hazard from exposure to chemical pollutants is unknown.</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>Although none of the above factors, when considered in isolation, appears to represent an immediate threat to this species, the cumulative effects could be unsustainable for what is likely a rare, or at least uncommon, species.</p>","There is no abundance or trend information for this species. The only abundance estimate for “Baird’s Beaked Whales” (including the new species) within the range of Sato’s Beaked Whale is 663 from the southern Okhotsk Sea in the 1980s (Miyashita 1990). However, Sato’s Beaked Whale is probably rare, given the small number of confirmed strandings.",Decreasing,"<p>Sato’s Beaked Whales are known from the cold-temperate western and central North Pacific (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Morin <em>et al</em>. 2017, Fedutin <em>et al. </em>2020). There are four records based on skull characteristics from northern Hokkaido, Japan; two from Sakhalin Island and one from Kunashir Island, Russia; and two from Unalaska Island, and a few from the Alaska Peninsula, Alaska, USA (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Morin <em>et al</em>. 2017, Fedutin <em>et al. </em>2020). There are six confirmed genetic samples from Japan and this includes the four specimens based on skull characters (Yamada et al 2019). Morin <em>et al</em>. (2017) examined 178 genetic samples of <em>Berardius</em> sp. from throughout their North Pacific range from Japan to the southern Gulf of California, Mexico and five of these proved to be <em>B. minimus</em> from the eastern Aleutian Islands and the Bering Sea. Fedutin <em>et al. </em>(2020) reported on the genetic analysis of 28 specimens of <em>Berardius</em> from Russia and three from Sakhalin and Kunashir Islands were <em>B. minimus</em>. Overall, Sato’s Beaked Whale appears to have a limited distribution when compared to Baird’s Beaked Whale, between 40°N and 60°N and 140°E and 160°W (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Morin <em>et al</em>. 2017).

Although the true area of occupancy is probably larger as additional localities may exist, the calculated value encompasses known sites throughout the distribution. It is unlikely to be substantially more widespread within this area and the true AOO is certainly below 500 km<sup>2</sup>.","It is semi-fossorial, inhabiting lowland sandy and clay soils (de Pous<em> et al. </em>2012, Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2013) in the vicinity of open cork woodlands, shrubland, delatic wetlands and cultivated lands (Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2019). Although it can sometimes be found in areas with little tree cover (including open forests modified by grazing - Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2013, Sánchez-Vialas<em> et al.</em> 2017) and there are individual records from sites on other soils (de Pous<em> et al.</em> 2012, Sánchez-Vialas <em>et al</em>. 2017) or surrounded by agricultural land (Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2013, Sánchez-Vialas&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017) it favours woodland or forest (Sánchez-Vialas <em>et al</em>. 2017). Adults are mainly nocturnal and remain dormant during the dry season, between May-June and October (Pasteur and Bons 1959; Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The spawning sites are mostly temporary waterbodies (known locally as dayas). Breeding sites are typically deep and with extended (4-8 months - Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2017) hydroperiods (Hinckley<em> et al.</em> 2016, Sánchez-Vialas&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017), but it has been found in ponds whose depth in the rainy season is as shallow as 40 cm (Sánchez-Vialas<em> et al. </em>2017).&#160;The reproductive period begins with the first rains in late autumn and/or early winter (Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2013). The larvae are omnivores and consume a wide range of small invertebrates, particularly small branchiopods (Escoriza <em>et al.</em> 2016). They are frequent prey of small ardeids, storks and aquatic snakes.&#160;<br/><br/>Many of the known localities are in areas surrounded or heavily impacted by pasture, arable or plantation agriculture (Hinckley <em>et al. </em>2016). This species, and invasive fish (Mosquitofish&#160;<em>Gambusia holbrooki</em>&#160;and Pumpkinseed&#160;<em>Lepomis gibbosus&#160;</em>- Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2019), have been recorded in otherwise good quality ponds (Hinckley<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016). Larvae have been found in ponds where invasive crayfish are present, although at lower densities than in nearby ponds without invasive species, but not where Mosquitofish are established (Hinckley<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). Observations in late 2015 confirmed that the crayfish is expanding its range into areas where spadefoot toads occur, and it is possible the toad can only survive in invaded ponds where crayfish are recent colonizers (Hinckley<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2016).","The major threats include habitat loss and degradation due to the conversion of land to intensive agriculture and urbanization.&#160;All extant subpopulations of the species are concentrated in the northern Atlantic plain of Morocco, a region undergoing significant urban expansion and where hardly any refuges with natural vegetation remain. In total, over a third of the species' occupied sites are estimated to have been ""severely altered"" since the beginning of the 21st Century, based on annual surveys since 1994 (D. Donaire-Barroso pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat suitability modelling (based on measures of annual precipitation, diurnal period and mean annual temperature) under four different climate change scenarios suggests that this species is likely to benefit from climatic changes projected to occur by 2050, with habitat suitability increases between 11 and 71% projected (Rodríguez-Rodríguez <em>e</em><em>t al.&#160;</em>2020). Previous work found that the related <em>Pelobates cultripes </em>exhibits a high degree of heat tolerance in metamorphs and juveniles (Gutiérrez Pesquera 2016), and this may also be true for <em>P. varaldii</em>.&#160;As this species is restricted to coastal lowland areas, and at least one locality close to the sea and below sea level, individual localities may be at risk from sea level rise (Sánchez-Vialas<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017), and premature drying of ponds in mid-spring during dry years can lead to massive larval mortality (D. Escoriza pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>The Tanger-Asilah region, one of the species' likely strongholds - based on larval densities and invertebrate diversity, and the recent discovery of additional localities (Sánchez-Vialas&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017) - lies within a heavily urbanized landscape where its population is likely to be fragmented and further urban development is a potential threat (Hinckley<em> et al</em>. 2016); other localities where these authors detected high numbers of larvae are at risk from overgrazing and intensive farming of adjacent terrestrial habitat, and the presence of a major road within 100-150 m which may result in mortality of migrating adults. Subsequent expansion of the national road may have destroyed several ponds in the Larache region (A. Hinckley pers. comm. 2020). Localities from which the species has apparently been lost may have been impacted by water pollution and eutrophication, road expansion (resulting in both mortality of breeding adults and pollution from runoff - Sánchez-Vialas <em>et al</em>. 2017), and intensive agriculture (Hinckley<em> et al.</em> 2016). The subpopulation south of Tangier airport, which is only known to use a single breeding pond, is under severe threat by the development of a beach resort (de Pous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The La Mamora region retains extensive suitable terrestrial habitat and more than a hundred ponds, but it is impacted by intensive logging, overgrazing and intensive eucalypt plantations (Hinckley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Ponds here are presumed to be directly impacted by water pollution and disturbance resulting from cattle activity, and many ponds were found to exhibit higher levels of nitrate pollution than those elsewhere in the range and to lack vegetation (Hinckley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). The species might also be impacted by traditional well systems in&#160;Maâmora forest, as these act as population sinks which attract amphibians but from which adults are unable to escape (Hinckley<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;<br/><br/>In Ben Slimane, very low densities in the one occupied pond these authors found likely reflect a wide range of threats, including high levels of nitrate pollution (and associated low invertebrate occurrence), intensive wheat agriculture and garbage dumping (Hinckley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Earlier, exhaustive sampling in this region (Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2013, 2014) also recorded the species in only a single pond, however other suitable ponds exist in this area and it may be more widespread in this area but difficult to detect (D. Escoriza pers. comm. 2020). Invasive water fern (<em>Azolla filiculoides</em>) occurs in Ben Slimane province and could represent a threat to this species (Hinckley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/><em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> (<em>Bd</em>) has arrived in Morocco, since the 2006 assessment, and it is possible that this species may be susceptible to the disease chytridiomycosis (de Pous <em>et al.</em> 2012). The disease has been detected in tadpoles of this species (El Mouden<em> et al.</em> 2011).","The La Mamora region is the core distribution area of this species and contains its largest subpopulations, however the species' habitat - and therefore its population - within the whole range is fragmented which is thought to be leading to potential loss of gene flow and genetic variability (de Pous <em>et al</em>. 2012, Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2019). A 2015 survey of 33 sites in part of the species' known and potential distribution recorded larvae of this species in only 12 sites (Hinckley<em> et al. </em>2016). This survey failed to record the species in three sites from which it has previously been recorded in Larache (although it was found in the Larache area by Esoriza and Ben Hassine 2014, and in a single locality here by Hinckley <em>et al.</em> 2016), and it appears to have been lost altogether from Ouezzane (Hinckley<em> et al. </em>2016). A decreasing population trend is inferred from the ongoing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat, and predation by invasive species.",Decreasing,"This species is known from fragmented, localized areas on the coastal plains of northwestern Morocco. Records have also been made south of Ouezzane (Guzmán <em>et al.</em> 2007), which extends its range eastwards, and between Asilah and Tangier, extending its range 50 km northwards (Lapeña <em>et al.</em> 2011), and Ben Slimane (Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>The southernmost subpopulation is known from the northeastern part of the salt marshes of Oualidia. Hinckley <em>et al</em>. (2016) did not record the species here and report that the sole pond with a suitable hydroperiod is subject to extensive pollution. This subpopulation is however known only from a single adult specimen and the aquatic habitat it used is consequently unknown (D. Escoriza pers. comm. 2020). A subsequent visit to Oualidia has also failed to record evidence of a surviving population here; if the species is no longer extant here its true distributional extent will be considerably lower than presently recognized (A. Hinckley pers. comm. 2020). Conversely, the species may range further south than Oualidia, and this possible range extension requires further investigation. The species' elevational range is 0-420 m asl&#160;and its area of occupancy (AOO) has been calculated as being 60 km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>A report from Yus Ramos and Cabo Hernandez (1986) of&#160;<em>Pelobates cultripes</em>&#160;(within which <em>P. varaldii </em>was once included) in the Melilla region (Spain) is far outside the known range of any&#160;<em>Pelobates</em>&#160;species. Yus Ramos (pers. comm. to D. Donaire-Barroso pers. comm. 2020) confirmed that this was not an observation record, and it is considered here to be error resulting from these authors' use of a regional checklist (D. Donaire-Barroso pers. comm. 2018).",There is no significant use of or trade in this species (E. Rodríguez-Rodríguez pers. comm. 2020).,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions In-Place&#160;</em></strong><br/>This species has not been recorded from any protected areas (de Pous <em>et al.</em> 2012). In 2020, it was listed 144 out of 863 of the Evolutionary Distinctive and Globally Endangered (EDGE) amphibian&#160; species.<br/><br/><strong><em>Conservation Needed</em></strong><br/>Identifying sites for protected areas is required for the conservation of this species (de Pous <em>et al</em>. 2012). Protection measures should be aimed at the three major strongholds identified as strongholds for this species by de Pous<em> et al. </em>(2012) and Hinckley<em> et al.</em> (2016): the&#160;Maâmora Forest, Larache and the northern subpopulations in Tanger-Asilah; the discovery of further localities, both at risk, in the Tanger-Asilah region emphasises the urgent need for microreserves and habitat restoration in this area (Sánchez-Vialas&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). These authors recommend fencing some areas of&#160;Maâmora to exclude cattle and banning eucalypt plantations in this area; eradication of invasive crayfish and fish in Larache; and creation of a ""microreserve"" along the coast of Tanger-Asilah where sites are known, and restoration of coastal vegetation to increase connectivity between these sites. They also recommend management, habitat restoration to avoid sediment buildup, and collaboration with developers to protect Foret Diplomatique.<br/><br/><strong><em>Research Needed</em></strong><br/>Further distribution surveys are required to see whether this species occurs more widely (particularly between Rabat and Oualidia - Hinckley <em>et al</em>. 2016), and&#160;the development of a bi-annual monitoring program to assess the long term population&#160; status is required (de Pous <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Ben Slimane area, although home to only one known subpopulation, may represent an important genetic corridor connecting La Mamora with localities south of Casablanca due to the extent of available habitat, and research is needed to clarify the species' distribution in this area (D. Escoriza pers. comm. 2020). The development of a management plan for Mamora forest to reduce negative effects of agriculture, logging and livestock on breeding ponds and habitat, and to reduce the negative impacts of invasive species, is also recommended (de Pous <em>et al</em>. 2012, Escoriza and Ben Hassine 2019). A long-term monitoring programme led by local scientists and environmental organizations, and focused on tracking larval abundance, is recommended (Hinckley <em>et al</em>. 2016). Surveys are recommended to determine whether it occurs in Merja Zerga Biological Reserve or in others within or close to the known distribution, such as Cap Spartel (Hinckley<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). Research into the suitability of habitat restoration - including potential reintroductions to suitable sites identified or created in protected areas (E.

Thus the species is listed here as Near Threatened, but future surveys could show that the species is declining at an even greater rate.","This species breeds on small lakes, pools, bogs and streams of the tundra. It mainly feeds on molluscs but will also take crustaceans, with a more varied diet in summer including insects, arachnids, berries and seeds. It feeds by diving, and will pluck or dabble on the surface. Breeding begins in May or June in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1992)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","<p>Climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Warming and sea ice retreat poses an ongoing and future threat to the species’ habitat as sea ice provides an important resting platform when not foraging (Lovvorn <em>et al</em>. 2009). Reductions in ice habitat are predicted to result in large decreases in the area of viable habitat, even in the absence of other impacts such as shifts in food availability (Lovvorn <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; Such habitat shifts have been seen in almost one third of winters between 1998 and 2011, denying access to preferred foraging locations and forcing prey switching, resulting in adult body fat being one third lower than in winters with access to these resources (Lovvorn <em>et al.</em> 2014). A recent modelling study by Christie <em>et al</em>. (2018) reveals that under an RCP 8.5 scenario, the species's abundance will likely increase through to 2040 before declining rapidly through to near extirpation in the late 21st century as the Bering Sea becomes ice-free. There appears to be no difference in mean survival between widely separated breeding areas, indicating that survival is mainly a function of wintering conditions (Solovyeva <em>et al.</em> 2017). Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for the species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith <em>et al. </em>2005, Riordan <em>et al. </em>2006), while the alteration of habitats through coastal erosion, inundation and salinization from storm surges, thawing permafrost, and sedimentation changes due to sea level rise and increased river discharge could change the suitability of current nesting areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been made for this species yet. Nevertheless, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region, with unknown impacts on the long-term survival of the species (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Climate change has also been held responsible for severely reducing the Eiders’ benthic prey, likely due to ocean acidification (e.g. molluscs which form a large part of Eider diet) (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017); <em>Macoma calcarea</em>,&#160;a key prey of the Spectacled Eider, is evidenced to be decreasing in abundance throughout sites in the Bering Sea, influencing the Eider's winter foraging (Goethel <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Direct persecution poses another major threat to the species, with 10s to 100s of individuals harvested in Alaska and 10,000-14,000 in Russia per annum (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). This represents around 5% annual mortality, based on a population of 330,000 (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Pollution also threatens this species with lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead poisoning from ingested lead shot found in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding population, with levels high enough to influence regional subpopulation dynamics (Flint <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sea Duck Joint Venture 2016). Exposure to lead reduced estimated survival from 0.78 to 0.44 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010), while the survival of females exposed to lead was 0.34 lower than that of those with blood lead levels at or below background levels (Grand <em>et al.</em> 1998). Lead levels exceeding typical exposure thresholds were found in 30.7% of females in the Chaun Delta, Russia between 2003-2010; however, only 8.8% exhibited levels above the critical threshold (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2012, 2020). Lead shot is likely not a serious threat to Siberian populations due to the low human density in the breeding range (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2020).</p>  <p>Oil spills occur in the species range, and although infrequent, represent a significant risk to the population (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). Oil and gas development on the central coast of Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain has altered nesting habitat, causing potential threats from oil contamination, off-road vehicle use, wetland filling as well as the indirect effects of human disturbance (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, the development related to the petroleum industry is not regarded a significant threat to the species as only a small proportion of the species’s range is within or near developed areas. The risk to eiders from collisions and disturbance resulting from industrial activities and interaction with shipping lanes linked to oil and gas development is thought to be low and is unlikely to have population-level effects (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, but at present, the disease appears not to have any significant effects on the population. Seroprevalence of avian influenza in Spectacled Eider is approximately 90% (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013), but less than 5% tested positive for the virus (Ip <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  Arctic Foxes <em>Vulpes lagopus</em> are present in the species’s range and may contribute to mortality through predation. Density of wolverine and now brown bear appear to have increased in low Arctic tundra as a result of climate change impacts (Solovyeva 2016). Modelling of breeding success indicates that predation is likely to be driving reductions in productivity, although factors operating over winter are likely to be the main drivers of observed declines across the range (Solovyeva <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Changes in the species community composition may be also having an effect, with a decline in Sabine’s Gull <em>Xema sabini</em> and Arctic Tern <em>Sterna paradise</em> (which provide nest protection) and an increase in mammalian predators and Vega Gull <em>Larus smithsonianus vegae</em> potentially leading to reduced breeding success (see Solovyeva and Zelenskaya 2016, Solovyeva <em>et al</em>. 2017b). It is possible that these community changes are a result of climate change (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt. </em>2018).","Wetlands International (2020) estimate the global population to number 360,000-400,000 individuals, in line with the 2010 estimate based on aerial surveys of winter flocks in the Bering Sea of 369,122 individuals, rounded here to 370,000 individuals (Larned&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).

Egg-laying occurs all year round, but with a seasonal peak in late spring and summer - over 60% of nesting activity occurring between November and January (Crawford <em>et al. </em>1982). At Malgas Island, South Africa, most breeding takes place between September and April (Crawford <em>et al. </em>1999), while in northern South Africa and southern Namibia, breeding peaks from October to February (Crawford<em> et al. </em>1999). The seasonal pattern in central Namibia requires investigation (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 1999). The species usually breeds in small groups of 4-50 pairs<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><sup>&#160;&#160;</sup></span>Johnsgard 1993), although colonies supporting up to 280 nests have been recorded (Johnsgard 1993). It usually forages solitarily (Harrison <em>et al. </em>1997). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species occurs during both the breeding and the non-breeding season along the coastal cliffs of the mainland and offshore islands in the cold waters of the Benguela Current (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992). It has never been recorded more than 10 km offshore (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992), or more than 100 m inland<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Johnsgard 1993). It forages in shallow coastal waters and estuaries (Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1997), often in kelp beds (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992) and among breaking waves or in tidal pools during periods of high tide (Johnsgard 1993). It does not forage off sandy shores<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Johnsgard 1993). The Crowned Cormorant is a shallow, benthic forager, diving to a mean depth of 2 m, with a maximum of 18 m (T. Cook <em>unpubl. data</em>). <strong>Diet </strong>Diet consists largely (97%) (Williams and Cooper 1983) of benthic fish, particularly klipfish (Clinidae) and pipefish (Syngnathidae) of up to 160 mm in length<strong> </strong>(Williams and Cooper 1983). Shrimps and isopods also form a small part of the diet (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Gobiidae were important in the diet at three colonies located in a lagoon (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2012). <strong>Breeding site </strong>This species commonly breeds in mixed seabird colonies. Nest sites include sheltered areas on rocks, cliffs, bushes, small trees, and kelp wracks, as well as man-made structures including jetties, old buildings, the supports of guano platforms, wrecked ships and sometimes moored ships<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Nelson 2005). The nest is constructed mostly from kelp and sticks, lined with finer material, and they are often used for several years in succession (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). A clutch usually consists of two or three eggs (but occasionally of up to five) (Williams and Cooper 1983), typically producing two chicks, normally from the first two eggs laid (Williams and Cooper 1983). After leaving the nest, chicks form crèches near the colony.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>Human disturbance may pose a significant threat to the species (Orta<em> et al. </em>2020). In a meta-analysis, Carney<em>&#160;</em>and Sydeman (1999) showed that most seabird species are negatively affected by human disturbance. Chicks may be crushed as adults are flushed from the nest, and temporary or permanent abandonment of nests leaves nestlings vulnerable to predation. Harrison&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1997) found this species to be particularly susceptible to human disturbance.</p><p>Invasive Cape Fur Seal&#160;<em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em>&#160;and Great White Pelican&#160;<em>Pelecanus onocrotalus</em>&#160;pose substantial threats to the species. Predation by Cape Fur Seals, particularly on fledglings, has escalated due to increases in seal in the Benguela ecosystem following the protection of the seal&#160;(David&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Out of 13 carcasses found on Dyer Island, 69% displayed wounds identified as inflicted by Cape Fur Seals (Johnson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Pelican predation on seabirds has intensified in recent years (de Ponte Machado 2007, Mwema&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). During the 2005/06 and 2006/07 breeding seasons, Great White Pelicans depredated all the Crowned Cormorant nests in the lighthouse colony on Dassen Island (one of South Africa’s largest colonies), accountable for more than 200 nests each year and 13% of the national population in 2006/07 (de Ponte Machado 2007, Mwema&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). In the same year (2006), breeding success was reduced from the normal 1.3 to 0.08 fledglings per nest (Mwema&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). These observations demonstrate that the species is highly vulnerable to pelican predation.</p><p>Mortality due to entanglement in fishing-gear and other man-made materials is another concern (T. Dodman&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2000, J. Kemper <em>pers. obs.</em>). Cormorants are notorious for picking up floating debris to use as nesting material, exposing both adults and chicks to the risk of entanglement and death from starvation. Mortality associated with this type of pollution appears to be low, but few systematic studies have been conducted. All indications are that the amount of debris and number of incidences have increased substantially (Tasker&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000) and hence may constitute a threat of increasing severity in the future.</p><p>The 2000 Treasure oil spill caused some mortality of the species, (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2000).&#160;</p><p></p>","The most recent population estimate, based on survey counts, is 944 pairs in Namibia and 1,218 pairs in South Africa (A.

During both the incubation and the chick-rearing periods, birds nesting on Tern Island forage widely throughout the North Pacific, including to the distant, productive California Current waters along the west coast of North America (Fernandez <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kappes <em>et al. </em>2010). In contrast, during the brooding period, birds from Tern Island forage predominantly within 500 to 800 km of the island (Hyrenbach <em>et al</em>. 2002, Conners <em>et al.</em> 2015, Gutowsky <em>et al.</em> 2015, Kappes <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p></p>","<p>Incidental capture in commercial fisheries represents a threat to the majority of the population. Between 1978 and 1992, the population experienced elevated mortality from interactions with high seas drift-nets in the North Pacific (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1993). The estimated bycatch rates of Black-footed Albatrosses has fluctuated over the past 50 years, generally ranging between 6,000 and10,000 birds per annum (Naughton <em>et al.</em> 2007); in 2003, mortality was estimated to be at least 2,000 birds per year in the U.S. pelagic longline fleet based in Hawaii, and a further 6,000 in Japanese and Taiwanese fleets (Lewison and Crowder 2003). Recent observer data from the Hawaii longline fisheries, from 2010 to 2015 indicate that deep-set longlines captured an estimated 66 to 535 individuals each year and shallow-set longlines captured an observed 19-49 individuals per year. It has been recently estimated that on average 227 individuals are taken annually in the Alaskan federal groundfish and Pacific Halibut <em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em> fisheries (in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of Alaska Fishery Management Plan areas), which also target Pacific Cod <em>Gadus microcephalus</em> and Sablefish <em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>. Along the west coast of the U.S.A., Black-footed Albatrosses interacting with fleets harvesting Sablefish and Pacific Hake <em>Merluccius productus</em> are exposed to an elevated mortality risk (Guy <em>et al</em>. 2013). In 2012, it was estimated that between 2006 and 2009, from 25 to 128 albatrosses (assumed to all be Black-footed Albatross) were taken annually in Canada’s Pacific demersal longline groundfish fisheries, with a predicted yearly average mortality of 85 birds (DFO 2012). Bycatch rates in the Japanese and Taiwanese longline fleets are largely unknown. However, studies on this species have confirmed the impact of fisheries bycatch on survival (Verán <em>et al</em>. 2007) and the annual population growth rate (Niel and Lebreton 2005). Tracking studies show that post-breeding birds disperse over large distances to the oceanographic 'transition zone' where they are susceptible to bycatch in the various pelagic longline fleets (Hyrenbach and Dotson 2003, BirdLife International 2004, Hyrenbach <em>et al</em>. 2006, Zydelis <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gutowsky <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Within this area, tracking revealed that fishing effort was heavy in the habitats utilised by the species, and that there may be a male bias in the individuals affected by bycatch.</p>  <p>Around the turn of the 20th century, the species suffered sharp declines due to feather hunting (Spennemann 1998). Protective measures and the cessation of feather hunting allowed the population to recover (ACAP 2010).</p>  <p>Climate change poses an ongoing threat in terms of storms and flooding, and a future threat in terms of habitat alteration. The vast majority of the world population nests on islands below 10 m, above sea-level and it is predicted that with climate change and the resulting rise in sea-level, there will be significant inundation and loss of low-lying atolls/islands that are currently used for nesting (Storlazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013, Reynolds <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p>  Other potential threats include volcanic eruptions (Harrison 1990), pollution from agricultural effluents and solid waste including organochlorine (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1996, Auman <em>et al</em>. 1997, Guruge <em>et al.</em> 2001), mercury, PCB and DDE (Ludwig <em>et al</em>. 1998, Guruge et <em>al.</em> 2001, Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007) and oil spills (Fefer <em>et al.</em> 1984, NOAA 1992).","<p>Between 1995 and 2017, the average number of breeding pairs per season was c.69,900, which equates to 139,800 mature individuals (ACAP 2017).</p>",Increasing,"<p><em>Phoebastria nigripes</em> breeds on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>), the <strong>U.S. Minor Outlying Islands</strong> and four outlying islands off <strong>Japan. </strong>In the past, individual pairs have also bred in Mexico on Guadalupe and San Benedicto islands; however the species has not bred on either island for at least 20 years (ACAP 2010). Colonies have been lost from other Pacific islands (Whittow 1993, Cousins 1998). In total there are estimated to be 70,069 pairs breeding each year (Flint 2007, Naughton <em>et al.</em> 2007, ACAP 2017) in at least 16 locations. The largest population counts have been 28,610 pairs at Midway Atoll for hatch year 2015 and 24, 565 pairs at Laysan Island for hatch year 2012.

The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. DD was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and across a substantial swath of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere and is not rare, therefore the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied. Therefore, it was concluded that the species does not belong in the DD category.</p>  <p>There is little information on abundance or trends in abundance for this species but regular although infrequent sightings suggest it is uncommon. Typical threats that may result in declines in abundance, namely anthropogenic noise and fisheries bycatch, are not prevalent in most of the range of this species, making LC the more plausible category.</p>","<p>This species generally occurs in deep, cold temperate and subpolar waters, especially in areas with steep-bottomed slopes beyond the continental shelf edge (Kasuya 2009). However, some sightings have been associated with shallower regions, coastal waters, continental slopes or seamounts (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Hobson and Martin (1996) observed groups of Arnoux’s Beaked Whales near the Antarctic Peninsula and found that their breath-holding capabilities make this species one of the most accomplished mammalian divers, capable of swimming up to an estimated 7 km between breathing sites in sea ice. The species seems well-adapted to life in ice-covered waters and may be able to exploit food resources inaccessible to other predators in the region (Ponganis <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/> <br/> Little is known of the feeding habits of Arnoux's Beaked Whales but they are assumed to be similar to those of their Northern Hemisphere relatives, Baird's Beaked Whales, with primary prey species consisting of benthic and pelagic fishes and cephalopods (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Culik 2004). Therefore, Brownell and Ainley (2009) suggested that Antarctic toothfish and the most-caught by-catch species, macrourids, in the Area 88 fishery are likely important components in their diet.</p>","<p>Arnoux’s Beaked Whale has never been hunted to any significant degree, and direct anthropogenic threats are not known. However, a few whales have been taken for scientific study (see Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Considering that some beaked whale species are known to be vulnerable to large-mesh pelagic driftnets (e.g. Californian drift-netting for swordfish and sharks (Barlow and Cameron 2003), it is likely that Arnoux’s Beaked Whales were caught in the large-scale drift-netting in the Tasman sea. Although current levels of bycatch are unknown, they are likely to be low due to adoption in 1989 of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly, which called for effective conservation and management measures of living marine resources in areas of high seas drift-netting. Developing high-latitude fisheries, such as that for Antarctic toothfish, a significant proportion of which is illegal and unregulated, have the potential to reduce food available for large predators.<br/> <br/> In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;However, this species’ range probably puts it largely outside the major areas of such impacts.</p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018).

Branch &amp; Butterworth (2001), on the other hand, estimated 72,000 and 54,000 such whales on the basis of the second and third circumpolar IWC cetacean surveys, respectively. The estimates by these two sets of authors differ by what correction factor was used to address the “sightability” of the whales. The ratio of Arnoux’s beaked whales to southern bottlenose whales in these surveys was 18:1040. Therefore, the estimate for Arnoux’s beaked whales would be 5000 and 3000, respectively (Brownell and Ainley 2009). However, neither estimate accounts for Arnoux’s beaked whales in sea-ice covered areas where they have been frequently observed.&#160;  <p>Arnoux's Beaked Whales seem to be relatively abundant in southern New Zealand around Doubtful Sound and in Cook Strait, at least during summer, and occasionally around Tasmania.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Arnoux's Beaked Whales are found in a circumpolar pattern in the southern Hemisphere from the Antarctic continent and ice edges (ca. 78°S) north to about 34°S in the South Pacific (Kasuya 2009).

Sightings are regularly reported such that the species can be considered uncommon but nowhere within this range are they very well known or considered common. Most of the reported sightings are from the Doubtful Sound, New Zealand; Tasman Sea and around the Albatross Cordillera in the South Pacific (MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006).

All Common Dolphins are now classified as <em>Delphinus delphis</em> and are covered in this updated Red List assessment. &#160;</p>  <p>Common Dolphins are widely distributed from tropical to cool temperate waters of both hemispheres in all major ocean basins. They occur in a range of habitats from nearshore to offshore waters. They are one of the most widespread and abundant cetacean species globally. Available estimates indicate that there are well over 6 million individuals, and actual abundance is probably considerably higher, as many areas within the species range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, have never been surveyed.</p>  <p>Common Dolphins are often bycaught in fishing gear throughout their range and several populations are of conservation concern, including the Black Sea subspecies, which is classified as Vulnerable (Birkun 2008), the Mediterranean subpopulation, which is Endangered (Bearzi 2003, Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2020b), and the Gulf of Corinth subpopulation in Greece, which is Critically Endangered (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Other factors that likely affect the conservation status of Common Dolphins in some areas include prey depletion caused by overfishing, underwater noise, contamination by xenobiotics and global climate disruption. Despite this, the species remains one of the most widespread and abundant cetaceans and, although several local populations have declined dramatically, much of the range is in less impacted parts of the ocean, and there is no evidence that the threats are resulting in a global population decline. <em>Delphinus delphis</em> was listed (under the older taxonomic concept, excluding <em>D. capensis</em>) as Least Concern in 2008; it remains Least Concern in this updated assessment.</p>","<p>Common Dolphins inhabit tropical and warm-temperate waters of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In the Indo-Pacific, they are found mostly in continental shelf waters, and generally do not occur around oceanic islands far from mainland coasts (Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2002). Elsewhere, Common Dolphins have been reported to prefer upwelling-modified waters, areas with steep sea-floor relief, and shelf areas (Evans 1994). </p>  <p>In the Mediterranean and in European waters generally, Common Dolphins inhabit both coastal (neritic) and offshore (pelagic) waters, but they seem to prefer continental shelf waters and areas of high productivity, such as upwelling regions (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2003, Saavedra <em>et al.</em> in press). In the Black Sea, Common Dolphins occur in both continental shelf and pelagic waters (Birkun 2008, Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2019). </p>  <p>The short-beaked form of common dolphins in the eastern central Pacific (<em>Delphinus delphis delphis</em>) extends far off the continental shelf in temperate waters with a distinct break in tropical equatorial waters.&#160; The long-beaked form (<em>Delphinus delphis bairdii</em>) &#160;in the same regions is strictly found in waters inshore of the shelf break (Hamilton<em> et al. </em>2009). Associations with other marine mammal species are common. Mixed-species groups of Common and Striped Dolphins (<em>Stenella coeruleoalba</em>) are observed frequently in Mediterranean and European waters (Saavedra <em>et al</em>. In press). Common Dolphins also sometimes associate with Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala</em> spp.) and a number of other small delphinids (Evans 1994, Quérouil <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; Common Dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) are sometimes associated with Yellowfin Tuna (<em>Thunnus albacares)</em> and have thus been captured in tuna purse seines (Gerrodette 2018).</p>  <p>Common Dolphins are highly social animals that live in groups ranging from a few tens to several thousands of individuals (Perrin 2018, Saavedra <em>et al.</em> in press). Their prey normally consists of epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes and a smaller proportion of squids. Prey can include gadids, small scombroids, clupeoids and both loliginid and ommastrephid squids (Perrin 2018, Saavedra <em>et al</em>. in press). Diet studies suggest both opportunism and specialization (e.g. Santos <em>et al.</em> 2013), with a preference overall for energy-rich prey (Meynier <em>et al.</em> 2008, Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2010). </p>","Common Dolphins are one of the most widespread, abundant and well-studied cetacean species.&#160; As such there is a lot of information regarding threats, which is summarized below.&#160; Despite this, much of the range includes remote, oceanic waters where threats are likely to be relatively low. <br/><br/><u><strong>Bycatch</strong></u><br/>Globally, Common Dolphins are sometimes bycaught in fishing gear, including in purse seines, drifting and set gillnets, trawl nets, and longlines. In the Eastern Tropical Pacific, they are sometimes found in association with Yellowfin Tuna and the annual incidental mortality of Common Dolphins in the tuna purse-seine fishery was estimated to be as high as 24,000 in 1986 (IATTC 2017). After the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) imposed per-vessel catch limits on the international fleet, the mortality estimate of Common Dolphins declined to 127 in 2016 (IATTC 2017). Catches of Common Dolphins have also been recorded in purse-seine fisheries in the Indian Ocean and off the west coast of Africa (Anderson et al. 2020, Simmons 1968). Tuna driftnet fisheries in the Indian Ocean are estimated to have killed a total of 4.1 million small cetaceans between 1950-2018, an unknown proportion of which would have been Common Dolphins (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2020). Common Dolphins were the most frequently reported cetaceans taken in the U.S. driftnet fishery for sharks and swordfish, with about 2,100 estimated killed between 1990 and 2002 (Julian and Beeson 1998, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2005); measures taken since 1996 to reduce the cetacean bycatch in this fishery have been largely effective, and it is no longer a population-level concern for Common Dolphins (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>In the western Atlantic, average annual estimated fishery-related mortality of Common Dolphins during 2013–2017 was 419 individuals (CV=0.10), with the highest mortality occurring in the US mid-Atlantic bottom trawl fishery (Hayes et al. 2020). By-catches have also been reported from other areas and likely occur in most parts of the species’ range (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2000, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2003, Saavedra et al. in press, Zerbini and Kotas 1998).<br/><br/>Incidental mortality in fishing gear, especially driftnets, has undoubtedly contributed to the decline of Common Dolphins in the Mediterranean (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2003). Driftnets were reported to kill a few hundred Common Dolphins per year in the Alboràn Sea alone during the early 1990s (Silvani <em>et al</em>. 1999). In EU waters, driftnets have been prohibited since 2002, but they are still being used illegally in much of the Mediterranean region.<br/><br/><u><strong>Directed Takes</strong></u><br/>In the Black Sea large numbers of cetaceans were taken in directed hunts in the past. The total number of animals killed is not known, but it was estimated that before the mid 1950s Common Dolphins comprised 95% of the total number of Black Sea cetaceans killed in the former Soviet Union (Tzalkin 1940, Kleinenberg 1956). Based on this value, it was calculated that during the last five years of the cetacean hunt in the USSR and Bulgaria (1962–1966), these two countries landed over 121,000 Common Dolphins, while during the preceding 31 years (1931-61) another 1.5 million had been landed mainly by the USSR (Zemsky 1996). Between 1976 and 1981, <em>D. d. ponticus</em> was believed to account for 15–16% (or 37,500–40,000 individuals) of the Turkish catch, estimated for that period as 250,000 animals of all three species (IWC 1983, Birkun 2008). Directed takes of Common Dolphins for human consumption and shark bait are still a threat in Peru (Mintzer <em>et al</em>. 2018). In the 1990s many Common Dolphins were killed by harpooning around Margarita Island, off eastern Venezuela (Romero <em>et al</em>. 2001); it is not clear if such killing continues. The annual catch of Common Dolphins in the dolphin hunt in Japan in the early 1970s was over 8,000 individuals, peaking at 9,032 in 1973 (Kasuya 2017). The catch levels declined slowly, so that through most of the 1980s and early 1990s annual mortality was down to several hundred, and since 1993 it has been less than 10 animals (Kasuya 2017). Common Dolphins were (and may still be) taken in small numbers in the directed cetacean hunt in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/><u><strong>Prey Depletion</strong></u><br/>Reduced prey availability resulting from overfishing was considered one of the primary causes of the regional decline of Common Dolphins in the Gulf of Vera, Spain (Cañadas and Hammond 2008), in the Gulf of Naples, Italy (Mussi <em>et al</em>. 2019), and in the Ionian Sea Archipelago, Greece (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2006, Piroddi <em>et al</em>. 2011). Of two mass mortality events that killed several hundred Black Sea Common Dolphins in 1990 and 1994 (Krivokhizhin and Birkun 1999), the latter was the result of a morbillivirus epizootic. However, both die-offs coincided with a drastic (8- to 12-fold) decline in the abundance of the two main Common Dolphin prey species, anchovy and sprat, and reduced prey availability is considered to be a major threat to Black Sea Common Dolphins (Bushuyev 2000). The correlation between large die-offs and prey scarcity suggests that the undernourishment has increased the dolphins’ susceptibility to viral infections in that area (Birkun 2008).<br/><br/><u><strong>Other Threats</strong></u><br/>In European waters, Common Dolphins carry levels of PCBs that appear to be lower than those of other cetacean species (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2016), but health issues likely due to PCBs are nonetheless observable. For instance, high concentrations of PCBs in Common Dolphins from the NE Atlantic were related to reproductive failure (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among some cetaceans and may also threaten Common Dolphins (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The stomachs of 35 Common Dolphins stranded in Galicia, NW Spain, all contained microplastics (Hernández-Gonzalez <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Noise produced by naval vessels and helicopters during a military exercise was considered the most probable cause of a mass stranding in the United Kingdom in 2008, involving at least 26 Common Dolphins (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2013).","This is a widespread species and the available abundance estimates are primarily from the Northern Hemisphere. There are very few abundance estimates from the Southern Hemisphere, which constitutes a large portion of the species range. Studies of Common Dolphin abundance in each ocean basin or sea are summarized (but not exhaustively) below.<br/><br/><u><strong>Pacific Ocean</strong></u><br/>The abundance of Common Dolphins in the eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) was estimated from eight vessel-based line-transect surveys conducted between 1986 and 2000 as 2,963,000 (CV=24%) (Gerrodette and Forcada 2002). In 2006, Common Dolphins were again judged to be the most abundant cetaceans in the ETP and were estimated at 3,127,203 (CV=26%) individuals (Gerrodette <em>et al</em>. 2008). The most recent estimate of abundance off California, Oregon and Washington, determined from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line transect surveys was 969,861 (CV = 0.17) Short-beaked Common Dolphins, and 101,305 (CV=0.49) Eastern North Pacific Long-beaked Common Dolphins (Barlow 2016). These estimates include correction factors for animals missed during the surveys (Barlow 2016).<br/><br/>There are an estimated 1.4 million Common Dolphins in the Western Pacific off Japan (Kanaji <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Ship survey data from 2009 resulted in an estimated total of 279,000 dolphins of the <em>Delphinus delphis bairdii </em>subspecies along the west coast of Baja California and the California coast (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2011). A total of just over 12,000 Common Dolphins (<em>Delphinus delphis delphis</em>) was estimated in the EEZ of Colombia based on surveys conducted between 1986 and 2008 (Gerrodette and Palacios 1996).<br/><br/><u><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong></u><br/>The best estimate of abundance in the western North Atlantic is 172,825 (CV=0.21) based on Canadian and U.S. surveys conducted in 2016 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2020). Abundance in European continental shelf and offshore waters (not including the Mediterranean and Black seas) was estimated as 467,000 (CV=0.26) dolphins based on aerial and vessel surveys in 2016; the majority of sightings were in the Bay of Biscay and coastal waters of France and Spain (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some 62,000 Common Dolphins were estimated to be present in 1993 west of the Bay of Biscay, in the area of the albacore tuna driftnet fishery (Goujon 1996).<br/><br/><u><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></u><br/>Once one of the most common species in this region, Common Dolphins have experienced a generalized and major decline since the 1970s (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2003). In 2018, aerial surveys covering a large part of the region indicated low abundance across most of the Mediterranean subpopulation's range, and an absence or near absence of Common Dolphins within areas known to have hosted large numbers historically. The sum of mean estimates for the inner Mediterranean strata (Mediterranean minus the Alboràn Sea) was 5,200 Common Dolphins (95% CI 1890-14305; ASI 2020; Bearzi et al. 2020b). The Common Dolphin subpopulation in the Mediterranean region is listed as Endangered (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/><u><strong>Water bodies within the Mediterranean Sea</strong></u><br/>Common Dolphins have almost completely vanished from the Adriatic Sea, where they used to be abundant (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2004, Genov <em>et al</em>. 2020). In the Gulf of Vera, Balearic Sea, Common Dolphin numbers decreased threefold from 1992–1995 to 1996–2004 (Cañadas and Hammond 2008). Dramatic negative trends in abundance were recorded in the eastern Ionian Sea (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2006). Only a few individuals survive in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Corinth, Greece (Frantzis and Herzing 2002, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2016), where the subpopulation has been assessed as Critically Endangered (Santostasi <em>et al</em>. 2018, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/><u><strong>Black Sea</strong></u><br/>According to Birkun (2008), there may be at least several tens of thousands and possibly more than 100,000 Common Dolphins in the Black Sea. This population was, however, heavily hunted for centuries: over 160,000 animals were killed between 1962 and 1983, likely resulting in a significant population decline Birkun (2008). Aerial surveys carried out in 2019 in southern and western Black Sea waters resulted in 716 sightings of Common Dolphins involving 1751 individuals (Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2019). Abundance estimates from these surveys are not yet available.<br/><br/><u><strong>Indian Ocean</strong></u><br/>No estimates exist for the northern Indian Ocean, and there are only a few for small areas of the southern Indian Ocean/Indo-Pacific. About 15,000–20,000 Common Dolphins were estimated to occur off South Africa (Cockcroft and Peddemors 1990), and approximately 21,000 were estimated for a localised region off southern Australia (Bilgmann <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/><u><strong>Global totals</strong></u><br/>Taken together, the above estimates suggest a total of several million Common Dolphin worldwide. Considering that large portions of the species’ range have not been surveyed, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, the actual abundance is certainly higher than the sum of the estimates for the surveyed areas.",Unknown,"<p>The Common Dolphin is a widely distributed oceanic species that occurs from tropical to cool temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans (Perrin 2018). Within the Atlantic Ocean, it appears to be absent from the Gulf of Mexico and from of the Caribbean Sea (except for the region around Venezuela, where a coastal population occurs; Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2009). It occurs in a range of habitat types, including nearshore waters as well as open-sea waters thousands of kilometres offshore. Common Dolphins regularly occur in some enclosed seas, such as the Okhotsk Sea and Sea of Japan, and separate subpopulations exist in the Mediterranean Sea and a subspecies in the Black Sea. Once one of the most common cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea, the Common Dolphins there have undergone a generalized and major reduction in geographic range since the 1970s (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2003). Common Dolphins occur as far south as southeastern South Africa and Namibia in Africa; southern Australia and New Zealand; and Argentina and northern Chile (Finday <em>et al</em>. 1992, Durante <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Northern Hemisphere they extend to the UK, Norway, Korea, Japan and Canada (Caputo <em>et al</em>. 2017, Song <em>et al</em>. 2014, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Common Dolphins occur regularly in the Persian Gulf (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2010, Preen 2004) and in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p>Distributions of the four currently recognized subspecies of Common Dolphins are as follows:</p>  <ul><li><em>Delphinus delphis delphis</em>: the nominate subspecies occurs throughout the entire range of the species, except the Black Sea and Indian Ocean.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Delphinus delphis bairdii</em>: this subspecies appears to be found in distinct areas and apparently-disjunct subpopulations are known from central California to southern Mexico, and possibly Peru.

It is very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012).&#160;The species is also threatened by conversion of land to agriculture, which may also reduce prey species (Jennings &amp; Sadler 2006; Sanchez-Zapata <em>et al. </em>2003). An increase in orchards and vineyards has reduced suitable habitat in Bulgaria (Demerdzhiev <em>et al</em>. 2014). Electrocution has also caused fatalities (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). In Saudi Arabia, stone quarrying has reduced populations (Jennings &amp; Sadler 2006). In China and Bulgaria, rubbish and waste materials used in nest construction were identified as potential causes of nest failures (Wu <em>et al</em>. 2008; Milchev &amp; Georgiev 2012). In Cyprus, poisoning (from poisoned goat carcasses intended to protect livestock from red foxes), shooting and disturbance at nest sites are the main threats (Kassinis 2009). The species has been recorded for sale at animal markets in Lebanon, Kuwait and Jordan (Abi-Said&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018; Al-Sirhan &amp; Al-Bathali 2010; Eid&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). In its Sahelian range, the species is vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing, burning and exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007).

It favours scattered shrubby vegetation, typically comprising xerophytic or halophytic plants (Collar 1996). Those wintering in Iran have been shown to prefer more densely vegetated bush-steppe to sparser shrub-steppe; however, within those bush-steppe habitats they favour areas with reduced vegetation cover (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Bush-steppe is thought to contain a higher abundance of food sources such as<em> Salsola</em> spp. and arthropods (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). Birds wintering in Iran also routinely visit neighbouring farmland where alfalfa and salad rocket is grown, but avoid pistachio crops (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although dense vegetation may provide a sanctuary from danger, as well as thermal protection when overnight temperatures drop in winter (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al.</em> 2010), more open, unvegetated areas are often favoured as night-time roosts in order to minimise the risk of ambush by nocturnal predators (Combreau and Smith 1997). On the breeding grounds, nesting females may also favour sites away from vegetation patches, which could provide cover for predators (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2012). Abundance of breeding males has been found to be higher in flat areas with shorter shrub vegetation which is likely to be more suitable for displaying (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<br/><p>The species feeds throughout the day, but is most active at dawn and dusk (Combreau and Launay 1996). It has an eclectic diet, mainly comprising plants and invertebrates (especially ants Formicidae and beetles Tenebrionidae: Tigar and Osborne 2000), but also including vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, small snakes and even young birds (Collar 1996, Tourenq <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/></p><p>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996). Males play no part in rearing the young, and a brood may contain young sired by several different individuals (Lesobre <em>et al</em>. 2010). Females create a shallow scrape in the ground in which they typically lay 3-4 eggs, and occasionally up to six eggs in long-distance migrants (Collar 1996, Combreau <em>et al</em>. 2002). The incubation period is typically 24 days, whilst fledging takes around 35 days.<br/></p><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting (primarily using falconry), largely but not exclusively on the species's wintering grounds (Judas <em>et al. </em>2009). Large numbers are also trapped, mainly in Pakistan and Iran, and shipped to Arabia for use in the training of falcons (Combreau 2007); hunting and trapping are responsible for more than 50% of mortality in Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;In 2014 an illegal shipment of 240 birds was intercepted en route from Pakistan to Bahrain (Shafaeipour <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Arab countries, the meat of this species is considered an aphrodisiac, attracting hunters of high status (Nabi <em>et al., </em>2019); in 2017-2019, permits for hunting of the Asian Houbara were given by Pakistan to royal Arabs, and unregulated hunting seems to be continuing. Eggs are also collected during the breeding season (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021). In recent years the species has been heavily hunted in Iraq, as the country has opened up to visits by hunters from other countries (R. Porter&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>In parts of the region, fast-paced development related to the growth of the petroleum industry has reduced the availability of undisturbed habitats and further exacerbated the species's decline. Oil exploration, road building, oil and water pipelines, mining and quarrying activities, powerlines and the general disturbance caused by four-wheel drive vehicles have all been identified as significant auxiliary threats.  Powerlines in particular may be a significant threat (M. Koshkin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Preliminary data from Uzbekistan suggests that powerlines may contribute to species mortality (Burnside <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Livestock grazing is reported to have a negative impact on the species, both indirectly, by degrading the desert vegetation on which birds rely for food and concealment, and directly, through the trampling of nests and disturbance of nesting females (Lavee 1988). Recent research on the effects of pastoralism on this species in the Kyzylkum Desert in Uzbekistan, however, has found that low intensity livestock grazing may not widely degrade rangelands at a landscape scale (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has no effect on male abundance and female nesting success (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b). In Iran, loss of habitat to croplands, mainly through the planting of pistachio, has been judged to be a significant threat (Mansoori 2006); however, it has also been found that the species exploits other crops such as alfalfa and salad rocket (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Yousefi (2017) reported a high degree of dependence on habitats in the vicinity of croplands, with habitats more than 6 km away losing their suitability. In Saudi Arabia, eggs and nests are predated by a range of mammalian predators (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p>Habitat modelling and climate projections predict an increase in suitable habitat in the future, including shifts in geographic distribution of suitable habitat (Yousefi <em>et al., </em>2017); however, the probability of chick survival may decrease in areas with relatively higher temperatures (Koshkin <em>et al., </em>2016), and higher mortality has been reported from Iran in harsh wintering conditions (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).<br/><br/>The primary conservation approach for this species has been captive-breeding and release, however this may be unsustainable and detrimental to wild populations. Over reliance on supplementation of wild populations with captive-bred individuals risks domestication and replacement, rather than conservation reinforcement, with the potential of release of less-fit individuals causing a long-term reduction in the size, genetic diversity and viability of wild populations (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018). With the current extent of unregulated harvest, one model reports that wild populations would require releasing over 3000 captive-bred females a year, more than the initial wild stock, to attain population stabilisation (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018).&#160;Releasing captive-bred stock may also create the allusion that mitigation measures are successful, which can lead to increased hunting pressure.","The population was last estimated to be between 78,960 and 97,000 individuals globally (O. Combreau&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014, BirdLife International 2014), and stated as poorly known in 2016 (BirdLife International). Studies since have primarily focused on nest site selection and reintroduced populations; available data on breeding parameters of wild populations are insufficient (Azar&#160;<em>et al.,&#160;</em>2018). Accurately establishing the global population is extremely challenging. The population is expected to fall within the population band for 50,000-99,999 individuals, which is assumed to equate to c.33,000-67,000 mature individuals. The breeding population in Kazakhstan has been estimated at c.49,000 individuals (Riou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;extends from <strong>Egypt</strong> east of the Nile, through <strong>Israel</strong>, <strong>Palestine</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Yemen</strong>, <strong>Oman</strong>, <strong>U.A.E.</strong>, <strong>Bahrain</strong>, <strong>Qatar</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Kuwait</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> and <strong>Mongolia</strong> to<strong> China</strong>.

The species is considered Critically Endangered on the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015). Studies have been conducted into the status, ecology and migration of the species in various parts of its range, most notably Kazakhstan (Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002, Tourenq <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;O.

Through its network of breeding facilities in the U.A.E., Morocco and Kazakhstan, the International Fund for Houbara Conservation (IFHC) has a long-term goal to produce 35,000 Asian Houbaras each year for reintroduction into the wild (IFHC 2014). The first releases were made in Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in central Saudi Arabia in 1991. This population is currently estimated to number 250–300 individuals. Further releases have taken place elsewhere in Saudi  Arabia (including at Saja Umm ar Rimth with c.50 individuals [M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016]) and also in U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Yemen, Jordan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. By the end of 2016, 13,504 houbara had been released into the UAE (Azar <em>et al., </em>2018). It is not yet clear what impact the releases of captive-reared birds have on the demographics and genetic integrity of the overall population,&#160;however according to Burnside <em>et al.</em> (2016), in order to compensate for the loss of wild adults to hunting, the number of released birds may need to be as much as 10 times higher than hunting quotas. At least three birds have been satellite tracked from Saudi Arabia to the breeding grounds in Kazakhstan (Zafar-ul Islam <em>et al</em>. 2014). The CMS Asian Houbara Agreement (2005) urges all range countries to take necessary measures to prevent the extinction of any population of Houbara and maintain a favourable status.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The most urgently needed conservation measures are those that will reduce exploitation to a biologically sustainable level. This will require precautionary and scientifically determined limits on the number of birds that can be harvested legally and stricter enforcement of bans on illegal forms of trade and hunting; it also requires in-depth studies of natural productivity in Asian Houbaras in relation to habitat selection and predator abundance. Carry out further surveys to gain an improved estimate of the overall population size and trend; continue research to determine the migration routes, schedules and strategies of all populations. Survey the species throughout the wintering range (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Produce a range-wide action and recovery plan, based on agreement under the Convention on Migratory Species; the CMS Asian Houbara Agreement has been drafted but has not been opened for signature. Develop and implement national and regional species action plans (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Create managed protected areas and review current protected areas. For example, approximately 85% of suitable habitat are outside the existing protected area network of Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;Where they can be shown to be detrimental, reduce grazing and other farming pressures (Goriup 1997, Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004). Establish long-term, range-wide population monitoring studies.

It is therefore classified as Endangered.<p></p>,"It inhabits areas of steppe and semi-desert, and is recorded breeding up to 2,300 m in mountainous regions (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;It feeds mainly on small mammals on its breeding grounds, with susliks forming the vast majority of its diet in some areas; when wintering it appears to feed mainly on mole rats in East Africa, and termites and Red-billed Quelea&#160;<em>Quelea quelea</em>&#160;predominate in southern Africa (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;Nests have traditionally been built as large platforms on the ground, although recent habitat alterations seem to have caused a shift to building a few metres higher in bushes or trees (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). It also nests on artificial structures and will occur on rubbish grounds and waste sites (Keijmel 2019).&#160;The species is migratory, with birds wintering in south-east Africa and southern Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrants leave their breeding grounds between August and October/November, returning between January and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Subedi 2014). It avoids sea crossings and thus forms large concentrations at bottleneck sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","The species has declined in the west of its breeding range, including extirpation from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, as a result of the conversion of steppes to agricultural land combined with direct persecution (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Boesman 2013).&#160;It is also adversely affected by power lines and is very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (STRIX 2012, Meyburg and Boesman 2013). It was recently found to be the raptor most frequently electrocuted by power lines in a study in western Kazakhstan (Levin and Kurkin 2013) and in Saudi Arabia (Shobrak <em>et al. </em>2021). Three sets of factors have been identified as having detrimental impacts on the species in Russia and Kazakhstan: increased mortality owing to collisions with power lines, pesticide poisoning and direct persecution; a reduction in the area of suitable habitat and availability of food, historically due to overgrazing but now due to undergrazing, and to a lesser extent logging and mining; poor breeding success owing to destruction of nests and juvenile mortality during spring fires, entanglement of nestlings in artificial nest materials, and disturbance by people and livestock (Strategy of the Steppe Eagle Conservation in the Russian Federation 2016). Young eagles are taken out of the nest in order to sell them to western European countries (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). Recent studies using social media to assess impacts on wildlife found that the species was also being illegally killed in Jordan, of which the species is legally protected in the country (Eid and Handal 2018). A decline in the number of birds and a reduction in the proportion of juveniles migrating over Eilat, Israel began immediately after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, leading Yosef and Fornadari (2004) to suggest that the species may have been affected by radioactive contamination. This species is vulnerable to the veterinary drug diclofenac (Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014), which was intensively used in the species's wintering range in Pakistan and India (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004).","Combined totals from across the whole range estimate the number of pairs at 31,372 (26,014-36,731), which equates to 62,744 (52,028-73,462) mature individuals or 94,116 (78,042-110,193) individuals (I. Karyakin <em>in litt</em>. 2015). The global population is hence below 37,000 pairs (Karyakin <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"This species breeds east of 43°E in European <strong>Russia</strong> from the Republic of Kalmykia (I.

In Russia the population is estimated to be 2,478–3,688 breeding pairs (including 1,176–1,895 breeding pairs in European Russia), in Kazakhstan there are an estimated 22,000–31,000 pairs (I. Karyakin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The largest numbers are found within the Russian Federation: Republic of Kalmykia – 194 known breeding territories with an estimated 500-700 breeding pairs; Volgograd district – 50 known breeding pairs, estimated 300–500 breeding pairs; Orenburd district – 139 known breeding pairs, estimated 200–350 breeding pairs; Republic of Altai – 301 known breeding pairs, estimated 400–600 breeding pairs; Republic of Tyva – 140 known breeding pairs, estimated 300–400 breeding pairs (I.

Karyakin&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Migration studies observed 572 Steppe Eagles leaving the Tibetan plateau and heading to wintering grounds (possibly in the Middle East or Africa) in 2012, with a maximum observance of 1,102 individuals in 2013 and 6,166 individuals in 2014 at Thoolakharka, Nepal (Subedi 2014). More recently, 4,900 individuals were observed at a dump sites northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2019 (Keijmel 2019).

Reduction in discards has greatly reduced available food in parts of the species range that had seen rapid increases in the previous century. Further, trophic shifts have impacted fishing activity and catch size, which appears to be directly related to colony reproductive success: lower catches are resulting in lower breeding success and the decline of colonies in the UK (Foster <em>et al.</em> 2017).
