This species may only survive at all because the known localities lie within forest monasteries, but these are not considered secure from this disturbance.","This species is confined to rocky outcrops within heavily disturbed wet forest, the only remaining form of forest in this area. Both surviving localities are within forest monasteries.","The habitat of this species is threatened by human activities including logging and expanding agriculture (pineapple plantations). The growing human population may increase pressure on this species' habitat. Granite quarrying may destroy the outcrops in which it survives. The known localities are forest monasteries and this may have informally preserved the geckos, however, there has been a recent increase in wedding photography at these sites and the frequent use of high-intensity artificial lights is likely to disturb this species. Any change in habitat use in this areas or expansion or development of the monasteries is likely to result in its immediate extinction. Air pollution may impact this species, given its occurrence close to a major urban area, but there is no information on any impacts.","This species was described in 1885, with no holotype. Manamendra-Arachchi (2007) designated a lectotype, collected in 1871, and until recently this was the only known specimen, suggesting that the species could be extinct. Six specimens were found alive 150 years later in 2016, across both newly discovered (closely adjacent) localities. Subsequent visits have found that it does not appear to be rare at these localities (S. Karunarathna pers. comm. 2019). The population presently appears to be stable where habitat remains, but it is estimated that suitable habitat - already fragmented and restricted by urban expansion - has declined by 80% over the past 15 years based on an examination of Google Earth satellite data (D.

In Iraq, encompassing the majority of its range, the species probably qualifies globally as Endangered, EN A4c.","<p><em>Rafetus euphraticus</em> is almost exclusively riverine, inhabiting&#160;various freshwater habitats,&#160;preferably permanent and temporary tributaries and oxbow lakes, as well as slow-flowing sections of the main river channel (Gramentz 1991, Taskavak and Atatur 1998, Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2014, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is particularly thermophilic (Taskavak and Atatur 1998).&#160;<em>Rafetus euphraticus</em> feeds mainly on&#160;crabs, insects, and&#160;fish, but also scavenges and takes some vegetable material (Taskavak and Atatur 1998, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). Nests are placed in sandy riverbanks close to the waterline.&#160;The nesting season in Iran extends from late April to early June, with mating observed in March; hatchlings emerge from their nest in early July (Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2013, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;Reported clutch sizes average 30â40 eggs (Taskavak and Atatur 1998, Baran and Atatur 1998, Biricik and Tugra 2011, Ghaffari <em>et al.</em> 2013, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016), but there is no information on clutch frequency, age or size at maturity, or generation time. Eggs are spherical in shape and 29.5 mm in diameter and the average weight is 13.6 g (Biricik and TuÄra 2011); the mean size of hatchlings is 41.5 mm and the mean weight 10.8 g (Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Maximum size is 68 cm carapace length and generation time is estimated at about 15 yrs.</p><p></p>","Anthropogenic fragmentation, alteration, and destruction of suitable habitat <span class=""s1"">throughout its range are the main threats to <em>Rafetus euphraticus </em>(Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;Major dams cause fundamental changes to water quality and the flow regime downstream, making it impossible for <em>R. euphraticus</em> to survive in long downstream riverine stretches. The loss of sandbank nesting habitat through flooding and sand mining is also a serious threat (Gramentz 1991, 1993b; Taskavak and Atatur 1998;&#160;Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;The use of pesticides in agricultural fields next to riverbanks causes pollution along the tributaries (Ayaz and BayrakÃ§Ä± 2015).&#160;The draining of the&#160;Mesopotamian&#160;Marshes in southeastern coastal Iraq and southwestern Iran after the 1991 Gulf War is likely to have impacted Iraqi populations significantly.&#160;Animals accidentally caught by fishermen may be killed as perceived competitors, and nests destroyed (Taskavak and Atatur 1998, Baran and Atatur 1998, Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2014, Mobaraki in litt.).&#160;Animals are occasionally consumed;&#160;in Iran the turtles are not consumed by locals but it is reported that Chinese employees of the National Iranian Oil Company consume turtles in Hawr-al-Azim marshland along the border of Iraq (Taskavak and Reimann 1998, Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2014, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Iraq, various wars and political conflicts, drought, dam construction, unsustainable fishing methods, especially electro-fishing, and the use of poisons and explosive materials are the main concerns for <em>Rafetus </em>survival. Furthermore, oil development, especially in southern Iraq and gravel mining in northern rivers threatens <em>R. euphraticus </em>populations (Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). No information is available on threats to <em>R. euphraticus </em>in Syria, where it occupies territories under severe political unrest and turmoil&#160;(Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016).

The species is declining in Turkey because of dams and sand quarries. A total of 17 individuals in 14 different habitats were observed in 30 days in Turkish tributaries of the Euphrates; no individuals were observed along the main arm of the Euphrates, since no suitable habitats were left for nesting or basking, indicating a strong reduction in the previously observed population there (Ayaz and BayrakÃ§Ä± 2015).

3292503,11534,Lepidochelys olivacea,Vulnerable,A2bd,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Assessment procedure</span><br/>In accordance with the IUCN guidelines for Red List Assessments, the focus of this evaluation has been the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001). For Olive Ridleys, as with other sea turtle species, as it is not possible to survey mature individuals we used an index of abundance in the form of the number of annual nesting females. Although not all females breed every year (see section on Reproduction below) and males are not evaluated, this index is considered to be the most reliable estimator for long-term population trends of marine turtles since the proportion of the total number of females that nest in any given year and the sex ratio is believed to be fairly constant across time within and between subpopulations (Meylan 1982, Limpus 1996).<br/><br/>Direct counts of the number of nesting females (NF) are not always available so we also relied on alternative information that can be converted to NF: number of nests per season, nests/km/yr or number of protected nests per season; annual estimates of hatchling or egg production, or census estimates of nesting females from arribada rookeries. When these proxies were used, the counted units were converted to NF based on the following constants: 105 eggs/nest and 2.5 nests/season/female. Some conservation programs reported annual number of protected nests but did not include the quantity of poached or otherwise destroyed or predated nests. For these cases we extrapolated to the total number of nests based on local estimates of conservation efficiency. All conversions to NF were made under the assumptions that (a) the mean number of eggs/nest and the number of nests/female/season do not differ significantly over the timescales we have used; and (b) the effort and the coverage of the biological parameters we used are reasonably constant through the time frame evaluated. In cases where the different surveys involved different levels of coverage, explicit corrections were made and specified in the result tables.<br/><br/>In spite of the Olive Ridley being the most abundant sea turtle, available quantitative information is extremely scarce and unevenly distributed across regions. We thus relied on a subset of the worldâs rookeries which, we assume, exhibit population trends that are representative of the population as a whole or, at least, for each of the regions. We selected 28 Index Sites (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below) for which reasonably long time series of quantitative data are available. They include all the largest known populations, as well as an assortment of smaller rookeries from almost all of the regions where the species is found. All sites are assumed to be demographically independent. However, although genetic data indicate a high degree of inter-rookery migration between some rookeries (e.g., Brazil-Suriname- Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (1998); between MÃ©xico to Central America in the Eastern Pacific- BriseÃ±o-DueÃ±as (1998)) the results reflect events within an evolutionary timescale (many generations). Within the time span relevant to the assessment (two to three generations), available evidence suggests significant demographic independence between the pairs of rookeries in question (e.g., mark-recapture in Nancite and Ostional indicate the vast majority are different turtles- reviewed by Bernardo and Plotkin (2007); absence of exchange by tagged turtles and non-overlapping nesting seasons Brazil vs Suriname/French Guiana- de Silva et al. (in press); and the lack of re-colonization of depleted arribadas in Jalisco and Guerrero in MÃ©xico by the very large Escobilla rookery, 500 to 1,000 km distant in over four decades).<br/><br/>The population abundance estimates were based on raw data or on extrapolations from regressions performed on available data. As the relatively data-rich trends consistently indicated exponential trajectories we relied on these as the method of choice for extrapolations. Some data sets contained a number of trajectories across the time frames employed and in these more than one regression was employed or a combination of regressions and raw data. We have constrained our back extrapolations to time spans close to known historical events that are believed to have defined major abundance changes in order to avoid gross exaggerations with no supporting evidence. This has, however, meant that in some cases the extrapolations have only been performed back two generations (40 years) and could be considered underestimates of decline.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the assessment process</span><br/>Calculations based on very different datasets obtained by different workgroups, using multiple survey methods and spanning many decades are fraught with uncertainties. A number of these could be biasing our assessment. (1) Combining abundance information for individual rookeries obtained with a number of different methodologies could provide a source of error. However, we believe that the magnitude of these errors is of minor significance to the final declines estimated. (2) Because of the assessmentâs requirement for quantitative information, a very small proportion of the total known rookeries were included, and some regions are not well represented. The bias this introduces is further augmented since it is most likely that rookeries having long time series of data are also the most monitored and hence the better protected. In this case the estimates of decline will be underestimated relative to the true trends for the more numerous and less well monitored/protected rookeries. This is likely the case for regions with little (Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean) or no (entire Eastern Atlantic) representation in our assessment that contribute very little to our global decline values yet where reports with qualitative evidence indicate extensive population declines (reviewed by Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Nonetheless, although ideally a global assessment should incorporate full data from all regions to derive robust evaluations, the available information on the geographic distribution of abundances suggests that the largest rookeries are concentrated in regions with good representation and thus their inclusion will not significantly affect the global results. This is reflected at the regional level and in results for non-arribada rookeries where our sample bias will probably have caused an underestimation of true decline levels. (3) The extent of extrapolations into time past is an aspect that will undoubtedly contribute to the uncertainty of the results, particularly with scarce information. We have avoided extrapolating far beyond the oldest datasets to avoid this type of errors and thus consider that our results are conservative.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Rationale for the Red List Assessment</span>:<br/>In spite of scarcity in historical data, information from diverse sources has made it possible to evaluate a global decline for this widely distributed species over time periods ranging from decades to 2-3 generations. Striking regional differences are observed in the estimations that undoubtedly indicate far lower survival probabilities in some of the regions than what the global results would suggest.<br/><br/>There was also a stark and recurring contrast between the decline estimates for subpopulations grouped according to breeding strategy- arribada or non-arribada (solitary). The global decline rate estimated from non-arribada subpopulations (-63 to -83%) reflects a widespread low conservation status for these types of subpopulations that suggests they havenât recovered to historical (pre 1960) levels even in regions with long-term protection programs (e.g., over four decades in MÃ©xico) in spite generalized increments over the last decade (MÃ¡rquez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). This needs to be highlighted because rookeries with non-arribada behavior are many times more numerous than those that nest as arribadas (e.g., in MÃ©xico about 98% of Olive Ridley subpopulations are non-arribada). Yet, as their abundances are up to three to four orders of magnitude smaller than arribada rookeries, they have an insignificant influence on the global decline estimates. In fact, the global net decline for the Olive Ridley is driven principally by population trends in just two arribada populations, Escobilla (MÃ©xico) and Ostional (Costa Rica), both in the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>The global decline value estimated on the basis of estimated population reductions of the annual number of Olive Ridley nesting females at subpopulations in the Index Sites used ranged between 31 and 36% (see Table 3 in the Supplementary Material, see below). As most of the back extrapolations were limited to two generations it is likely that this value is conservative.<br/><br/>When deciding whether to apply Red List decline criterion A1 (the causes of reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased) or A2 (the causes of reduction may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible) to obtain decline thresholds for the listing process three characteristics of the speciesâ decline need to be analyzed (SPWG 2006): (1) is the reduction reversible?, (2) are the causes of the reduction identified and understood?, and (3) have the threatening factors ceased? Since the decline estimated is driven by result from arribada rookeries, the questions need to be addressed against what is known for these types of populations. While it would appear that the elimination of large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley for leather and local consumption has allowed for the stabilization of a significant portion of rookeries, particularly in the Eastern Pacific and in particular facilitated the growth of arribada rookeries such as Escobilla and Ostional, the population growth of Mismaloya, Tlalcoyunque and Chacahua in the same region and under similar conservation circumstances remain at reduced abundances well below an arribada category. This could indicate that under some circumstances, the reduction of arribada rookeries below a certain level can make it impossible or unlikely for it to recover an arribada behavior. The major cause for the reduction in the species is thought to have been the massive commercial over-exploitations, particularly in the Eastern Pacific. Furthermore, we do not yet fully understand nor are able to manage other stressors, some intrinsic or at least due to interactions between the overcrowding of growing populations that equally provoke dramatic declines in arribadas such as that of Nancite in spite of decades of protection (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Though commercial exploitation of Olive Ridleys for international markets has effectively been eliminated, at local levels significant factors continue to impact individual rookeries such as excessive egg exploitation (e.g., Isla CaÃ±a, Panama) or bycatch (such as in Orissa, India). These examples indicate that Olive Ridleys, under current circumstances, do not meet all of the conditions for A1 and hence should be evaluated under criterion A2.<br/><br/>Under A2, the decline estimations obtained for the Olive Ridley Turtle at a global scale correspond to the Vulnerable IUCN Red List threshold (a decline of &gt;30% but &lt;50%.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Like most other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys display a complex life cycle, which requires a range of geographically separated localities and multiple habitats (MÃ¡rquez 1990). Females lay their nests on coastal sandy beaches from which neonates emerge and enter the marine environment to continue their development. They remain in a pelagic phase, drifting passively with major currents that disperse far from their natal sites, with juveniles sharing some of the adultsâ habitats (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000) until sexual maturity is reached (Musick and Limpus 1997). Reproductively active males and females migrate toward coastal zones and concentrate near nesting beaches. However, some males appear to remain in oceanic waters and mate with females en route to their nesting beaches (Plotkin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). Their post-breeding migrations are complex, with pathways varying annually (Plotkin 1994) and with no apparent migratory corridors, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometers over large ocean expanses (Morreale <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), commonly within the 20Â°C isotherms (MÃ¡rquez 1990). In the East Pacific, they are present from 30Â°N to 15Â°S and often seen within 1,200 nautical miles from shore although they have been sighted as far as 140Â°W (IATTC 2004). Western Atlantic Olive Ridleys appear to remain in neritic waters after breeding (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Demographic features / Reproduction</span><br/>The species displays three modes of reproduction: arribada, dispersed nesting, and mixed strategy (Bernardo and Plotkin 2007). The first mode represents a synchronous, mass nesting behaviour that may include hundreds to thousands of females over a period of days and occurs in fewer than a dozen places worldwide. The more common form of nesting is dispersed or âsolitaryâ with no apparent synchronicity between individual events. At some localities, a mixture of these two forms of nesting can also occur. In general, individual Olive Ridleys may nest one, two or three times per season, with approximately 100â110 eggs per clutch (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995). For this assessment we have used an average number of 2.5 nests/female/season and 105 eggs/nest. In contrast to other sea turtle species, the reproductive cycle is nearly annual (over 60% of turtles nest every year; MÃ¡rquez 1990). Solitary nesters oviposit on 14 day cycles whereas arribada nesters approximately every 28 days (Pritchard 1969, Kalb and Owens 1994, Kalb 1999). Kalb (1999) found that within a nesting season solitary nesters use multiple beaches for oviposition but arribada nesters display nest site fidelity. There are extreme variations in hatching rates between nesting beaches, however, in general they are much higher in solitary nesting beaches where around 80% is common and sometimes even higher (Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). It is widely recognized that survivorship is extremely low on high-density arribada nesting beaches because of density-dependent mortality (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991) leading to hatching rates as low as 1 to 8% (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Moreover, turtles return approximately every month during a discrete nesting season (three to six months) and nests that remained intact during the previous month are again at risk when new waves of turtles crawl ashore. On solitary nesting beaches, where density-dependent mortality is not a factor, hatching rates are significantly higher (Castro 1986, Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Post-hatching survivorship is unknown and there is no information available on recruitment rates. Presumably, like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys experience high mortality in their early life stages. Juveniles are believed to occur in similar habitats as the adults (i.e,. pelagic waters) where they forage on gelatinous prey such as jellyfish, salps and tunicates (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).","Like other long-lived species, Olive Ridleys are prone to population declines because of slow intrinsic growth rate in combination with anthropogenic impacts. These can accumulate over a protracted development through various life stages, multiple habitats (nesting beaches, migratory routes and pelagic foraging zones) and vast geographic expanses.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Targeted exploitation</span><br/>Egg harvest. Olive Ridleys and their eggs have been harvested, mostly unsustainably, worldwide. However, the current impact is difficult to evaluate because of other simultaneous factors such as incidental take in commercial fisheries. Nonetheless, there is documentation of recent egg use causing declines (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). From MÃ©xico to Colombia, Olive Ridley eggs have been and still are used for personal and commercial use (Lagueux 1989, Arauz 2000, Campbell 2007, Cornelius et al. 2007). Laws regulating turtle egg use vary among countries, and even where laws prohibit egg use, illegal use of Olive Ridley eggs is believed to be widespread because enforcement is either non-existent or insufficient. On unprotected solitary nesting beaches (most are unprotected), egg extraction often approaches 100%. Human use of turtle eggs for consumption and domestic animal consumption historically was widespread in the Indian Ocean and continues today largely wherever Ridleys nest (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Egg use has been reported in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Pakistan and Malaysia and is believed to have caused the decline of Olive Ridleys in these countries (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Even at monitored beaches a proportion of the eggs are still lost to poaching.<br/><br/>Directed take of adults. In the East Pacific, although Olive Ridley turtle fisheries are now closed, illegal take of adult turtles still occurs widely with an unknown level of impact. There is evidence that thousands of Olive Ridleys are still taken each year along the Pacific coast of MÃ©xico (Frazier et al. 2007). In the West Atlantic, the direct take of adults has diminished over time to negligible levels (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). In the Indian Ocean, the use of adult Olive Ridleys and their eggs for personal use has been and continues to be widespread (Frazier 1982, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), and market-driven harvesting of eggs and females from nesting beaches are considered the greatest threat (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Personal, subsistence use of adult Olive Ridley turtles is widespread worldwide (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Olive Ridleys and/or their eggs are used along the entire coast of West Africa (including Macaronesia) and sold in local and regional markets (Fretey 2001).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bycatch in fisheries</span><br/>The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys occurs worldwide in trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seines, gill net and other net fisheries and hook and line fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The impact of the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in fisheries has been well documented for some regions but not for others. In some locations where by-catch statistics are unavailable from fisheries, cause and effect has been used to implicate a fishery in the decline of Olive Ridleys. The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in the shrimp trawl fishery in the western Atlantic, is believed to be the main cause of the significant population decline observed there since the 1970s and currently the number of Olive Ridleys by caught in trawl fisheries off the coasts of Surinam and French Guiana is believed to be approximately a couple of thousand turtles annually (Godfrey and Chevalier 2004, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Gillnets and other fishing methods in this region also capture Olive Ridleys incidentally but to a lesser extent than shrimp trawl fishery (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Bycatch in trawl fisheries off Sergipe State in Brazil is considered the most pressing threat to that population (ThomÃ© <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the eastern Atlantic, the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys by commercial fisheries is thought to be a significant threat but very little systematic data is available (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental mortality of Olive Ridleys is worst along the coast of Orissa, India with arribada Olive Ridleys gathering to nest were fishing effort is high. Every year since the early 1980s, thousands or tens of thousands of Olive Ridleys have stranded dead on the Orissa beaches, presumably as a result of incidental capture in shrimp trawls (Pandav 2000). A gill net fishery also operates in the region and contributes to the ridley mortality along this coastline. Incidental capture in fisheries is also believed to be a serious threat in the eastern Pacific (Frazier et al. 2007) where Olive Ridleys aggregate in large numbers off shore from nesting beaches (Kalb <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Kalb 1999), but the information available is incomplete (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995, NMFS/USFWS 1998). Incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in this region has been documented in shrimp trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seine fishery and gill net fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a serious threat along the coast of Central America, with an estimated annual capture for all species of marine turtle exceeding 60,000 turtles, most of which are Olive Ridleys (Arauz 1996). Recent growth in the longline fisheries of this region are also a serious and growing threat to Olive Ridleys and have the potential to capture hundreds of thousands of Ridleys annually (Frazier et al., 2007). Bycatch of Olive Ridleys is high in Indonesian tuna long-lines and shrimp trawls although mortality appears to be low (WWF Indonesia, unpublished data).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitat impacts</span><br/>Degradation, transformation and destruction of natural conditions at nesting beaches from coastal developments continue to threaten the long-term survival of many Olive Ridley rookeries. Transformation of nesting habitat comes from the construction of new aquaculture ponds, fishing harbours and tourist facilities, as well as growth of existing coastal villages which are increasing in many parts of the world within the range of the Olive Ridley, particularly along the east coast of India (Pandav and Choudhury 1999) and in some zones in coastal MÃ©xico to Central America (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). These impacts contribute stress directly through the loss of nesting habitat or indirectly through changes in the thermal profiles of the beach, increased light pollution (Witherington 1992) and sewage effluents.<br/><br/>Global warming has the potential to impact the habitats and ecosystems of Olive Ridley populations worldwide (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Weishampal 2004) but the specific impacts are purely speculative at this time. Most accounts have focused on the impact of global warming on incubation temperatures of eggs, which influence the sex ratio of the embryos (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Diseases and predation</span><br/>Extremely little is known about diseases and their effects on Olive Ridley abundance. The only disease identified in the literature for Olive Ridleys is fibropapilloma, a herpes-virus found in sea turtles nearly worldwide (Herbst 1994). The incidence of fibropapilloma is not believed to be high in Olive Ridleys but has been observed in Olive Ridleys nesting in Costa Rica (Herbst 1994) and in MÃ©xico (Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). At some individual rookeries, the predation by wild pigs and/or feral dogs can be substantial (e.g., in the Andaman Islands; Andrews et al. 2001). Infestation of developing eggs by fly and beetle larvae can cause significant mortality of embryos. In an extremely worrying case, the beetle larvae (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Omorgus suberosus fabricius</span>) has become a plague in the worldâs largest arribada rookery in Escobilla, MÃ©xico where it is provoking steep drops in the hatching efficiency of the clutches laid, from a typical 30% for this colony (MÃ¡rquez 1990) to less than 5% in some areas (LÃ³pez-Reyes and Harfush 2000). When combined with the relatively low hatching rates of high-density arribada beaches and the destruction of eggs laid by previous nesters, this problem could provoke the rookeryâs decline.","<p>For the purposes of Red List assessments, generation length is defined as the âaverage age of parentsâ (IUCN 2001). Since this information is not available from direct observation of sea turtle species we derived a comparable value from estimates of age at which 50% of the breeders are expected to have survived, using information for age at sexual maturity and adult survival rates. An important caveat is that, while it is known that different populations of the same species can attain sexual maturity at different ages (Heppell <em>et al.</em> 2003) and therefore different values would need to be taken into account for different regions, the information is only available for a single region and we have had to assume the estimated values are generally applicable on a global scale. The only published study on growth and age for Olive Ridleys (Zug <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates a mean age at sexual maturity for North-central Pacific Ridley sea turtles of around 13 years (range of 10-18 years). We calculated the time it would take for a cohort of breeders to reach 50% of its original size from S<sup>n</sup> =50%, where <span times="""" new="""" roman="""">n is years since age at first reproduction, and S is annual survival. Solving for n, n = ln(0.5)/ln(S). As extensive estimates of annual survival rates for female nesters are only available from the better studied sister taxon, <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em>, (TEWG 2000) we used these, which have a range of 85-92% per year. Thus, n<sub>50% </sub>= 4-9 yrs and our derived average age of female Olive Ridley parents is 17-22 years. We additionally assumed that this value would be the same for male parents. For simplicity, we have used a value of 20 yrs for the speciesâ generation length in this assessment.</p>",Decreasing,"The Olive Ridley sea turtle has a circumtropical distribution, with nesting occurring throughout tropical waters (except the Gulf of Mexico) and migratory circuits in tropical and some subtropical areas (Atlantic Ocean â eastern central, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, western central; Indian Ocean â eastern, western; Pacific Ocean â eastern central, northwest, southwest, western central) (Pritchard 1969). Nesting occurs in nearly 60 countries worldwide. Migratory movements are less well studied than other marine turtle species but are known to involve coastal waters of over 80 countries (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below). With very few exceptions they are not known to move between ocean basins or to cross from one ocean border to the other. Within a region, Olive Ridleys may move between the oceanic and neritic zones (Plotkin <em>et al.</em> 1995, Shanker <em>et al</em>. 2003) or just occupy neritic waters (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Most of the conservation actions on behalf of the Olive Ridley at national and international levels have been based on the speciesâ listing under the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Endangered </span>category in the IUCN Red List. As an Appendix I species under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) the international trade of skins from the species, which fuelled the large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley from the 1960s into the 1980s was effectively halted. Other relevant international instruments that list the Olive Ridley as threatened and hence obligate its conservation by member states include: the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC). CMS-promoted Memoranda of Understanding for the conservation and management of marine turtles and their habitats have been signed by the Olive Ridleyâs range states in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (known as IOSEA) as well as in other regions such as the Atlantic Coast of Africa under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa where 21 out of 26 range states participate.<br/><br/>On the basis of the speciesâ classification in the IUCN Red List or in national endangered species lists, local legislatures of range states confer protection to the Olive Ridley. Although this sanctions law-enforcement, the implementation remains patchy at the global scale because of paucity in enforcement capabilities. Successful conservation has usually relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local and non-governmental organizations incorporating public outreach. Statutory use and enforcement of the Turtle Excluder Devices in the shrimp trawlers has also proven critical in some areas with high levels of interaction with this fishery.<br/><br/>Despite the legislative efforts to protect the Olive Ridley, human impacts continue to be significant. In some areas (such as West Africa and South East Asia), extensive monitoring needs to be implemented to identify regions and stressors requiring priority actions. Bycatch and illegal take particularly from the coastal, artisanal fisheries need to be evaluated through adequate on-board observer programs and properly addressed. The beetle infestation of the Escobilla rookery must be adequately evaluated and acceptable measures of biological control of the insect need to be implemented. The impact from the increasing development of much of the range stateâs coastline has to be evaluated and suitable mitigation measures implemented.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

When ambient water temperatures drop below 20Â°C (68Â°F) in autumn and winter, manatees aggregate at natural and artificial warm-water refuges or move to southern Florida (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001, Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Most artificial refuges are created by warm-water outfalls from power plants. The largest winter aggregations (maximum count of 100 or more animals) are at refuges in central and southern Florida. The northernmost natural warm-water refuges used regularly by manatees are at Crystal River on the west coast and at Blue Spring in the St. Johns River on the east coast. Most manatees return to the same warm-water refuges each year; however, some use different refuges in different years and others use two or more refuges in the same winter (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, Deutsch 2000, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Many minor aggregation sites are used as temporary thermal refuges. Most of these refuges are deeper canals or boat basins where warmer water temperatures persist as temperatures in adjacent bays and rivers decline. Manatees using thermal refuges move to nearby grassbeds to feed (generally within 30 km), and may even return to a more distant warm season range during mild periods in mid-winter (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>As water temperatures rise manatees disperse from winter aggregation areas. While some remain near their winter refuges, most undertake extensive travels along the coast and some move far up rivers and canals. On the east coast, summer sightings drop off rapidly north of Georgia (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001) and are rare north of Cape Hatteras (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1982, Schwartz 1995); the northernmost published sighting is from Rhode Island (Reid 1996, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). On the west coast, sightings drop off sharply west of the Suwannee River in Florida (Marine Mammal Commission 1986), although a small number of manatees are seen each summer in the Wakulla River at the base of the Florida Panhandle. Rare sightings also have been made in the Dry Tortugas (Reynolds and Ferguson 1984) and the Bahamas (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001; Odell <em>et al</em>. 1978; Reid 2000, 2001). As in winter, manatees show strong site fidelity to the same summer habitats year after year (Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, Koelsch 1997, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>In recent years, the most important spring habitat along the east coast of Florida has been the northern Banana River and Indian River Lagoon and their associated waters in Brevard County; more than 300 to 500 manatees have been counted in this area shortly before dispersing in late spring (Provancha and Provancha 1988, FWC unpubl.). A comparable spring aggregation area does not appear to exist on the west coast, although Charlotte Harbor was visited in the spring by almost half of the 35 manatees radio-tagged at the Fort Myers power plant in Lee County (Lefebvre and Frohlich 1986). During summer, manatees may be commonly found almost anywhere in Florida where water depths and access channels are greater than 1 m (OâShea 1988). Manatees can be found in very shallow water. Hartman (1979) observed manatees utilizing waters as shallow as 0.4 m with their backs out of the water. In warm seasons they usually occur alone or in pairs, although interacting groups of five to ten animals are not unusual.<br/><br/>Migration corridors and responses by individual animals have been elaborated by long-term telemetry studies (Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Scientists have demonstrated site-fidelity in manatees, but have also noted that individual animals adjust their behaviours to take advantage of protected areas or changes in availability of resources. For example, Buckingham <em>et al</em>. (1999) confirmed increased manatee use of selected sanctuary areas during times when surrounding disturbance by boats was high.<br/><br/>Shallow grass beds with ready access to deep channels are preferred feeding areas in coastal and riverine habitats. Manatees often use secluded canals, creeks, embayments, and lagoons, particularly near the mouths of coastal rivers and sloughs, for feeding, resting, cavorting, mating, and calving. In estuarine and brackish areas, natural and artificial fresh water sources are sought by manatees.  Although manatees can tolerate a wide range of salinities (Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 1998), they prefer habitats where osmotic stress is minimal or where fresh water is periodically available (OâShea and Kochman 1990). Ortiz <em>et al</em>. (1998) report that âmanatees may be susceptible to dehydration after an extended period if freshwater is not availableâ.<br/><br/>Manatees are herbivores that feed opportunistically on a wide variety of submerged, floating, and emergent vegetation. Because of their broad distribution and migratory patterns, Florida manatees utilize a wider diversity of food items and are possibly less specialized in their feeding strategies than manatees in tropical regions (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). Seagrasses appear to be a staple of the manatee diet in coastal areas (Smith 1990, Provancha and Hall 1991, Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). Packard (1984) noted two feeding methods in coastal seagrass beds: (1) rooting, where virtually the entire plant is consumed; and (2) grazing, where exposed grass blades are eaten without disturbing the roots or sediment. Manatees may return to specific seagrass beds to graze on new growth (Koelsch 1997, Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the upper Banana River, Provancha and Hall (1991) found spring concentrations of manatees grazing in beds dominated by manatee grass (<em>Syringodium filiforme</em>). They also reported an apparent preference for manatee grass and shoalgrass (<em>Halodule wrightii</em>) over the macroalga <em>Caulerpa</em> spp. Along the Florida-Georgia border, manatees feed in salt marshes on smooth cordgrass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>) by timing feeding periods with high tide (Baugh <em>et al</em>. 1989, Zoodsma 1991).<br/><br/>Breeding takes place when one or more males (ranging from 5 to 22) are attracted to an oestrous female to form an ephemeral mating herd (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Mating herds can last up to four weeks, with different males joining and leaving the herd daily (Hartman 1979, Bengtson 1981, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Permanent bonds between males and females do not form. During peak activity, the males in mating herds compete intensely for access to the female (Hartman 1979). Successive copulations involving different males have been reported. Some observations suggest that larger, presumably older, males dominate access to females early in the formation of mating herds and are responsible for most pregnancies (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995), but males as young as three years old are spermatogenic (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995). Although breeding has been reported in all seasons, Hernandez <em>et al</em>. (1995) reported that histological studies of reproductive organs from carcasses of males found evidence of sperm production in 94% of adult males recovered from March through November. Only 20% of adult males recovered from December through February showed similar production.<br/><br/>Females appear to reach sexual maturity by about age five but have given birth as early as four (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, OâShea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995), and males may reach sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years of age (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995). Manatees may live in excess of 50 years (Marmontel 1995), and evidence for reproductive senescence is unclear (Marmontel 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Wild females have been documented continuing to calve into their late 30s (USGS-Sirenia, unpubl.), and a captive animal gave birth in her mid-40s (FWS, unpubl.). The length of the gestation period is uncertain but is thought to be between 11 and 14 months (Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). The normal litter size is one, with twins reported rarely (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, OâShea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Calf dependency usually lasts one to two years after birth (Hartman 1979, OâShea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). Calving intervals average about 2.5 years (when the calf survives to weaning), but they vary greatly among individuals and may be considerably longer depending on age and perhaps other factors (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). Females that abort or lose a calf due to perinatal death may become pregnant again within a few months (Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995), or even weeks (Hartman 1979).<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>The habitat and ecology of the Antillean manatee is thought to be similar to its sister subspecies. However, given that the Florida manatee inhabits the most northern extent of the species range, behaviour and life history characteristics may be dissimilar in this tropical subspecies. Antillean manatees use rivers, lakes, coastal and inland lagoons, and coastal marine environments, including seagrass, mangrove, and coral reef ecosystems. Although they are able to survive in fresh, estuarine, or marine environments for extended periods of time, several lines of evidence indicate a dependence on periodic access to fresh water for osmoregulation (Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 1998, 1999; Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001; Reid <em>et al</em>. 2003). As herbivores, access to aquatic vegetation is necessary for survival; seagrasses (<em>Thalassia, Halodule, Halophila</em> and <em>Syringodium</em>) appear to be favored in estuarine and marine areas. Osmoregulation and thermoregulation are behaviorally controlled by movements between activity centers. Quiet protected areas are necessary for resting and for cows with young calves; connections (travel corridors) between feeding, drinking, nursery, mating, and resting areas are very important. A discussion of the environmental factors influencing seasonal movements and migratory behavior in both subspecies is provided in Deutsch <em>et al</em>. (2003).","<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>Threats to the Florida manatee encompass catastrophic natural events and anthropogenic factors that could cause declines in reproductive and survival rates or declines in the carrying capacity of the environment. Much of the following text is modified from the Biological Status Reviews for the Florida manatee (FWC 2002, Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Anthropogenic Threats</strong><br/>About half of adult mortality rangewide is attributable to human-related causes, primarily watercraft collisions (Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2002). This is significant because the manatee population growth rate is highly sensitive to changes in adult survival rate (Eberhardt and OâShea 1995, Marmontel <em>et al</em>. 1997, Runge <em>et al</em>. 2004). The future of the Florida manatee is also jeopardized by the predicted loss and deterioration of warm-water habitat, including retirement or deregulation of aging power plants and reduction in natural spring flows.<br/><br/>Watercraft collisions:  Watercraft collisions account for approximately 25% of all manatee deaths and 35% of documented deaths of known cause, and are the single greatest cause of human-related mortality (Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995, FWC-FWRI unpubl.). In 2005, there were over one million registered vessels in Florida (FHSMV, http://casey.hsmv.state.fl.us/Intranet/dmv/TaxCollDocs/vesselstats2005.pdf), and many more out-of-state boaters visit Florida annually. The number of registered vessels in Florida has increased by an average of 2.9% per year over the past 25 years, doubling since 1980 (FWC, unpubl.). Given that about 97% of registrations are for recreational watercraft (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995), it can be expected that there will be a continued increase in recreational vessels plying the waterways of Florida with a concomitant increase in the human population. In addition to the expected increase in boat numbers over the coming century, there are other factors that may act synergistically to increase the risk of collisions between manatees and watercraft. Modifications to the design of vessel hulls and engines are allowing boats to travel at higher speeds in shallower waters (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995), thus threatening manatees and scarring seagrass beds. Boater compliance with existing slow speed zones is inconsistent (Gorzelany 1998, Shapiro 2001). <br/><br/>Sub-lethal effects on manatees of increased vessel traffic and a growing human population in the coastal zone are cause for concern.  Most adult manatee carcasses bear scars from previous boat strikes and the healed, skeletal fractures of some indicate that they had survived previous traumatic impacts (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995, Lightsey <em>et al</em>. 2006). Of over 1,000 living individuals in the manatee photo-identification database (Beck and Reid 1995), 97% had scar patterns from multiple boat strikes (OâShea <em>et al</em>. 2001). Approximately one-third of these individuals were severely mutilated, especially on the tail and the dorsum. It should be noted that the photo-identification database contains only animals with scars or other identifiable features. Non-lethal injuries may reduce the breeding success of wounded females and may permanently remove some animals from the breeding population (OâShea 1995, Reynolds 1999). Vessel traffic and recreational activities that disturb manatees may cause them to leave preferred habitats and may alter biologically important behaviours such as feeding, suckling, or resting (OâShea 1995, Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Loss of Warm-water Habitat:  Expected changes in the network of warm-water refuges over the next several decades present the most serious long-term threat to manatees in Florida, as noted in the federal Recovery Plan: âone of the greatest threats to the continued existence of the Florida manatee is the stability and longevity of warm-water refugesâ (USFWS 2001, p. 28). Ultimately, the discharges from power plants provide unreliable warm-water habitat when viewed over the long term (i.e., next 20 to 100 years) because the once-through cooling technology that creates the large thermal plumes is being replaced by more efficient and alternative cooling technologies (Laist and Reynolds 2005a). Short-term threats to the network of warm-water sites also loom on the immediate horizon.  Some aging power plants may be shut down and potential deregulation of the electric utility industry may eliminate or reduce the reliability of warm-water effluents that large numbers of manatees depend on to survive winter cold periods (Rose 1997, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2000). Temporary disruptions in heated effluents during winter have caused changes in local manatee distribution (Packard <em>et al</em>. 1989) and have been implicated in elevated numbers of deaths from cold stress (Campbell and Irvine 1981, Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995). The complete elimination of a secondary warm-water refuge in northeastern Florida through diffusion of the heated effluent resulted in a shift in manatee distribution within the area and in substantial mortality of manatees that remained in the region (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2000, Laist and Reynolds 2005a). Loss of certain key warm-water sites could result in catastrophic mortality and would likely reduce the environmental carrying capacity for manatees in Florida. <br/><br/>The long-term reliability of artesian springs that provide natural warm-water refuges for manatees is also in doubt because human demand for ground water and loss of recharge areas through development will likely result in diminished spring flows (Reynolds 2000, Laist and Reynolds 2005a). According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2001), Floridaâs human population increased by about 23% to 16 million between 1990 and 2000, and projections suggest that the number of people living in Florida will increase by another 10 million people by 2025. In order to meet the increased demand for water that a growth in human population will entail, it is likely that spring flows and water quality will decline, further reducing natural warm-water habitat for manatees. This natural habitat will become even more important in the future as existing industrial sites disappear.<br/><br/>Other Direct Threats to Manatees from Human Activities: Other threats from human activities include entanglement (in fishing gear or debris), entrapment in water-control structures and pipes, exposure to contaminants, incidental ingestion of debris, and crushing (in flood-control structures, in canal locks, or between large ships and docks) (Beck and Barros 1991, Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995). Indirect effects from increased vessel traffic include increased water turbidity from wake action and scarring of seagrass beds by propellers (Sargent <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Indirect Threats to Manatees from Human Activities: There is no commercial or subsistence utilization in the USA. However, manatees have become the centre of a large ecotourism industry at certain winter aggregation sites, such as Crystal River. Tens of thousands of people visit these areas to observe and swim with manatees. No-entry sanctuaries provide manatees with havens to avoid swimmers and boats at these sites. Manatees do, in fact, increase their use of these sanctuaries when more boats and swimmers are present (Buckingham <em>et al</em>. 1999, King and Heinen 2004). Manatees also have been found to alter their behaviour in response to the presence of human swimmers, including decreased resting and suckling and increased swimming (King and Heinen 2004).  <br/><br/>The tremendous growth in the human population in coastal Florida over the past half century has resulted in drastic losses of coastal wetland habitats. Seagrass distribution and abundance in many estuaries have declined as the result of direct human impacts (dredging and propeller scarring) and indirect effects of development (declining water quality and nutrient loading). Within Tampa Bay, for example, an estimated 80% of the seagrass present in the early 1900s was lost by 1980 (Kurz <em>et al</em>. 2000). This decline in seagrass coverage is slowly being reversed through actions to reduce nitrogen loading in the regional watershed, which have improved water clarity in much of Tampa Bay (Johansson and Greening 2000, Kurz <em>et al</em>. 2000). Non-point-source runoff is difficult to control, however, so water clarity declines in years of above-average precipitation. Reductions in optical water clarity cause declines in the health and abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (Stevenson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Indirect effects from increased vessel traffic include increased water turbidity from wake action and scarring of seagrass beds by propellers (Sargent <em>et al</em>. 1995). It will be particularly important to protect, restore, and maintain aquatic vegetation communities in the vicinity of warm-water aggregation sites. Without conservation measures to secure these winter habitats, manatees would have to travel greater distances, concentrate into smaller areas, and forage in sub-optimal environments.<br/><br/><strong>Natural Threats</strong><br/>Naturally-occurring catastrophic threats to manatees include prolonged periods of very cold temperatures, hurricanes, harmful algal blooms (i.e., âred tideâ), and the potential for a disease epizootic. The threat from extended periods of cold weather relates to the availability and quality of warm-water habitat, which has already been discussed above.  <br/><br/>Hurricanes:  Hurricanes are another type of weather-related phenomenon that can potentially impact manatee populations. In the Northwest subpopulation, Langtimm and Beck (2003) found that adult survival rate was depressed in years with severe storms or hurricanes. The mechanism(s) underlying the lower survival probabilities are unknown, as there has not been a corresponding elevation in the number of reported carcasses. Such events could also result in large-scale emigration out of the affected region. In eastern Australia, for example, the simultaneous occurrence of flooding and a cyclone, combined with poor watershed management practices, resulted in the loss of 1,000 kmÂ² of seagrass beds and in the mass movement and mortality of dugongs (<em>Dugong dugong</em>; Preen and Marsh 1995). Given the notice from meteorologists that we have entered a new 25- to 50-year cycle of greater hurricane activity and intensity (Landsea <em>et al</em>. 1996), as well as possible longer-term changes associated with global climate change (McCarthy <em>et al</em>. 2001), storm activity may have a greater impact on manatee populations in the future.  <br/><br/>Red Tide: Manatees on Floridaâs Gulf coast are frequently exposed to brevetoxin, a potent neurotoxin produced by the dinoflagellate <em>Karenia brevis</em> during red tide events. In 1996, 151 manatees were confirmed or suspected to have died in southwestern Florida from brevetoxicosis (Landsberg and Steidinger 1998, Bossart <em>et al</em>. 1998). This epizootic was particularly detrimental to the manatee population because more adults were killed than any other age class. Other red tide mortality events in 1982, 2002, 2003, and 2005 resulted in the confirmed red tide-related deaths of 37, 33, 86, and 68 manatees, respectively, with an additional 35 carcasses suspected to have died from red tide during those years (OâShea <em>et al</em>. 1991; FWC unpubl.). Recent studies have determined that brevetoxin can exist outside of the algal cells (e.g., on seagrass) for extended periods of time, thus further increasing the threat to foraging manatees (Flewelling <em>et al</em>. 2005). Red tide represents a major natural source of mortality for manatees in the southwest region. There is no clear evidence that these events have been increasing in frequency along Floridaâs coast, but certainly the impact on the manatee population has increased over the past two decades. The role of nutrient loading to coastal systems relative to the intensity and duration of inshore red tides is an active area of research for the FWRI harmful algal blooms group.<br/><br/>Pathogens: Manatees could potentially be exposed to pathogens. Spread of such pathogens could be particularly rapid during winter when manatees are concentrated in warm-water refuges. Large-scale mortality events caused by disease or toxins have decimated other populations of marine mammals, including seals and dolphins, removing 50% or more of the individuals in some events (Harwood and Hall 1990). Manatees have robust immune systems that have, through the present time, provided disease resistance. Since 1997 papilloma virus has been found in captive Florida manatees and there is some evidence that it may also be present in the wild population in northwest Florida (Bossart <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Woodruff <em>et al</em>. 2005). While the consensus is that this virus probably does not present a serious threat to manatees at this time, managers are proceeding cautiously (e.g., by establishing a quarantine on exposed captives) and surveillance for papilloma lesions in wild manatees continues.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>Major threats to survival of the Antillean manatee include habitat degradation and loss, hunting, incidental catch/accidental take, watercraft collisions, entanglement in fishing gear, pollution, natural disasters, and human disturbance. Although threats due to hunting are diminishing in some areas, all other threats are increasing in most areas. Illegal hunting for subsistence and profit was reported as a significant threat in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.  Pollution from agriculture and mining was consistently noted in reports from South American countries. Intrinsic factors that limit the populationâs ability to withstand these anthropogenic impacts include low fecundity, slow growth, limited dispersal, and restricted range.<br/><br/>Of particular note were: (1) In Belize, watercraft related mortality was reported as the major threat, followed by illegal hunting and entanglement in fishing gear; and (2) In north-eastern Brazil, the stranding of live-orphaned calves was identified as the main recent threat to the species (Parente <em>et al</em>. 2004). Between 1981 and 2002, 74 stranded manatees were reported on the north-eastern coast of Brazil with 58% (n=43) being live dependent calves. This high percentage suggested that that the main threat may be human disturbance resulting in mother-calf separation. Disturbance in the area is due to shrimp farms, salt farms, a general increase in human activities in the coastal zone, and uncontrolled tourism. Additional major threats include hunting, entanglement in fishing nets, watercraft collisions, indiscriminate development of the coast, and degradation of aquatic environments.","<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) recently conducted two Biological Status Reviews of the Florida manatee that involved comprehensive compilation and synthesis of population and range data, along with extensive modeling of population projections (FWC 2002, 2003; Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). In addition, the Manatee Population Status Working Group of the Florida Manatee Recovery and Implementation Team has produced a comprehensive Biological Population Assessment (MPSWG 2005).<br/><br/>There are no statistically based estimates (with variance) of abundance for the entire Florida manatee population. The minimum documented abundance is determined from range-wide synoptic surveys which have been conducted nearly every winter since 1991. The surveys are timed to coincide with periods of extreme cold weather when manatees aggregate at a limited number of warm-water sites. The highest count obtained during these surveys was 3,300 manatees in January 2001 (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006); this is presumed to be a minimum count, but the fraction detected is unknown. Based on the assumption of a stable age distribution, and estimating proportion mature to be 0.70 from the core biological population model, the estimated number of mature individuals in the population is 2,310. Because detection probability varies greatly with weather conditions and across sites, population experts have consistently cautioned against using these data for trend analyses.<br/><br/>Long-term studies of the Florida manatee indicate that there are four relatively distinct regional subpopulations, as recognized in the Florida Manatee Recovery Plan (USFWS 2001). Each subpopulation comprises individuals that tend to return to the same warm-water refuges each winter and have similar non-winter distribution patterns. Exchange of individuals among subpopulations is considered to be relatively limited, based on data from telemetry (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003) and photo-identification (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, FWC and USGS, unpubl.). The four subpopulations differ in abundance, demographic rates, habitats, and major threats. What follows is a summary of our understanding of their rates of population growth over the past decade and very brief statements on the status of each subpopulation. Minimum population sizes are provided by the high synoptic survey count of 5 to 6 January 2001 (FWC unpubl.). Population growth rates cited below were estimated by Runge and colleagues (2004) using a stage-based model that integrated mark-recapture estimates of survival and reproduction (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2004, Langtimm <em>et al</em>. 2004). The estimates of vital rates were made possible through a long-term, multi-agency effort to photographically identify individual manatees based on their distinct patterns of scars and mutilations (Beck and Reid 1995).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Atlantic Coast subpopulation extends along the entire east coast of Florida (including the Florida Keys and Florida Bay), coastal states northward along the Atlantic seaboard, and the lower St. Johns River north of Palatka. A total of 1,444 manatees were counted in the Atlantic region during the 2001 synoptic survey. Craig and Reynolds (2004) estimated that the population size of manatees using power plants on the Atlantic Coast during winter 2001 was 1,607 (95% Bayesian credible interval: 1,353 to 1,972). Over the most recent 10-year period, Runge <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated that the Atlantic subpopulation had grown at an annual rate of 1.0% per year (95% CI: -1.2 to 2.9%), but this was not statistically different from zero. The subpopulation may have increased slowly or it may have declined slightly over this time period. Craig and Reynolds (2004) used a Bayesian approach to model growth in aerial counts of manatees at several major aggregation sites along the Atlantic coast (primarily power plants). This model took into account manatee movement between surveys and variation in detection rates with ambient temperature. The trends in counts suggest the population of animals using Atlantic power plants increased at a rate of 5 to 7% per year from 1982 to 1989, leveled off (growth rate 0 to 4%yr<sup>-1</sup>) between 1990 and 1993, and has been increasing at about 4 to 6% per year since 1994. The discrepancy in growth rates of these two modeling approaches needs further investigation to provide a better understanding of population trends along the Atlantic coast.<br/> <br/><strong>Upper St. Johns River Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Upper St. Johns River subpopulation occurs in a much smaller area in the river south of Palatka. A total of 112 manatees were counted during the 2001 synoptic survey, but intensive observations that facilitate identification of nearly every individual using Blue Spring, the main overwintering site in the region, indicate that at least 141 different manatees visited the spring during that winter. A total of 190 manatees were counted at Blue Spring during a synoptic survey in 2006. The subpopulation occupying the Upper St. Johns River has shown strong growth over the past decade, increasing at an annual rate of 6.2% (95% CI: 3.7 to 8.1%) based on the stage-based model. This growth rate is supported by high survival and reproductive rates. This is the smallest of the four subpopulations, contributing less than 5% to the maximum synoptic count, but it is growing the fastest.<br/><br/><strong>Northwest Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Northwest subpopulation extends from the Pasco-Hernando County line along the central Gulf coast northward through the Florida Panhandle and including the coastal areas of adjoining states at least as far as Louisiana. A total of 377 manatees were counted in the Northwest region during the 2001 synoptic survey.  This subpopulation has grown at an annual rate of 3.7% (95% CI: 1.6 to 5.6%) over the past 10 years. This is the second smallest subpopulation, accounting for about 11% of the highest synoptic count. Its dynamics are similar to those of the USJ, with a high adult survival rate, except reproduction seems to be lower.<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Southwest subpopulation extends from the Pasco-Hernando County line (north of Tampa) southward to Whitewater Bay (part of Everglades National Park) in Monroe County. Minimum subpopulation size from the high synoptic survey count in 2001 was 1,367 individuals for the Southwest region. This subpopulation has declined at an estimated rate of -1.1% per year (95% CI: -5.4 to +2.4%) over the most recent eight-year period. The relatively wide confidence interval reflects greater uncertainty about survival and reproductive rates in this region, in part due to a shorter time series of sight-resight data. Estimates of adult survival are lower than those of all other subpopulations, probably due to the combined effects of chronic human-related (watercraft) mortality and episodic mortality events caused by red tide. It should also be noted that manatees in the Southwest subpopulation are found in a broad diversity of habitats from the more developed Tampa Bay to the more pristine reaches of Everglades National Park; demographic data are lacking for individuals in the southernmost parts of the region. Temporary emigration outside of the study areas may result in a downward bias in survival rates.<br/><br/>FWC has a wide-reaching manatee carcass salvage and necropsy programme that recovers nearly every dead manatee reported in the state of Florida. Consequently, we have a long time series of excellent data on causes of death. In all of the four subpopulations, adult mortality is mostly attributable to human-related causes, primarily watercraft collisions. However, because of the lower survival rates in the Atlantic and Southwest subpopulations, the impact of this anthropogenic mortality on population growth is much greater than in the other two regions. For the immature age class, perinatal mortality is the most common âcauseâ and watercraft collisions is the next highest known cause of death for all subpopulations (see Major Threats).<br/><br/>It is clear that the two smallest subpopulations have been growing over the past decade, while the two largest subpopulations have grown slightly, not at all, or may be declining. Available data suggest that the Southwest subpopulation is in decline. One way to estimate the overall growth rate for the Florida manatee is to take an average of the four subpopulation's growth rates, weighted by relative size. This yields a point estimate of 0.6% per year. Confidence intervals do not incorporate our uncertainty in the relative sizes of the subpopulations. That is, this point estimate assumes that the sighting detection rate in the synoptic survey was the same in each region in 2001, which is very unlikely, and that weights have remained constant over time. So, while the available data suggest that the point estimate of population growth for this subspecies may be close to zero or slightly positive, the associated uncertainty means that the population could be declining or increasing slightly.  <br/><br/>Population Projections:  FWC used population viability analysis models to address the three criteria that involved the probability of future population decline or extinction (FWC 2002, 2003; Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). The models were based on vital rate estimates for each of four subpopulations and they incorporated demographic and environmental stochasticity. The models simulated scenarios based on plausible future threats to manatees and their habitat, including expected declines in carrying capacity through loss of warm-water refugia (loss of power plant discharges, declines in spring flow), potential increases in mortality (mostly due to watercraft collisions) associated with projected human population growth, and natural catastrophic mortality events (red tide, cold, disease). The outcome of the most recent PVA model was that there is a 12.1% chance of a 50% decline in the next three generations (generation time estimated between 16.8 and 22.6 years), and a 55.5% chance of a 20% reduction in the next two generations (Criterion C1) (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). For details, peer reviews, and a fuller discussion of these results, assumptions, limitations, and conclusions, please see the FWCâs Biological Status Reviews of the Florida manatee.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>There are no statistically derived population estimates for <em>T. m. manatus</em> within its range, which historically covers 41 countries in the Wider Caribbean Region. Peer-reviewed publications are sparse, but there has been a significant increase in research on Antillean manatees over the past 10 years, resulting in many theses, presentations at regional meetings, local reports, and adoption of management plans. <br/><br/>We compiled data gathered through an extensive literature review and personal communication with 45 scientists representing expertise in 29 countries, but exclusive of the Florida manatee population (which was assessed independently). Antillean manatee populations occur in 20 of the 37 countries assessed, with sightings of vagrants in additional countries. However, distribution is not continuous and populations are patchy and fragmented. Using these documents, supplemented by the questionnaires completed by local experts, we derived a very rough minimum population estimate for the subspecies. Our confidence in population estimates varies dramatically from country to country, depending on the nature and extent of recent research efforts. For that reason, we used orders of magnitude in an effort to establish some baseline population estimates for each of the 20 countries where populations are most probably extant and viable. Although the quality and quantity of data vary from country to country, there is consistency regarding a continuing decline in both manatees and the quality and quantity of available habitat.  <br/><br/>Estimates by country, based on the best available data, range from less than 10 up to ~1,000 total animals, with the largest populations reported from Mexico and Belize (Table 1). No country reports an increasing country-wide population (except Bahamas with less than 10 animals). All publications and personal communications indicate country-wide populations are declining, stable, or unknown. In a few countries, localized populations may be increasing; in most countries, reports indicate a significant decline over the past 30-50 years, but this is based solely on anecdotal evidence and/or interviews with local people. <br/><br/>While the data in Table 1 suggest that approximately 2,600 individuals exist, scattered widely through the Caribbean region, optimistic ""estimates"" of the size of the manatee population (also based on interviews with experts in different countries, and not necessarily on empirical data) suggest that it may actually be in the range of 5,600 individuals. The age structure of the various manatee subpopulations of <em>T. m. manatus</em> is unknown, but the percentage of mature animals in Florida was estimated to be 70% through population modeling (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006) and 46% through carcass recovery (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Marmontel 1995, Marmontel <em>et al</em>. 1997). The figure based on carcasses is biased low due to the presence of a large proportion of calves in the sample. We note that hunting and other threats in the Caribbean may lead to a very different age structure for <em>T. m. manatus</em> than for <em>T. m. latirostris</em>; in fact, if hunters target large (i.e., mature) manatees, the percentage of mature individuals for <em>T. m. manatus</em> could be substantially lower than is the case for <em>T. m. latirostris</em>. Therefore, we consider that the percentage of mature individuals for the Antillean subspecies is likely to lie somewhere between 46% and 70%. <br/><br/>Based on the above information, we feel it is likely that the actual population size is intermediate between the number counted (2,600; minimum population size) and the more optimistic suggestions (5,600); an average between those two numbers would place the actual population size at approximately 4,100 manatees. Using this average value, and the two percentages given above for mature animals, the number of mature individuals would therefore lie between 1,886 and 2,870. Selecting the average value between these numbers produces an estimate of 2,378 mature individuals. While we do not place much significance in these average values, it is reasonable to conclude - based on the available evidence and taking the precautionary approach - that the overall number of mature individuals in this subspecies is likely to be less the 2,500.",Decreasing,"Florida manatees (<em>T. m. latirostris</em>) are found only in the United States, although a few vagrants have been known to reach the Bahamas. Their year-round distribution is restricted to peninsular Florida because they need warm water to survive the winter. During the non-winter months (March to November), some manatees disperse to adjoining states. Along the Atlantic coast these states include Georgia (highest manatee use outside of Florida), South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia; one satellite-tagged manatee traveled as far north as Rhode Island (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003), and another manatee was observed in New York (Long Island). Along the Gulf coast west of Florida, manatees are occasionally sighted in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The source (Florida or Mexico) of the Texas manatees is not always clear, but the weight of recent genetic and other evidence suggests most are from the Florida subspecies. Major freshwater bodies utilized by manatees in Florida include Lake Okeechobee, St. Johns River, Suwannee River, Caloosahatchee River, among others.<br/><br/>During the warm season (March or April through October or November, depending on latitude and year), manatees disperse throughout the coastal waters, estuaries, and major rivers of Florida and some migrate to neighboring states, particularly south-eastern Georgia. Their range constricts dramatically in the winter season (December to February) when manatees seek shelter from the cold at a limited number of warm-water sites or areas in the southern two-thirds of Florida. These sites include 10 principal power plant thermal outfalls (seven on the Atlantic coast, three on the Gulf coast) and four major artesian springs (Blue Spring, springs at the head of Crystal River, Homosassa Spring, and Warm Mineral Spring) that are frequented by a large proportion of the manatee population during winter.<br/><br/>The Antillean Manatee (<em>T. m. manatus</em>) inhabits riverine and coastal systems in the tropical and subtropical Western Atlantic Coastal Zone from the Bahamas to Brazil, including the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Although at least one individual in the Bahamas is a known migrant from Florida (Reid 2000, 2001), the Bahamas is detailed in this <em>T. m. manatus</em> assessment rather than the <em>T. m. latirostris</em> assessment. During the past decade, populations have been confirmed in the coastal waters and/or rivers of at least 19 of the 37 countries with historical records (Table 1); a population may be extant in Haiti (Ottenwalder 1995), although in very reduced numbers if at all. Rare sightings, categorized as vagrants, have been documented in five additional countries (Debrot Gore pers. comm).<br/><br/>See the Supplementary Material&#160;for Table 1: Summary of reported data by country for extant manatee populations.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>The following text was excerpted directly from the Florida Manatee Recovery Plan (USFWS 2001), with condensation and some minor revisions from the assessors. The state of Floridaâs Manatee Management Plan is due to be completed by June 2007 and will provide further details of planned management and conservation actions.  <br/><br/><strong>Efforts to Reduce Watercraft-Related Injuries and Deaths</strong><br/>The largest identified cause of manatee death is collisions with watercraft. Many living manatees also bear scars or wounds from vessel strikes. Because watercraft operators cannot reliably detect and avoid hitting manatees, federal and state managers have sought to limit watercraft speed in areas where manatees are most likely to occur to afford both manatees and boaters time to avoid collisions. In 1989, the Florida Governor and Cabinet approved a series of recommendations by the former FDNR to improve protection of manatees in 13 key counties. Since then state and local governments have cooperated in the creation and implementation of county Manatee Protection Plans and county-wide manatee protection speed zone rules. Two types of manatee protection areas also have been developed by FWS: (1) manatee sanctuaries, areas in which all waterborne activities are prohibited; and (2) manatee refuges areas where certain waterborne activities are restricted or prohibited. FWS and FWC continue to evaluate needs for additional protection areas that may be necessary to achieve recovery. The goal is to consider the needs of the manatee at an ecosystem level and to establish regulations to ensure that adequate protected areas are available throughout Florida to satisfy habitat requirements of the Florida manatee population with a view toward recovery.<br/><br/>In recent years, both the FWS and FWC have been using targeted enforcement strategies in an attempt to increase boater compliance with speed zones and ultimately reduce manatee injuries and death. FWSâ strategy has been to allocate significant enforcement manpower to specific areas on designated weekends. These enforcement teams travel to various locations around the state, with particular emphasis given to those zones within counties where there is a history of high watercraft-caused manatee deaths. FWC has increased its emphasis on enforcement and compliance with manatee speed zones by adding new officers, conducting law enforcement task force initiatives, increasing overtime, and increasing the proportion of law enforcement time devoted to manatee conservation.<br/><br/>Managers, researchers, and the boating industry have investigated the use of various devices to aid in the reduction of watercraft-related manatee deaths. For example, the State of Florida funded an evaluation of propeller guards (Milligan and Tennant 1998). The stateâs evaluation concluded that these devices would reduce cutting damage associated with propellers when boats were operating at low speeds. However, when boats (including boats equipped with propeller guards) operate at high speeds, guards would be of little benefit because animals would continue to be killed by blunt trauma associated with impacts from boat hulls, lower units, and other gear. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) identified additional concerns, stating that propeller guards on small recreational vessels âmay create more problems than they solveâ and does not support their use on recreational vessels at this time (Carmichael 2001). There are propeller guard applications, however, that appear to work for certain large, commercial vessels; for example, the use of guards on C-tractor tugs has eliminated this specific source of manatee mortality at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in St. Marys, Georgia. To prevent injuries to manatees, propeller guards are used on some rental and sight-seeing boats at Blue Spring and Crystal River.<br/><br/>Researchers have also begun to investigate the manateesâ acoustic environment to better evaluate the animalâs response to vessel traffic. This line of research needs to be thoroughly assessed for its potential as another management tool to minimize collisions between manatees and boats. Results from Gerstein <em>et al</em>. (1999) indicate that manatees hear in the range from 500 Hz to 46 kHz and that inadequate hearing sensitivity at low frequencies may be a contributing factor to the manateesâ ability to effectively detect boat noise to avoid collisions. One technology often discussed is an acoustic deterrence device mounted on a boat.  Conceptually, this technological approach may sound like an answer to the manatee/watercraft issue. A number of problems have been defined with the use of acoustic deterrents. No alarm/warning device has yet been demonstrated to adequately protect wildlife or marine mammals. Additionally, concern has also been stated regarding the increase in background noise that these deterrents would add to an already noisy marine environment. It has not been determined what negative impacts this device would have on marine life and what effects it would have on animals that use acoustic cues for a variety of purposes. For these reasons, this technology needs to be thoroughly researched and assessed and managers need to evaluate the MMPA and ESA âtakeâ issues related to implementing such technology.<br/><br/>Current research into the sensory capabilities of manatees is being supported at both the state and federal levels. One study assessed the effects of boat noise in a more controlled environment, by recording the physical and acoustic reaction of a manatee to a pre-determined acoustical level. This study design will allow the development of a relationship between acoustic amplitude and behavioural responses. Another study examined acoustical propagation over various types of marine topography. In cooperation with Mote Marine Laboratory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the FWC is also examining manatee behavioural response to watercraft using new technology, the DTAG, a digital acoustic tag which records acoustic attributes of the environment and detailed manatee movement simultaneously. A study to assess manatee behaviours in the presence of fishing gear and their response to novelty and the potential for reducing gear interactions also has an acoustic component. The FWC is also supporting the development and implementation of technological solutions for reducing the risks that watercraft pose to manatees. <br/><br/>Additional priority actions to better protect manatees include boater education, maintenance of signs and buoys, compliance assessment, and periodic re-evaluation of the effectiveness of the rules. Such work requires close cooperation between FWC Imperiled Species Management, FWCâs Division of Law Enforcement, county officials, the Inland Navigation Districts, FWS, USCG, and, of course, boaters.<br/><br/><strong>Efforts to Reduce Flood Gate and Navigation Lock Deaths</strong><br/>Entrapment in water-control structures and navigational locks is the second largest cause of human-related manatee deaths. In some cases, manatees appear to have been crushed in closing gates; in others, they may have been drowned after being pinned against narrow gate openings by water currents. Water-control structures implicated in manatee deaths in Dade and Broward counties are operated by the South Florida WMD. From 1976 through 2000, 166 manatees have been killed in water control structures in Dade County alone, accounting for 33% of all manatee deaths in this county. In the early 1980s, steps were taken to modify gate-opening procedures to ensure openings were wide enough to allow a manatee to pass through unharmed. Steps were also initiated to fence off openings and cavities in gate structures where manatees might become trapped. Manatee deaths subsequently declined and remained low for much of that decade. Much progress has been made toward identifying, testing, and installing manatee protection devices (e.g., pressure sensors) at water control structures. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) has also installed removable barriers on the upstream side of the Ortona and St. Lucie Lock spillway structures. The large difference in the upstream and downstream water levels at these structures compromises the effectiveness and use of pressure sensor devices. Locks frequented by manatees have been retrofitted with an acoustic array on the gates; this device detects the presence of a manatee during lock closing to avoid pinning or crushing. An interagency task force, established in 1991, continues to monitor, examine and make recommendations to protect manatees at water control structures and navigational locks.<br/><br/><strong>Habitat Protection</strong><br/>Intensive coastal development throughout Florida poses a long-term threat to the Florida manatee. There are three major approaches to address this problem. First, FWS, FWC, Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GDNR), and other recovery partners review and comment on applications for federal and state permits for construction projects in manatee habitat areas and to minimize their impacts. Under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, FWS annually reviews hundreds of permit applications to the ACOE for construction projects in waters and wetlands that include or are adjacent to important manatee habitat. FWC and GDNR provide similar reviews to their respective stateâs environmental permitting programs.<br/><br/>A second approach is the development of county manatee protection plans. The provisions of these plans are implemented through amendments to local growth management plans under the Floridaâs Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act of 1985. In addition to boat speed rules, manatee protection plans are to include boat facility siting policies and other measures to protect manatees and their habitat.<br/><br/>A third approach to habitat protection is land acquisition. Both FWS and the State of Florida have taken steps to acquire and add new areas containing important manatee habitat to federal and state protected area systems. The State of Florida has acquired important areas through several programs, most notably the Florida Forever Program. In Florida, the Governor and Cabinet have included special consideration for purchase of lands that can be of benefit to manatees and their habitat. Over $500 million has been spent to acquire 250,000 acres, whose importance included, but was by no means limited to, protection of manatee habitat. FWS has also acquired and now manages thousands of acres of land important to manatees and many other species in the NWR System. In addition to these efforts, FWSâs initiative to propose new manatee refuges and sanctuaries factors into habitat protection. Both the State of Florida and FWS are continuing cooperative efforts with a view towards establishing a network of important manatee habitats throughout Florida.<br/><br/><strong>Manatee Rescue, Rehabilitation and Release</strong><br/>Thousands of reports of distressed manatees purportedly in need of assistance have been made to the state wildlife enforcement offices and other resource protection agencies by a concerned public. While most of the manatees do not require assistance, dozens of manatees are rescued and treated each year. A network of state and local agencies and private organizations, coordinated by FWS, has been rescuing and treating these animals for well over 20 years.<br/><br/>Manatees are brought into captivity when stressed by cold weather, when struck and injured by watercraft, when injured because of entanglements in crab traps and monofilament fishing line, when orphaned, and when compromised by other natural and man-made factors. Programme veterinarians and staff have developed treatments and protocols for these animals and have been remarkably successful in their efforts to rehabilitate compromised individuals. Since 1973, over 180 manatees have been treated and returned to the wild (FWS unpubl.).<br/><br/>Media coverage of manatee rescues, treatments, and releases helps to educate millions of people about manatees, the life-threatening problems that they face, and actions that can be taken to minimize the effect of anthropogenic activities on this species. In addition, more than 18 million visitors a year see manatees at rehabilitation facilities and participate in manatee education programs sponsored by several parks. The publicity and outreach inherent in this program provide significant support to efforts to recover the manatee.<br/><br/><strong>Public Education, Awareness, and Support</strong><br/>Government agencies, industries, oceanaria and environmental groups have all contributed to manatee public awareness and education efforts that were initiated in the 1970s. These efforts have expanded in scope and increased in quantity since that time. Some key counties in Florida have also started the education component of their manatee protection plans. These public awareness and education efforts encourage informed public participation in regulatory and other management decision-making processes and provide constructive avenues for private funding of state manatee recovery programs, research, and land acquisition efforts through programmes such as the specialty automobile license tag for manatees.<br/><br/>The public has been made aware of new information on the biology and status of manatees, urgent conservation issues, and the regulations and measures required to assure their protection through the production of brochures, posters, films and videos, press releases, public service announcements and advertisements, and other media-oriented materials. Outdoor signs have been produced that provide general manatee information and highlight the problems associated with feeding manatees.<br/><br/>Manatee viewing opportunities have also been made available to the public. In addition, volunteers from several organizations annually give presentations to schools and other groups and distribute educational materials at festivals and events. Such efforts are essential for obtaining public compliance with conservation measures to protect manatees and their habitats.<br/><br/>Many public awareness materials have been developed specifically focusing on boater education. Public awareness waterway signs are produced and distributed alerting boaters to the presence of manatees. Brochures, boat decals, boaterâs guides, and other materials with manatee protection tips and boating safety information have been produced and are distributed by law enforcement groups, through marinas, and boating safety classes. Educational kiosks have been designed and installed at marinas, boat ramps, and other waterfront locations. Monofilament fishing line collection sites and cleanup efforts are being established.  Several agencies and organizations provide educatorâs guides, posters, and coloring and activity books to teachers in Florida and across the United States. In addition, Save The Manatee Club (SMC) and FWC Advisory Council on Environmental Education have produced a video for distribution to schools throughout Florida and the United States. SMC and FWC also provide free manatee education packets to students and staff interviews for students. Agencies and organizations help to educate law enforcement personnel about manatees and inform them about available outreach materials that can be distributed to user groups.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>Conservation of the Antillean manatee at the regional level has been driven by the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (Freestone 1991), resulting in the Regional Management Plan for the West Indian Manatee, <em>Trichechus manatus</em> (UNEP 1995). In all countries with extant populations there is protective legislation with some effort towards conservation through governmental agencies and/or non-governmental organizations. In a few countries efforts have increased significantly over the past decade. Conservation measures include: (1) policy-based actions such as protective legislation, management plans, recovery plans, and community management; (2) educational outreach programs and awareness activities; (3) research actions such as site specific and country-wide surveys, behavioural studies both in captivity and in situ, remote sensing projects, health assessments, and genetic studies; (4) habitat and site-based actions such as protected areas and community-based initiatives; and (5) species-based actions such as re-introductions, stranding networks, and rehabilitation programs.<br/><br/>The species is listed on CITES Appendix I.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
13036088,222,Acipenser brevirostrum,Vulnerable,A2ce; B1ab(iii),2004,2004-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Shortnose sturgeon is a relatively small species, sympatric in U.S. and Canadian Atlantic Coast rivers and estuaries with the larger Atlantic sturgeon (<em>A. o. oxyrhinchus</em>). Historically the two species were harvested commercially for flesh and caviar, but no species differentiation was recorded in the landings data. <br/> <br/>Although some shortnose sturgeon may still be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are habitat related resulting from loss or degradation. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).   <br/> <br/>Shortnose Sturgeon stocks appear to be stable and even increasing in a few large rivers but remain seriously depressed in others, particularly southern populations. Previous Red Lists listed the species as Vulnerable. Since that earlier listing, a Recovery Plan has been developed and is being implemented and genetically distinct population segments have been identified. Although exploitation is no longer a serious concern, effects of habitat alteration and degradation and water quality (contaminant) concerns remain. Thus, the shortnose sturgeon should continue to receive a Vulnerable listing. This is based, in part, on an estimated population reduction of greater than 30% over the past three generations with some irreversible habitat losses and continued concern about impacts of pollutants and water-based development activities on population health. We also note extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals between rivers, from a few hundred or less in the Chesapeake Bay to perhaps 10,000 or more in the Hudson.","Shortnose sturgeon use of saltwater is generally amphidromous throughout most of the species' range, although far northern populations are anadromous (Kynard 1997). Spawning takes place in upper freshwater areas, while feeding (summering) and wintering occurs in both fresh and saline environments. This species typically spends its entire life history in the natal river and estuary and only rarely moves any great distance in near-coastal marine waters. There are no naturally land-locked populations of the species, but two rivers have populations that are segmented by dams.
<br/>
<br/>This species typically attains an adult size of 75â100 cm total length, though the maximum recorded size for a Canadian-caught female was 1.43 m and 23.6 kg (Dadswell <em>et al</em>. 1984).  Maximum ages determined for female and male shortnose sturgeon (again in Canada) were 67 and 32 years, respectively (Vladykov and Greeley 1963).  Prespawning migrations in northern populations are triggered by increasing water temperatures of 7â10Â°C, and during spawning, males are attracted to females by a female pheromone (Kynard and Horgan 2002a).  Spawning occurs at water temperatures of 7â15Â°C.  Spawning habitat is a substrate of rock or large gravel (usually rubble), and water depth during spawning is highly variable. Spawning suitability windows follow day length of 13.9â14.9 h, water temperature of 6.5â15Â°C, and river discharge that provides 30â120 cm/sec (mean 70 cm/sec) bottom velocity. All spawning windows must be open simultaneously for spawning to occur. Yearling shortnose sturgeon initiate the major dispersal that moves young fish to join older juveniles and adults in fresh or salt water foraging concentration areas. Yearling and older juveniles use the same summering and wintering habitats as adults (Kynard <em>et al</em>. 2000).
<br/>
<br/>In southern waters, shortnose males may mature in 2-3 years and females in 4-6 years. In northern portions of the range, maturation may not occur for 10-15 years (maximum). Spawning periodicity is poorly understood but in the northern part of the range, females are highly variable (2-9 years) and males spawn at 1-5 year intervals depending on fish age and foraging conditions. Some males in northern populations spawn annually.","Although some shortnose sturgeon may be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are blockage of up- and downstream migrations at dams, habitat loss or degradation due to dams and dam operations, river channel dredging, and pollution. Southern populations are particularly at risk due to water withdrawal from rivers and groundwaters and from eutrophication that directly degrades river water quality causing loss of habitat. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).","The estimate of the total current population size for the Hudson River indicates a 95% confidence interval of 26,000 to 55,000 individuals. The Saint John, Kennebec, and Delaware subpopulations appear to be on the order of 5,000 to 15,000 fish each. Estimates of other northern populations are the Connecticut River (CT-MA) â about 1,200 fish, and the Merrimack River (MA) of less than 100 individuals (Kieffer and Kynard 1993, Kynard 1997, Savoy 2004). Though many rivers in the southern region have been documented to contain shortnose sturgeon, few have had population estimates conducted. Only abundance in the Ogeechee and Altamaha rivers of Georgia have been estimated and both appear to be on the order of 1,000 fish each (Rogers and Weber 1994). Shortnose sturgeon occur only rarely in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and no breeding population has been confirmed here.
<br/>
<br/>Walsh <em>et al</em>. (2001) analyzed shortnose sturgeon populations from two drainages in Maine and the Hudson River for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences between the Kennebec and Androscoggin stocks and even greater separation when compared to the Hudson stock. These data support the putative stock structure and distinct population segment designation adopted for shortnose sturgeon.",Decreasing,"Shortnose sturgeons occur in many of the large coastal rivers of eastern North America. From survey and tagging data, the National Marine Fisheries Service now recognizes 19 distinct population segments. The Shortnose Sturgeon Recovery Team considered sturgeon populations from two general regions, northern rivers and southern rivers. The largest populations in the northern region appear to be in the Saint John, NB, Canada (Dadswell 1979), Delaware, NJ-PA (Hastings <em>et al</em>. 1987), Kennebec, ME (Squiers <em>et al</em>. 1982), and Hudson, NY rivers (Bain <em>et al</em>. 1995).  <br/> <br/>See the <a href=""%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.natureserve.org/explorer/%E2%80%9C"">NatureServe Explorer</a> database for a more detailed description of this speciesâ range.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The shortnose sturgeon was listed as endangered under the inaugural U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1967. At that time, very little information was available regarding life history and behavior of this species. Since then, considerable work has been accomplished to determine habitats and migrations important to each life stage, population status, genetic assessment, use of fish passage and fish protection structures, and fish culture. The Shortnose Sturgeon Recovery and Management Plan (NMFS 1998) identifies recovery actions that would help to establish population levels that would allow de-listing of the shortnose sturgeon. <br/> <br/>Captive broodstock and several generations of progeny are currently being held at federal fish hatcheries operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and at a research laboratory of the U.S. Geological Survey. Additionally, several years of research on spawning has produced larvae from natural mate selection and spawning of adults in an artificial spawning stream, a process that appears to produce superior young fish for conservation stocking.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix I.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
13036599,223,Acipenser fulvescens,Least Concern,,2004,2004-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Acipenser fulvescens</em> was assessed by the IUCN SSC Sturgeon Specialist Group in 1996 as Vulnerable. A more detailed look at the data available for this species has resulted in it being downgraded to Least Concern. <br/> <br/>The lake sturgeon occupies the United States and Canadian waters of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River basin; Lake Champlain (Vermont-New York); the Lake Winnebago-Fox River complex (Wisconsin); Canadaâs Hudson and James Bay watersheds; the Saskatchewan River (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba); and the Mississippi River basin area from the headwaters in Minnesota to the northern portion of the state of Louisiana and up the Missouri River into southern South Dakota. Well-regulated sport fisheries occur throughout the northern part of the range and Canada manages modest commercial fisheries in Ontario and Quebec provinces.  <br/> <br/>Although very little stock assessment is underway, the lake sturgeon subpopulation in the Mississippi and lower Missouri river basins is believed to be stable but relatively small, certainly compared to levels in the late 1800s prior to development of modern locks, dams and reservoirs. Area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and quality of habitats in this part of the speciesâ range are all diminished compared to historic conditions.  Restocking efforts using cultured fish are modest and fragmented among the states but results from Missouri DOC stockings are encouraging. Since there is currently no concerted basin-wide or interstate plan to manage or restore this stock, the Mississippi river basin lake sturgeon subpopulation is considered to be Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>The largest proportion of the global population lies in the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River basin areas where numerous management and recovery plans are in place among and between states and provinces sharing boundary waters. Most threats here are understood and essential conservation measures are being implemented. Populations of lake sturgeon are being monitored and assessed and most segments of the stock appear to be increasing. Based upon all of the above information and IUCN definitions, the species currently is not facing a threat to its survival and is categorized as Least Concern (LC).","Based on pectoral fin ray sections it has been determined that lake sturgeon can live to be over 100 years old. One individual caught in Lake of the Woods, Ontario in 1953 was estimated to be 152 years old (Priegel and Wirth 1971). Lake sturgeon can reach lengths of 1.9 m, and weigh 91 kg. However, a 141 kg lake sturgeon was reportedly caught in Lake Superior in 1922 and a fish of equal weight was caught in Lake Michigan in 1943. Most fish reported in the literature were less than 35 years old.
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon from Black Lake in Michigan measured 75â193 cm total length (TL) and were 9â64 years old, with most fish less than 20 years old (Baker and Borgeson 1999). In the Lake Winnebago system of Wisconsin, female lake sturgeon reach sexual maturity between 24â26 years of age when they are about 140 cm long. Females spawn only every 3â6 years and can produce up to 700,000 eggs each time. Few male lake sturgeon mature before they are 114 cm long or 14â16 years old. Males spawn every one or two years (Priegel and Wirth 1971, Lyons and Kempinger 1992). In the Sturgeon River of Upper Michigan, male spawning intervals of two, three and four years were observed while females returned to spawn every three to seven years (Auer 1999). In Canadian rivers and lakes, mature male lake sturgeon range in size from 76â98 cm and females 84â117 cm (Houston 1987). Compared to sturgeon from Lake Winnebago and the Great Lakes, relatively little information is available regarding age, growth, maturity and spawning periodicity of lake sturgeon in the Mississippi River basin.
<br/>
<br/>During the spring season, lake sturgeon spawning occurs when water temperatures rise and reach 9â15 Â°C (Priegel and Wirth 1971, Kempinger 1988).  Spawning sturgeon will select shallow areas over hard clean substrate with relatively strong current velocities (Kempinger 1988).
<br/>
<br/>Usual lake sturgeon habitat is the highly productive shoal areas of larger lakes and rivers. They require moderate to swift currents and large rough substrates for spawning and embryo development. Lake sturgeon in the Upper Mississippi River prefer habitat in or adjacent to flow, but with relatively low to moderate current velocity (Knights, B. C., USGS, unpublished data).  They are rarely found in backwater habitats without flow. In the Mississippi basin habitat that is in or adjacent to current is generally depositional and has relatively compact silt or silt-sand substrates with presumed high densities of benthic invertebrates. These areas occur at the lower end of navigation pools near the main channel, the mouths of tributaries and large secondary channels, and at some channel border areas. While migrating, presumably en-route to spawning habitats or high use (feeding/home) areas, lake sturgeon will use areas of the river with relatively high current velocities including tailwaters, the main channel in the upper and mid reaches of navigation pools, and tributaries.
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon are known to move great distances to spawning and feeding habitats (Auer 1996). Wisconsin DNR recently reported that a sturgeon originally tagged in Lake Winnebago in October 1978 was recovered almost 19 years later at Locust Point Reef in Lake Erie, a minimum travel distance of almost 1,100 km (R. Bruch, WI DNR, news release).","The life history characteristics of slow growth, late maturation, and irregular spawning periodicity make lake sturgeon subpopulations particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. Anthropogenic effects such as industrial and municipal pollution, blockage of access to habitats by dykes and dams, channeliszation and elimination of backwater areas, dewatering and water level fluctuations, physical destruction of spawning habitat, and inundation of habitat by reservoirs are known to threaten sturgeon subpopulations (Rochard <em>et al</em>. 1990, Auer 1996, Beamesderfer and Farr 1997, Noakes <em>et al</em>. 1999). Direct mortality of lake sturgeon due to impacts with commercial and/or recreational navigation vessels has been documented.  <br/> <br/>Dams may be the greatest impediment to lake sturgeon rehabilitation in the Great Lakes. Although there are numerous recorded instances of tagged sturgeon passing through navigation locks, many fish are precluded or delayed from reaching spawning or preferred feeding waters. Dams without locks completely block sturgeon passage and serve as severe impediments to lake sturgeon recovery in the Mississippi basin. Spawning and nursery areas are further degraded from land use problems such as erosion, sedimentation, and adverse discharges from point and non-point sources. Other concerns in the Great Lakes include stream channelization, over-exploitation and/or illegal harvest, lack of public concern and potential adverse impacts of lampricides on sensitive life stages.  <br/> <br/>Although lake sturgeon harvest from the Mississippi River is prohibited, financial incentive to collect roe for caviar remains. Small population sizes may limit poachers from targeting this species but it is likely that incidental captures are utilized and end up in the black market. With the first stocking of lake sturgeon by Missouri DOC now at age 17, there is increasing concern that poachers will target them as the females reach maturity within the next few years.","Lake sturgeon were, and in some cases continue to be, an important component of Native American diet and culture. Up until about 1870, lake sturgeon were primarily considered a nuisance by commercial fisherman and were stacked on the shores to rot (Milner 1874 cited in Becker 1983). Within the next 30 years the value of sturgeon for flesh and the use of roe for caviar became economically important. During heavy fishing years in the late 1800s lake sturgeon harvest from the Great Lakes averaged over 1,814 metric tons (mt) per year. In the peak harvest year of 1885, 4,901 mt were reported of which 2,359 tons came from Lake Erie alone. Sturgeon populations declined dramatically after 1900 and although some incidental harvest was reported until 1977, numbers were extremely low after 1956.
<br/>
<br/>Although lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes were greatly reduced due to overfishing during the last several decades of the nineteenth century they appear to be on the rebound throughout the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence basins with spawning populations being documented from 63 locations and spawning size estimates calculated for 17 of these sites.  The current status of lake sturgeon populations in most of the Great Lakes Basin, the St. Lawrence River and in Wisconsinâs Lake Winnebago system is stable or increasing. 
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon were generally considered to be rare to uncommon in most waters of the Mississippi River basin since the late 1800s. In 1989, this species was declared as threatened by the American Fisheries Society in all Mississippi River states except Louisiana where they are believed to be extirpated (Williams <em>et al</em>. 1989). The Department of Natural Resources in Iowa and Illinois and the Missouri Department of Conservation list the lake sturgeon as endangered in their respective states, and in Minnesota, the lake sturgeon is listed as a species of special concern. The species appears to be extirpated from its former range in Alabama and Arkansas.
<br/>
<br/>The current status of lake sturgeon throughout the Mississippi basin is considered to be severely depressed from historical abundance levels. However, modern population assessment studies are lacking and rate of stock decline or growth is unknown. Native stocks were extremely depressed prior to the stocking program undertaken by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Following the first releases into Mark Twain Lake (Salt River, a Pool 24 tributary) in 1984, then at Louisiana on Pool 24 of the Mississippi River and at several Missouri River locations in 1988, increasing reports of incidental catch in commercial gear and by recreational anglers has been occurring.",Increasing,"Lake sturgeon spend their entire life cycle in freshwater and are widely distributed in North America. They currently range throughout much of the drainages of the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, the St. Lawrence River, Hudson Bay-James Bay, and the Saskatchewan River (Pflieger 1975, Becker 1983, Ferguson and Duckworth 1997). In the Mississippi basin this species occurs from the headwaters in Minnesota to the northern portion of the state of Louisiana and up the Missouri River into southern South Dakota. There is no known natural exchange of stocks between the Great Lakes and western Canadian provinces and those of the Mississippi River basin, though some stockings in the Mississippi have included lake sturgeon of Great Lakes Basin origin.  <br/> <br/>For a more detailed description of this speciesâ range, see <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/"">NatureServeâs Explorer database</a>.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Commercial harvest of lake sturgeon is prohibited in all U.S. waters and strictly managed in Canadian waters with closed seasons, size limits and gear restrictions.  <br/> <br/>Angling in some waters of Michigan is allowed with several restrictions as to season, fish sizes and gear. In Wisconsin, harvest is limited to two separate sportfishing seasons. Spear fishermen must purchase a one-fish sturgeon spear tag and they are allowed to spear a fish from early February until a specified quota is reached. In Lake Winnebago, the 2000 quota was set at 400 adult females, 400 juvenile females and 2,150 males. Once 80% of the quota is reached the fishery is closed after the next day. Typical spear fishing harvest in recent years produced 1,500 to 2,500 fish. Wisconsinâs hook and line fishery allows the catch of one fish per angler per season with a minimum size range of 127â178 cm, depending on location, during early September through 15 October. All anglers must apply for and use a free tag and the fishery produces about 300â400 fish per season.  <br/> <br/>Sport fishing for lake sturgeon is currently prohibited in the Mississippi River but is allowed in some tributaries in Wisconsin and Minnesota (e.g., Wisconsin, Chippewa, and St. Croix rivers) during a short hook and line season in the fall.  Angling in Minnesota has several restrictions as to season, fish sizes and gear and the reported annual sport catch was 2,200â4,200 kg in 1998â2000.  Harvest is not allowed in Iowa, Ohio, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and South Dakota. <br/> <br/>According to the CITES Management Authority of Canada (CMAC 2000) sturgeon harvest in Canada consists of aboriginal, commercial and recreational fisheries. The entire North American commercial harvest of lake sturgeon comes from Canada where in 1997, 223 mt were caught in New Brunswick and Quebec, with 90% (200 mt) being taken from the St. Lawrence River. Catch in Ontario during the late 1990s ranged from 5â8 mt. Most of this came from Lake Huron with a small amount from Lake St. Clair. In 1998, international trade in lake sturgeon meat was reported to be 18.2 mt exported from Canada to the U.S. (mostly New York). No caviar exports are reported and no export quotas have been established by range states. Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans reported that in recent years total recreational catch from the North and South Saskatchewan rivers in Alberta and Saskatchewan amounted to about 1,000 fish. <br/> <br/><em>Acipenser fulvescens</em> is not listed as a species at risk by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Most subpopulations are thought to be capable of sustaining well-regulated fisheries. Although the species is managed and protected in Canada under the Federal Fisheries Act, regulations differ between provinces and are revised annually. This species is listed under provincial legislation as ""threatened"" in Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan (CMAC 2000). <br/> <br/>In recent years, interest in the restoration of lake sturgeon has increased greatly. Partnerships have been developed throughout the Great Lakes basin between state and federal natural resource agencies, commercial and sport fishers and other water users. Numerous management and recovery plans have been completed for select waters within the lake sturgeon range and are being implemented as resources allow. Their goals include conservation, rehabilitation and enhancement of sturgeon populations, completion of status assessments, harvest restrictions, identification and restoration of critical habitats and elimination of negative effects of dams.  <br/> <br/>Construction of spawning habitats using coarse stone rip-rapping has been undertaken in some states (particularly Wisconsin) and appears to be highly successful. Artificial culture and restocking of lake sturgeon is under development in Minnesota using wild broodstock. In New York, sturgeon eggs are taken from wild stocks in the St. Lawrence River and cultured fingerlings have been reared and released in several locations since 1995. Survival has been high and populations appear to be recovering. In Missouri over 210,000 lake sturgeon fingerlings have been stocked in the upper Mississippi and lower Missouri rivers since 1986. Survival of stocked fish is considered excellent as tagged lake sturgeon have been recaptured in the Mississippi, Missouri, Gasconade and Osage rivers and commercial fishermen have reported incidental catches reaching nuisance proportions (Hesse and Carreiro 1997).  Artificial culture and restocking of lake sturgeon is also under development in Minnesota using wild broodstock. Wisconsin DNR propagates some lake sturgeon for restocking purposes with cultured fish only being placed into the same basins from which broodstock were taken. The Tennessee Valley Authority has stocked thousands of young lake sturgeon within the Ohio River Basin.   <br/> <br/>A Lake Sturgeon Management Plan has been implemented in Alberta since 1997. This involves a zero catch limit on the North Saskatchewan River; and on the South Saskatchewan, a closed season during the 1 April to 15 June spawning period with a one fish limit (greater than 130 cm) outside that restricted season. There is no aboriginal fishery in Alberta. In Saskatchewan, a self-imposed moratorium on commercial catch of lake sturgeon has been in place since 1996 and sport angling has not been allowed since 1999. A multi-agency study of habitat, fish migration and abundance is currently underway (CMAC 2000). Manitoba reduced its possession limit of lake sturgeon to zero in 1995. The remaining few commercial fisheries closed down during the 1990s but catch and release angling is still allowed in addition to aboriginal subsistence fishing in most rivers. Lake sturgeon population management has been initiated in several Manitoba rivers with involvement of First Nations communities. <br/> <br/>In Ontario, a Lake Sturgeon Assessment Program has been implemented for Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair, including population abundance estimation and tagging to identify movements and verify ages. As enough information is developed a management plan for the species will be drafted. Commercial catch quotas of lake sturgeon were established in 1984 and were adjusted periodically - through never achieved. In 1997, the catch quotas amounted to 1,500 kg in Lake St. Clair and 13,124 kg in Lake Huron. Huron catch that year was 5,471 kg, the highest of the previous several years. <br/> <br/>Quebec allows the harvest of lake sturgeon with 19â20.3 cm mesh gill nets only during an open season of 14 June through 31 October. A minimum fish length is in effect and quotas are enforced by the requirement that all fish for market must be tagged, and the tag must stay with the fish until it is processed. Quebec sport fishermen may catch and keep one fish per day.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
13042842,233,Acipenser medirostris,Near Threatened,,2006,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Acipenser medirostris</em> nearly meets Vulnerable under criterion A2c. Although the estimated population size is above the thresholds for any of the categories for threat, it is not large (34,000â166,000 adults and sub-adults) and the number of mature individuals is unknown.  The estimated number of spawning females for the Klamath River (which supports most of the northern DPS) is only 760â1,500 per year. However, four out of seven (57%) of the known spawning locations have been lost within the last three generations for reasons, not all of which are clearly understood, and may not have ceased or reversible. <br/> <br/>Green Sturgeon are not subjected to overfishing and habitat fragmentation that have affected other sturgeon species. There are active fisheries restrictions in place throughout the speciesâ range in the U.S. and Canada. <br/> <br/>The current adultâsubadult population size is estimated at least in the tens of thousands and there is no evidence of overall population decline, although four of the seven known spawning locations may have been lost. Considerable research is underway or planned to fill in information gaps on stock structure, abundance and migrations.  Although Green Sturgeon currently does not warrant ""threatened"" status under U.S. Endangered Species Act, concerns remain about the limited number of spawning rivers, potential growth of fisheries, and persistent habitat threats from water withdrawals and agricultural pesticides. Given the speciesâ life history characteristics and limited number of spawning sites, it is considered likely that the species would quickly move into a threatened category if current conservation efforts were withdrawn. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.","The Green Sturgeon is among the most marine oriented and widespread of the sturgeons. Like most sturgeons, the Green Sturgeon is characterized by large size, longevity, delayed maturation, high fecundity, and far-ranging movements. Green Sturgeon reach sizes up to 2.7 m and have been aged to over 50 years (Nakamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995, Farr <em>et al</em>. 2002). Mortality rates of subadults and adults are low and probably do not exceed 10% per year from natural causes based on age frequency analysis.  Males typically mature at about 15â17 years and 1.5â1.8 m, while females typically mature at 20â25 years and 1.8â2.1 m (Van Eenennaam and Doroshov  2001a). Similarly aged males are generally smaller than females with males from the northern DPS achieving a maximum size of 168 cm, while sexually mature males and females from the southern DPS range in size from 139 to199 cm and 157 to 223 cm, respectively (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Spawning is believed to occur every 3-5 years and the generation time is 27â33 years (Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Green Sturgeon are oviparious broadcast spawners and adult Green Sturgeon typically migrate into freshwater beginning in late February and spawning occurs in April to June in deep, turbulent river mainstems (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Klamath and Rogue River populations appear to spawn within 160 km of the ocean while the Sacramento population may travel over 320 km upriver. Green Sturgeon eggs and larvae are comparatively larger than those of other sturgeon species. For example, Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported a egg diameter of 4.34, 3.40 and 2.62 mm for green, white, and Atlantic Sturgeon (<em>A. oxyrinchus</em>) respectfully indicating that Green Sturgeon have eggs which have a volume twice that of white and over four times that of Atlantic Sturgeon. Consequently, Green Sturgeon have a relatively lower fecundity in comparison to other similar sized sturgeon species as reproductive energy is more heavily invested in egg size rather than egg number (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001b, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000). Fecundity varies with age and size, but has been estimated to be in the order of  2,800 eggs per kilogram bodyweight; approximately half that of White Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser transmontanus</em>) at 5,648 eggs per kilogram bodyweight (Moyle 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The eggs do not form a thick jelly coat as do those of other North American sturgeon and exhibit poor adhesion to substrate (Deng 2000, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000), which would indicate sensitivity to turbidity loading  (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1994, Moyle 2002). Furthermore, the larger eggs and higher growth rates of developing Green Sturgeon in comparison to other North American sturgeons suggests that a higher oxygen demand may be required for proper embryonic development; thus Green Sturgeon may require colder, cleaner water for spawning. (USFWS 1995).
<br/>
<br/>Eggs hatch in 7 to 9 days at 15Â°C (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that temperatures above 20Â°C are lethal to embryos and temperatures above 24Â°C significantly reduce five-day larval growth rates. Larvae begin to feed at 10 days post hatch and complete metamorphosis into juveniles at 45 days (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Juvenile Green Sturgeon grow rapidly reaching 60 cm within 2â3 years and they spend 1â4 years in fresh and estuarine waters before dispersal to saltwater (Beamsesderfer and Webb 2002). Green Sturgeon are commonly observed in bays and estuaries up and down the coast and large concentrations enter the Columbia River estuary, and Washington's Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay during late summer (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Limited tagging studies show that tagged individuals from the Columbia River have been recaptured off the west coast of Vancouver Island (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>During the 1 to 4 years of freshwater residence, juveniles gradually move to deeper and more saline areas as they grow (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). As juveniles grow, they exhibit greater tolerance to salinity and achieve seawater tolerance at seven months or sooner (Allen and Cech 2003). Adults return to freshwater to spawn, and Green Sturgeon have been reported to spawn up to 160 km upstream in the Klamath and Rogue rivers, and over 300 km upstream in the Sacramento River (Beamesderder and Webb 2002). After spawning, they to sea in late autumn to early winter when temperatures drop below 10Â°C and flows increased above 100 m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Juveniles are opportunistic benthic feeders with a diet consisting of various invertebrates and fish (EPIC 2001, Moyle 2002).  Stomach content analysis indicates that adult Green Sturgeon have a marine diet consisting of various benthic invertebrates including shrimp, crabs, worms, amphioids, and isopods (EPIC 2001), but have also been observed feeding on sand lances (<em>Ammodytes hexapterus</em>) and other fish.","Sturgeon exhibit a combination of morphology, life history and habitat requirements that make them highly susceptible to negative impacts from human activities (Boreman 1997).  Anthropogenic activities known to impact sturgeon include: exploitation   blockage of available freshwater spawning habitat through diking, damming causing inadequate flow regimes, channelization, elimination of backwater areas, dewatering of streams, destruction of thermal refugia, loss of deep pools, inundation of habitat by reservoirs, and exposure to bioaccumulating industrial and municipal pollution, (Boreman 1997, EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The long life span and late age of maturity makes sturgeon vulnerable to chronic and acute effects of bioaccumulation. White Sturgeon, for example have been found to have the greatest contaminant concentrations compared to salmonids, suckers, Walleye (<em>Sander vitreus</em>), Pacific Lamprey (<em>Lampetra tridentata</em>), and Eulachon (<em>Thaleichthys pacificus</em>), [USEPA 1999]. Whole body concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (19 Å³g/kg), DDT (787 Å³g/kg), p,pâDDE (620 Å³g/kg), Aroclors (173 Å³g/kg), and dioxins were an order of magnitude higher in concentration than all other species tested.  Although Green Sturgeon are less exposed to anthropogenic contaminants due to their marine migratory phase, there is the potential for exposure when entering freshwater to spawn and during estuarine concentrations. <br/> <br/>Marine and estuarine environments in Canada are of concern as they are heavily impacted by a number of activities including logging, aquaculture, agriculture and urbanization, and can be the eventual sinks to freshwater pollutants. However, a 1994 assessment of the quality of the lower Fraser River ecosystem indicated that no dramatic changes in species assemblages were determined to have occurred since the previous study in 1974 (Healey <em>et al</em>. 1994) despite an increase in usage. Area managed for conservation also increased from 23 to 69% over the same time period with 80% of the increase being accounted for by conservation efforts on the Fraser River estuary (MWLAP 2002). The increase in estuary protection and the results from Healey <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggests that estuarine habitat loss that may effect Green Sturgeon is likely not substantial in Canada. <br/> <br/>In the US, where all known spawning populations occur, Green Sturgeon have lost spawning habitat to poor land use practices and habitat alteration through water management projects (EPIC 2001). This has caused a decline in general water quality in some areas through increased sedimentation as well as the loss of deep pools which Green Sturgeon are known to prefer. Furthermore, damming of river systems can block previously available spawning habitat, affect natural flow regimes, potentially reduce areas of thermal refugia, and change sediment transport characteristics of the river which may cascade and impact sturgeon by modifying ecosystem community structure (EPIC 2001). For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). <br/> <br/>Beamesderfer and Webb (2002 suggest that habitat conditions throughout the Green Sturgeon range have stabilized or are improving, but the results of spawning surveys have yet to substantiate that (NMFS 2002). Most of the northern population segment spawns in the Klamath River. Potential threats to this population include concentration of spawning, harvest (especially in mixed-stock estuarine fisheries), and loss of spawning habitat such as the Columbia River, and the Eel and South Fork, and Trinity Rrivers in California (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The southern population segment (south of the Eel River) is more of a concern because it has fewer spawners (limited to the Sacramento-San Joaquin system), which makes it more susceptible to catastrophic events. These fish also face potentially lethal temperature limits, entrainment by water projects, and may be adversely affected by pesticides and other toxic substances and exotic species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is probable that Green Sturgeon spawning habitat has been lost behind dams and water diversions throughout the Central Valley (e.g., Red Bluff Diversion Dam and Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District pumping plant). <br/> <br/><strong>Utilisation</strong> <br/>Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in two three fisheries. The smaller bycatch occurs in Klamath River Tribal salmon gill net fisheries while the larger portion is in the White Sturgeon commercial and sport fisheries (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). Total annual harvest of Green Sturgeon declined substantially to 1,192 fish in 1999â2001 from 6,871 fish in 1985â1989. Most of this earlier harvest came from the Columbia River (51%) and Washington coastal fisheries (28%). In recent years, Columbia and Washington coastal harvest was substantially reduced and in 2001 these two bycatch fisheries and that of the Klamath River tribes were about equal in number. Catch reduction in the Columbia River is a result of increasingly restrictive regulations. For the sturgeon sport fishery, slot limits prohibit retention of fish (white or green) less than 107 cm (42 inches) or more than 152 cm (60 inches). Green Sturgeon retained as bycatch in the commercial fishery must be between 122 and 168 cm (48-66 inches). <br/> <br/>Klamath Tribal fisheries (Yurok and Hoopa) accounted for an average 266 adult fish annually from 1986â2001 with no apparent trend. This fishery is monitored but not regulated. California sport catch of Green Sturgeon, primarily in San Pablo Bay, is not monitored, but is thought to be only a few fish each year (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). California slot size limits for both sturgeon species is 117â183 cm (46â72 inches). <br/> <br/>There is also a bycatch in the domestic trawl fishing industry in B.C., which takes about 171 Green Sturgeon annually (Davis 2004). <br/> <br/>There is no information on the extent of illegal exploitation of Green Sturgeon, but poaching activity on White Sturgeon in the lower Fraser River is a concern (Ptolemy and Vennesland 2003).","Preliminary population genetics results suggest that Green Sturgeon from the Klamath and Rogue rivers are similar to each other but distinct from fish from San Pablo Bay. Green Sturgeon commonly occur in the lower Columbia River (OregonâWashington) and genetic samples taken there appear to be a mixture of the other populations (Israel <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS 2003) has determined that, based on genetic evidence of discreteness, there are two Distinct Population Segments (DPS's) for Green Sturgeon. The northern population ranges from the Eel River, California, to at least the Rogue River, Oregon. The southern population is principally comprised of the Sacramento River spawning stock.
<br/>
<br/>Their wide distribution, large numbers observed seasonally in some areas, and projections based on demographic rates suggest that total Green Sturgeon numbers are at least in the tens of thousands (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). The largest known spawning stock of Green Sturgeon is that of the Klamath River and its tributary, the Trinity River. The Klamath River population is estimated to number up to 66,000 individuals of which 3,000 would be mature adults. Actual spawner numbers in the Klamath were estimated at 760â1,500 females per year based on average harvest and total mortality rates (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Based on a review of recent tagging studies, harvest analyses, and stock assessments from many locations, Beamesderfer and Webb (2002) estimated that the total adult and subadult population size of Green Sturgeon is within the range of 34,000 to 160,000 fish. Of these, greatest abundance was recorded for the Columbia River estuary, and ocean and bay waters of Oregon and Washington.
<br/>
<br/>Attempts to determine trends in sturgeon abundance in the northern DPS have been inconclusive regarding the status of Green Sturgeon, and the status of the northern Green Sturgeon population is unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Similar attempts to determine the status of Green Sturgeon in the southern DPS were also inconclusive, and with the exception of anecdotal evidence of a reduction of Green Sturgeon entrainment at water export facilities indicative of a population decline, the status of the southern DPS is also unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).",Stable,"Green Sturgeon is an anadromous species that spend most of their life in near-shore marine and estuarine waters from Mexico to southeast Alaska (Houston 1988, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Large concentrations of Green Sturgeon are still found in coastal estuaries, but their range in freshwater has been restricted by damming in some rivers. For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). Spawning is presently known to occur in only three rivers in North America, all of which are in the United States: the Rogue River in Oregon (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Rien <em>et al</em>. 2001), and the Klamath and Sacramento river systems in California (EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002, CDFG 2002, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1992,1994).  Spawning populations have been extirpated from the San Joaquin, Eel, South Fork, and Trinity rivers, and possibly the Umpqua River (EPIC 2001, NMFS 2002). Seasonal concentrations occur in several estuaries including the Sacramento-San Joaquin, Eel, Columbia, Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor and the Fraser River (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Fishery managers in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia have recognized the sensitivity of Green Sturgeon to fishing and have actively restricted commercial and sport fisheries everywhere Green Sturgeon occur. None of the reviews examined mentioned any legal, regional, national or international trade in Green Sturgeon products. This species is not considered as good to eat as White Sturgeon and markets for their flesh are limited. <br/> <br/>Due to life history characteristics that make it particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events Green Sturgeon has a designation of ""Special Concern"" in Canada (Houston 1988, Davies 2004), and no harvest is allowed in Canadian waters. <br/> <br/>In response to a petition to list Green Sturgeon under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a status review for this species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). NMFS determined that the species is comprised of two distinct population segments (DPS) but that neither warrants listing as a threatened or endangered species at this time (NMFS 2003). However, because of remaining uncertainties about their population structure and status, both DPS populations were added to the agency's list of candidate species and will be reevaluated in five years provided sufficient new information becomes available.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

This species was historically recorded in southwestern Korea and in western Kyushu, Japan and in the Yellow, Yangtze, Pear, Mingjiang, and Qingtang rivers in China, but has been extirpated from all of these areas except for the mid-lower section of the Yangtze River, below the Gezhouba dam. This species was historically overfished. In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals, but between 2005-2007 the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was estimated to be 203-257 individuals. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period. The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 blocked the migration routes of this species, making it impossible for it to reach spawning sites in the upper reaches of the river. Currently, there is just one remaining spawning ground (a 4 km stretch of river), which is situated below the Gezhouba dam. Furthermore, in 2003, the Three Gorges dam was constructed 40 km upstream of the Gezhouba dam. This has changed the hydrological regime (lowering the water level of the river in autumn and winter) and affected the water temperature. Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles (including larvae) were released into Yangtze River to increase population numbers, but the contribution to wild stocks is considered to be less than 10%. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.","This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Young of this species live in estuarine and nearshore habitats. When the species becomes sexually mature, it migrates up-river. Nearly mature adults (early stage III) arrive at the mouth of the Yangtze River in June or July. The adults do not feed while in the river. <br/><br/>Adults reach the middle sections of the river in September or October, where they overwinter. Ripe individuals were formerly found as far inland as the Jingsha River during the following October and November, where they spawned. Prior to construction of the Gezhouba Dam, the migration distance was as long as 2,500 to 3,300 km. Spawning sites often occur in turbulent sections of the river with rocky substrate and steep cliffs on both banks.<br/><br/>The roe is very large and it sinks and sticks to gravel until hatching.

Individuals from 25 to 250 kg in weight were registered in some fishing grounds of East China Sea and Yellow Sea. This species attains a length of more than 3 metres.","This species has been historically overfished. In the 1970s, fishing was unlimited, but seasonal (occurring mostly between October and November). Gear types include gill nets (upper reach) and row hooks (middle reach).&#160; Due to its life history characteristics, once depleted, stocks of this species take a long time to recover. Fry are also captured by traditional Chinese fishing methods (drift nets in the river and set nets at the river mouth).<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation, alteration, destruction and changes to hydrological conditions also significantly impacts this species. The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 blocked the migration routes of this species, making it impossible for it to reach&#160; spawning sites in the upper reaches of the river. Currently, there is just one remaining spawning ground, which is situated below the Gezhouba dam.<br/><br/>In 2003, the Three Gorges dam was constructed 40 km upstream of the Gezhouba dam.

Synthetic chemicals in water could contribute to the population decline of this species by significantly decreasing both the quality and quantity of eggs and spawning frequency of fish (Hu 2009).","In the 1960s, this stock supported a major commercial fishery, but catches in the late 1970s had declined to about 500 fish per year (The Changjiang Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).<br/><br/>In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals. In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba dam isolated the upper reaches of the Yangtze river. In 1983 and 1984, the mean spawning stock size was estimated at 2,176 individuals (946 and 4,169 as 95% confidence intervals). Available data from acoustic surveys show that between 2005 and 2007, the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was 203-257. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period.<br/><br/>During 1996-2001, studies using tag-recapture methods, population structure analysis and sonar counting indicated that the spawning stock in the Yichang spawning area (mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze river) had decreased since the completion of the Gezhouba Dam. Annual estimates of spawning adults within the 40 km (including the 4km long spawning area) ranged from 199 to 473 (Chang 1999, Wei 2003).<br/><br/>Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles were released into Yangtze River to increase wild stocks. Prior to 1996, only the larvae were released as techniques had not been developed to cultivate fry, so survivability is expected to be very low (Wei 200, Chen 2008).

We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bearâs reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (LÃ¸nÃ¸ 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of â¥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (MolnÃ¡r <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross humanâanimal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naÃ¯ve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiolÂ­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contamÂ­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Ãritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Ãritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bearâs range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccessÂ­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the inÂ­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the populaÂ­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and ecoÂ­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governmentsâ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to preÂ­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of humanâbear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of humanâbear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a âmore crowdedâ Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term âmanagement unitsâ may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, MolnÃ¡r <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (MâClintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89Â°46âN, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52Â°35âN (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bearsâ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party ââ¦shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,â¦â and according to Article VII, âThe Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bearsâ¦â and&#160; â...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...â. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation.

19034321,184092,Notropis topeka,Least Concern,,2014,2012-07-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern because the species does not meet the criteria for any of the threatened categories: extent of occurrence exceeds 20,000 sq km, area of occupancy likely is more than 2,000 sq km, number of locations exceeds 10, and distribution is not severely fragmented. Distribution and abundance probably are declining but not at a rate of more than 30 percent over 10 years or three generations. However, the species has a restricted, shrinking range, and&#160;projected climate change and other factors could move the species closer to the Vulnerable category in the foreseeable future.","This species typically inhabits quiet, open, permanent pools of small, clear, high-quality headwaters and creeks that drain upland prairie areas, including tiny spring-fed pools in headwater streams and larger streams (Gorman pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Streams that have been channelized or impounded or that drain cultivated fields generally are not suitable habitat (Schrank <em>et al</em>. 2001, Gorman pers. comm., Prophet pers. comm.). Many occupied streams become intermittent in the summer but the pools are maintained by springs. Habitat includes off-channel sites in Minnesota and Iowa, (primarily cut-off channels and oxbows that are seasonally flooded (Hatch pers. comm. 1999, Menzel, Iowa State University pers. comm. 1999); these sites probably connect with the water table, which probably keep temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations within tolerance levels during hot, dry periods and prevent total freeze-out of pools in winter. Streams may or may not be bordered by trees (Gorman pers. comm.). Riffles are occupied only if shiners are exceptionally abundant in a local area (Minckley and Cross 1959). Pool substrate is gravel, rubble, or sand, often with a slight silt layer (Kerns unpublished data); usually does not occur in pools with large amounts of silt on the bottom (Minckley and Cross 1959), but in the South Fork of the Cottonwood River, Kansas, the larger pools containing Topeka Shiners had several centimetres of silt (Kerns unpublished data). The pools usually do not have rooted aquatic vegetation but many have plankton blooms during the summer (Minckley and Cross 1959, Kerns, unpublished data). In Kansas streams, the Topeka shiner is pelagic, occupying the lower half of the water column (Kerns unpublished data), though Tabor (1993) stated that this fish occurs in mid-water and surface areas.&#160;<br/>Temperatures of occupied waters vary from near freezing in winter to 90Â°F (32Â°C) in summer (Gorman pers. comm.).Oxygen levels are generally near saturation (Gorman pers. comm.). The water may range from clear to murky (from plankton blooms or suspended fine clay particles when the water is very warm) (Gorman pers. comm.). Occupied streams do not have a strong continuous flow; the flow is usually less than five cubic feet per second (Minckley and Cross 1959). <br/><br/>The male has a small territory around Green Sunfish (<em>Lepomis cyanellus</em>) or Orange-spotted Sunfish (<em>L. humilis</em>) nests. Spawning occurs over the sunfish nests. Juveniles remain in the shallow margins of pools in mixed-species groups during their first summer.","The major threats include land and water practices that alter the physical and biological characteristics of streams. This fish is fairly resistant to natural, short-term stresses but sensitive to permanent changes in habitat such as reduced water quality and increased water temperature. <br/><br/>Detrimental land practices, such as cultivation, clearcut logging, building projects, and intensive, continuous grazing, increase the amount of silt and sediment in streams (Platts 1979, Gorman pers. comm., Pflieger pers. comm.). Sedimentation in streams reduces instream cover, covers fish eggs, and covers food-producing gravel and rubble (Platts 1979). <br/><br/>Grazing livestock can directly damage a stream by eating stream-edge vegetation and trampling that causes erosion, and through defecation that pollutes water (Tabor pers. comm).<br/><br/>Several types of water projects can eliminate shiner populations. Channelization can alter the water temperature and flow rates and change the stream morphology. The lowering of the water table level is drying out some streams (Gorman pers. comm.). The building of impoundments stocked with predatory game fishes is a major threat in some areas (Schrank <em>et al</em>. 2001) because the shiners are eaten by the predators and because impoundment alter stream hydrology and act as barriers to fish dispersal (Cross pers. comm., Kerns pers. comm.). Construction of impoundments recently threatened the largest remaining populations in Kansas (Tabor 1993); threat of watershed dams persists but is now diminished since dams are not allowed to be constructed where Topeka Shiner populations are known.<br/><br/>Recent collections in Missouri revealed that some populations are afflicted with scoliosis, which causes deformities; the cause of the condition is not yet known.<br/><br/>Competition with the introduced blackstripe topminnow is a potential threat in some areas, but the significance of this is undocumented. <br/><br/>Predation by non-native fishes may be one of the factors that reduce Topeka Shiner abundance (Knight and Gido 2005).<br/><br/>USFWS (2009) summarized/updated threats information as follows:<br/><br/>In the northern portions of the range, the species continues to exist across nearly all of its historic range despite widespread land-cover and land-use changes. Ongoing and future threats to the habitat have been identified; however these threats are not believed to be meaningfully impacting the species' status in the northern portions of the range at this time. No threats in this portion of the range are thought to currently exceed a moderate overall threat level. While the species appears less vulnerable to known threats in this portion of the range, projected impacts to habitat may meaningfully impact water quantity and the suitability of stream habitat within the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Long-term habitat degradations resulting from historical changes in landcover and land-use are still believed to be the major contributing factors in the long-term decline of Topeka Shiner across the southern portions of the range. Many of the threats from this long-term degradation are still current and have continued to impact the species and its habitat since listing. Within the southern portions of the range, threats to habitat are substantially more severe than in the northern portions of the range.<br/><br/>Overall, the threat of disease remains poorly understood, but is believed a minor issue except when habitat conditions are compromised. Predation by non-native fishes is considered a low level threat in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa and a moderate to high level threat in Kansas and Missouri. Predation is poorly understood in Nebraska.<br/><br/>Current federal regulatory oversight has minimized many impacts across the range. However, current federal oversight has not been sufficient to prevent the species' continued decline and loss in some areas. Such continued losses have largely been limited to the southern portion of its range where threats appear more severe and habitat appears more susceptible to detrimental changes.<br/><br/>Much of the remaining range of the Topeka Shiner in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska consists of highly fragmented, isolated populations with long distances of altered or unsuitable habitat between them, prohibiting redistribution. Many of these populations do not have the necessary downstream or off-channel refuges available to them to survive long-term drought conditions at this time. Increased periods of protracted drought, potentially resulting from climate change, would exacerbate the impacts of habitat fragmentation and isolation. Increased drought could also impact presently stable population complexes, forcing these populations to seek refuge downstream into larger streams with more predatory fishes and diminished habitat value. This threat is applicable to both the northern and southern portions of the Topeka Shiner's current range.<br/><br/>If climate change  projections prove accurate, the long-term impacts to Topeka Shiner could be substantial. Impacts in summer are of particular concern. Increased air temperatures will lead to higher water temperatures, especially during low-flow periods. Reduced summer precipitation and increased evaporation is likely to reduce flows. Such conditions cause increased stress to fish. The timing and amount of precipitation will also impact groundwater recharge rates. Finally, substantially hotter summers would likely increase agricultural demand for surface-water and ground-water resources. Thus, the available information indicates climate change is a substantial long-term risk factor which could meaningfully impact water quantity and the suitability of stream habitat.","Recent surveys have added many new occurrences and large expansions of known range in South Dakota and Minnesota (USFWS 2009).<br/><br/>USFWS (2009) mapped eight patches of occupied habitat; the only large ones were in South Dakota-Minnesota and Kansas.<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but probably exceeds 10,000. In the southern part of the range, this fish is generally uncommon even in suitable habitat (Page and Burr 1991, Lee <em>et al</em>. 1980). It is more numerous in the north (USFWS 2009).<br/><br/>Distribution and abundance have declined, but the extent of the decline is less than previously thought (USFWS 2009). <br/><br/>Trend over the past 10 years or three generations is uncertain, but distribution and abundance probably are slowly declining. Trend varies across range: relatively stable in the northern portion of the range, generally declining in the central and southern parts of the range (USFWS 2009).",Decreasing,"This species formerly was widespread in western tributaries of the Mississippi River, from central Missouri through Iowa to southern Minnesota, west to eastern South Dakota, western Nebraska, and western Kansas (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 1982, Vandel 1982, USFWS 2009).

The species is presumed to have suffered  substantial direct mortality and loss of habitat during the wildfires.  The preceding drought created conditions for the wildfires and may have  impacted indirectly on <em>P. papuensis</em> through reduced prey availability,  water availability and impacts to thermoregulatory efficiency.<br/><br/>The proportion of its area of occupancy (AOO) that burnt in 2019/20 is 40.88%. The AOO is already small at 2,128 kmÂ²,  therefore any losses are significant.

Further post-fire surveys for <em>P. papuensis </em>are  currently underway across its range in NSW. So far, the species has not  been re-trapped in areas where it was previously recorded in the Coffs  Harbour hinterlands and north of Dorrigo. In northern NSW, <em>P. papuensis</em>  was trapped in high, low and unburnt areas, although numbers were lower  in the burnt areas compared to previous trapping results. Whilst it is  too early for this study to shed information on the magnitude of the  impact of the fires, areas with extensive high severity burns from the  2019-2020 wildfire are expected to have reduced <em>P. papuensis</em> numbers.<br/><br/>Wildfire  associated with extreme heat events will be an ongoing threat to this  species, the impacts will be long term, unlikely to be reversible, and  is predicted to increase in frequency and intensity (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2019). Such events cause change to this speciesâ preferred habitat and/or impact directly on individuals.<br/><br/>This  species is listed as Vulnerable in New South Wales. It is not currently  listed as threatened in Queensland or federally, however, due to the  impact of the recent wildfires this warrants a reassessment.","This medium-sized (Churchill 2008), nocturnal insectivorous bat  specialises on foraging on spiders from the family Araneida (Schulz and  Wainer 1997) which it plucks from webs often on the mid to upper slopes  of sclerophyll forests (Schulz 2000a, Law and Chidel 2004). It doesnât  venture far from its roosts, which are almost always in the nests of the  yellow-throated scrub-wren and to a lesser extent the brown gerygone  (<em>Gerygone mouki</em>, Schulz 2000b, Law and Chidel 2004). These nests occur  in rainforest lined gullies, where the species seems to prefer those in  the more cluttered smaller orders (Schulz and Eyre 2000). With broad  wings and large tail, <em>P. papuensis </em>is capable of hovering and highly  manoeuvrable flight (Rhodes 1995).","This species is dependent on rainforested gullies containing  yellow-throated scrub-wren (<em>Sericornis citreogularis</em>) nests for roosting  and forested mid to upper slopes for foraging. As a result, it is  threatened by habitat alteration from development, agriculture and  logging, and changes to vegetation type from climate change and  associated droughts and fires. The proportion of the species habitat  that burnt in the 2019/20 Australian fires is 40.88%. In New South Wales (NSW), these  fires burnt over or within 500 m of 523 <em>P. papuensis </em>records (from 1324  records), directly impacting 40% of known records in this state (using  FESMv2.1 fire extent and severity modelling).

Such events cause change to this speciesâ preferred habitat and/or impact directly on individuals.<br/><br/>Feral  cats are present in rainforests of Australia and with its slow and  hovering flight,<em> P. papuensis</em> may be susceptible to additional predation  pressure from introduced predators (Duncan <em>et al.</em> 1999). It is  indirectly impacted by changes in prey abundance or temperature shifts  that may cause disruption to its thermoregulatory requirements.<br/><br/>The  threats to the species outside of Australia are less well known but  assumed to be drought, logging and wood harvesting, invasive species  (fire ants) and land clearing for agriculture.","The population size of <em>P. papuensis</em> is unknown. Across its entire  biogeographical range, it is likely that over 10,000 individuals exist  based on extent of occurrence and generally low numbers of individuals  trapped at any one time.

Within this specialised habitat, this  species has a patchy distribution and was absent from ecologically  diverse riparian forests with abundant surface water (Law and Anderson 1999).<br/><br/>This small bat displays morphological adaptations for  foraging over water by having long, pointed wings with slightly high  aspect ratio and low wing loading (Norberg and Rayner 1987, Jones and  Rayner 1991, Campbell 2011), as well as large feet to rake the surface  of the water for aquatic prey (Campbell 2011, Law <em>et al.</em> 2020).  Dietary analysis identified a diet dominated by aquatic insects and to a  lesser extent, fish (Jones and Rayner 1991, Law and Urquhart 2000).  The distribution of the species has been affected by heavy metal  contamination and sediment pollution (Clarke-Wood <em>et al.</em> 2016, Gonsalves and Law 2017). <br/><br/><em>Myotis  macropus </em>roosts in tree hollows in riparian vegetation located within  100 m of permanent water (Campbell 2009). This species has also been  recorded roosting in caves, and in artificial structures like tunnels  and bridges also within 100 m of permanent water (Richards <em>et al.</em>  2008, Campbell 2009, Law et al. 2020). This species is found in urban  environments where it has been recorded roosting in jetties (Gonsalves  and Law 2017) and road culverts (Gorecki <em>et al.</em> 2020). A study on  culvert roost availability found these roost types were limited, and  this may restrict the speciesâ distribution and abundance in urban  environments, whilst increasing their vulnerability to roost disturbance  (Gorecki <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/>Females form maternity colonies from October  to March, giving birth to a single pup two to three times per breeding  season (Dwyer 1970, Lloyd <em>et al.</em> 1999, Gorecki <em>et al.</em> 2020). Dispersal  distances are unknown for this species, however, it has been tracked  foraging up to 22 km from roost sites (Campbell 2009). Population  structure has been identified between populations 12â15 km apart  (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2009, Law <em>et al.</em> 2020), and female genetic relatedness  was not detected beyond 30 km, indicating restricted gene flow between  even geographically close populations (VGorecki, unpublished data).","This species is spatially restricted due to its association with aquatic habitats, which are highly susceptible to changes in water quality caused by sedimentation, chemical pollutants, and altered flow regimes (Clarke-Wood <em>et al.</em> 2016, Gonsalves and Law 2017). Changes in water quality may further restrict this speciesâ distribution through the reduction in suitable foraging grounds. Roosting colonies are threatened by disturbance to roost sites, particularly in culverts and bridges during maternity season. Disturbance to maternity colonies has the potential to impact survival and breeding success. The loss of artificial roost sites has the potential to restrict the speciesâ distribution and abundance in urban environments due to the limited availability of suitable artificial roosts (Gorecki <em>et al.</em> 2020). Many hollow-bearing trees along riparian corridors were destroyed during the extensive 2019/20 wildfires, and water quality may have been affected.","Population size is expected to be greater than 10,000 mature individuals based on the extent of occurrence although population densities vary across its distribution (Law and Anderson 1999, Campbell 2011).

Consequently it is assessed as Least Concern.","Maternity colonies roost in tree hollows, spaces under the loose bark  and bat-boxes, crevices in buildings and bridges, frequently in cattle  stables as well as in hollow blocks. The colony usually consists of  30-80 individuals. In buildings, however, they can also be more numerous  (up to 200 females). As many other woodland bats, it is prone to  frequent change of roosts (1-2 times a week). Male colonies of up to 30  animals also occupy tree cavities, bat and bird boxes and buildings. It  hibernates in underground habitats (caves, cellars and mines), usually  solitary or in small clusters of 2-5 individuals (Simon <em>et al.</em>  2012). The best known hibernation site is Nietoperek fortification  system in Poland with more than 300 recorded hibernating bats (EUROBATS  2019).<br/>It hunts over a variety of habitats such as meadows, pastures,  orchards, broadleaved woods, open coniferous forests and riparian  areas. Intense foraging was observed inside cattle sheds. Feeding areas  range between 128 and 580 ha. The core of a feeding area can be up to 4  km away from the roost and individuals are faithful to them, returning  there regularly. Commuting routes between the roost and the core area  are also utilised for foraging. In a German study, the average distance  between maternity roosts and feeding areas was 1.5 km.M. nattereri can  capture prey on the wing and by gleaning resting insects from the  surface of vegetation using the tail membrane and/or feet. The chief  components of its diet are Diptera and Coleoptera, especially Brachycera  and Curculionidae. Diurnally active insects, insects which rarely fly  and non-flying arthropods are also eaten (see the literature review in  KyherÃ¶inen <em>et al.</em> 2019). Faecal pellets collected at a  hibernation site in southern England for two winters, indicated that <em>M.  nattereri</em> forages throughout winter on non-volant Aranea, Isopoda and  Lepidoptera (Hope <em>et al.</em> 2014). Movements between summer, autumn  and winter roosts up to 185 km were recorded (Schober, Grimmberger  1998). The maximum known longevity for males and females was 21,5 and  17,5 years respectively (Ohlendorf 2002, Topal 2011).","Major threats in Europe are as follow (Simon <em>et al.</em> 2012):  Habitat and roost loss due to abandonment of cattle husbandry (stable  housing). Enlargement of crops leading to the destruction of  small-scale, insect-rich cultivated landscapes. Insect loss due to the  intensive agriculture, forestry and use of pesticides, also in livestock  farming. Reduction of summer and winter roosts' availability due to  forest operations (removal of deadwood and old trees with cavities),  renovation of buildings, bridges, cattle stables etc. Disappearance of  small waters in the forest and in the country. Loss of hibernacula due  to collapse, closing or conversion of e.g. ice cellars, bunkers and  other underground habitats.Disturbances (noise, vandalism) in the winter  quarters.The species is sensitive to light pollution (Voigt <em>et al.</em> 2018).

For this reason the species is listed Vulnerable due to an ongoing population decline, suspected to be greater than 30%, over a period of three generations (21 years) considering both the past (10 years) and future (11 years) suspected from loss of primary habitat.","Originally found in montane forests and paramos at altitudes between 1,000 and 3,500 m asl in  mountain chains and massifs crossing over Venezuela (Zulia, Tachira, Apure, Merida, and Trujillo) and Colombia (La Guajira, Cesar, Norte de Santander, Santander, Boyaca). Linares (1998) reports <em>M. bricenii</em> as present on the eastern flank of Perija massive based on animal body parts that he collected at 3,100 m in Cerro Viruela near Pico Tetari. Thus, it is highly probable that the species also occupies paramos on the Colombian side of Perija.  <br/><br/>The main habitat of <em>M. bricenii</em> is paramos and tropical montane cloud forests above 1,500 m. The paramos are high altitude grasslands (Boom <em>et al.</em> 2001), which are dominated by <em>Calamagrostis </em>spp. and gigantic Andean rosette plants from the genus Espeletia (Luteyn 1992). The tropical montane cloud forest is a type of vegetation that has special climatic conditions causing cloud and mist to be regularly in contact with the forest vegetation (Bruijnzeel and Veneklaas 1998). These forests support ecosystems of distinctive floristic and structural forms with lower canopy and thicker understory than lowland forests (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1963).

These events have been documented in all Amazonian Manatee range countries (Reeves<em> et al. </em>1996, Orozco 2001, Franzini 2008, Souza 2015), and this is now a major threat for the species (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>When calves survive drowning in nets, they may be kept alive for later sale<span lang=""EN-US""> as pets, kept in pools or areas close to water bodies, and sold or given to influential persons.

These elements are absorbed by aquatic weeds and may directly affect the staple diet of the species (Rosas 1994). Roots of floating and rooted aquatic plants (<em>Paspalum, Eicchornia, Salvinia</em>) have been shown to be important methylation sites (GuimarÃ£es <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Over 300 dams are planned for the Amazon (Winemiller <em>et al. </em>2016), two of which are mega-enterprises in Brazil (Madeira and Xingu rivers). The building of dams can interfere with habitat quality, altering water speed, nutrient load and dynamics of macrophyte production (Junk and Nunes de Mello 1987). Brazil has extensive plans for navigation (Fearnside 2001, Brazil, PR, 2011) with dams allowing the opening of the waterway in the Tapajos river (Fearnside 2015) planned for soy transport, giving access to the Amazon river and the Atlantic ocean (Brazil, PR 2011, Millikan 2011).&#160;Amazonian Manatees are very sensitive to noise, and intense boat traffic on the Amazonian rivers can affect their behaviour and habitat use.</p>  <p>Oil spills may be a particular problem in Ecuador (Brice <em>et al. </em>2011, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013, Brice 2014), where oil exploitation has been permitted in important refuges for the species (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013). The use of fertilizers and weed control products in extensive monocultures (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013), incidental captures in fishing nets, the use of dynamite, the increasing use of motorized boats including in the Cuyabeno and Jatuncocha systems where there are nature tourism activities (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, b) are additional threats in Ecuador.</p>  <p>On the Peru-Colombia border, wood extraction activities are clogging lakes and stopping normal migrations of Manatees in the Atacuari area (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p>Amazonian human populations are generally at low densities except in the large capital cities, but all of the issues above could be magnified by the increase in human population.</p><p>Tourism and transport are interfering more and more with low water resting places in the area around Puerto NariÃ±o (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>Around the city of BelÃ©m and estuary of the Amazon River, boat traffic is intense and even ferries and cargo ships may interfere with Manatee movement (Miranda LeÃ£o <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p><strong>Natural disasters, drought, climate change</strong></p><p>Extreme droughts may help make the Manatee an easier prey item for hunters, by causing isolation and entrapment. During the 2010 drought in the PiagaÃ§u-Purus SDR (Purus River, Brazil), 180 Manatees were estimated killed (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014), but only a few cases of Manatees trapped by drought in the eastern Peruvian frontier area were recorded, and none in Colombia (S.

Analysis of feeding patches, direct sightings of <em>T. inunguis</em> and interview surveys have been used to try to estimate population numbers with limited results, due to opportunistic sightings and small samples without standardized effort. Traditional mark-recapture studies are not appropriate due to the speciesâ secretive nature. More recently there have been efforts to estimate populations with the use of rotary or side-scan sonars, but still with inconclusive results (Brice 2014, Francisco <em>et al.</em> 2015), which hinders the development of conservation strategies for the species. Magor empirically estimated a minimum population of 10,000 Amazonian Manatees for the Amazon basin (Husar 1977). Based on the analysis of mtDNA control region, Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>(2005) suggested a genetic estimate of the effective female population size of <em>T. inunguis</em> of approximately 455,000 individuals, indicative of a recent large population size.

In the Colombian Amazon, the population may have stabilized, but hunting continues on the Peruvian side of the river and this affects the Colombian population. During 2010-2015, NatÃ¼tama registered 3 to 4 new calves every year in Colombia. Fishermen insist that there are more Manatees now, mainly because they see groups of 7 to 10 Manatees more often (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Systematic monitoring with former Manatee hunters recorded 364 sightings around Puerto NariÃ±o in 2014, including five different calves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Castelblanco-MartÃ­nez&#160;</span><em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2015).</p><p>A study conducted 1996-1999 in Cuyabeno Reserve (Ecuador) contradicted Timm <em>et al.</em>'s<em>&#160;</em>(1986) prediction of extinction in 10 years. However, relative abundance in Cuyabeno River was 0.01 animal / h effort and 0.007 animal / h effort in Lagartococha River. A total 40-49 animals were sighted in the Cuyabeno Reserve between 1996 and 1998, where they are considered rare (Denkinger 2010). The use of sonar produced estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 individuals / 10 km in three sites (Parque Nacional Yasuni, Lagartococha and Cocaya lake systems); no animals were detected in 58 km of the Cuyabeno lagoon system (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Brice (2014), using side-scan sonar observed 24 individuals in 70 hours of sampling in the same region. In Ecuador the species is considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria C2a(i), which indicates an estimated population of less than 250 mature individuals, and no subpopulation with 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2001).</p><p>GuzmÃ¡n (2014), also using a side scan sonar, recorded 14 Manatees in 65 km of rivers and lagoons, or 2.15 ind / 10 km in the Lagartococha river, on border Peru-Ecuador, an area partially surveyed by Utreras <em>et al. </em>(2013). Bodmer <em>et al. </em>(2006) believed the population in the Pacaya Samiria Reserve was stable due to a slight increase in counts between 2003 and 2006. However, Soto (2007) points out that the estimation method has not yet been proven.</p><p>In some sustainable development reserves (SDR) in Brazilian Amazon, hunting has been decreasing over the recent years. This is probably a reflection of the conservation actions that have occurred in the region, and the lack of interest among young fishermen for hunting the Manatee. The frequent records of sightings of adults and females with calves during the rainy and dry seasons in the PiagaÃ§u-Purus SDR (Souza 2015) suggest that populations of <em>T. inunguis</em> may be stable or increasing in these regions.</p><p>Sixty two per cent&#160;of hunters interviewed by Calvimontes (2009) in AmanÃ£ SDR (Brazil) believed the population is decreasing, although they attribute this to Manatees having moved away (due to habitat alterations and increasing levels of noise) rather than hunting. Calvimontes also reported that most hunters are turning into farmers, which should decrease the pressure on the species.&#160;Seventy three&#160;per cent of interviewees in the BelÃ©m region (mouth of the Amazon) considered the Manatee population is decreasing, due to hunting, pollution, boat traffic and noise (Miranda 2014). Half of the respondents in Franzini <em>et al.</em>'s&#160;(2013) study believed Manatee numbers are declining.</p><p>Seventy&#160;per cent&#160;of interviewees in the Ucayali region of Peru believed the population is decreasing (Silva <em>et al. </em>2014). In a preliminary survey of Manatees in the Lagartococha region, in 6.9 km of canoe transects Hidalgo (2010) observed 16 Manatees and 25 feeding patches, which lead him to evaluate that Manatees in the Lagartococha river basin may be stable due to the almost null human presence.</p><p>The progressive increase in the number of young calves arriving at rehabilitation centres in Brazil in the past five years has also led several researchers to suspect that the species may be undergoing some recovery, or that the increase is simply a reflection of the awareness campaigns implemented, with a concomitant increase in the number of rescued calves (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005). Alternatively, it may also suggest that calf takes are on the rise.</p><p>Although Manatees are widespread through a large area, there is a high level of uncertainty about population size, as no reliable method for determining abundance has been defined so far. Whatever the current population size, the overall population trend is most likely to be decreasing, given the speciesâ slow reproduction (sirenian populations grow at an annual rate of approximately 5-6%; Marsh<em> et al. </em>2004, 2011) and levels of exploitation (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 1992). In summary, although the population may be stabilizing in some parts of the Amazon region due to local awareness building and other conservation efforts, the overall trend is of a decreasing population.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Amazonian Manatees occur in northern South America, and are endemic to the Amazon Basin. Amazonian Manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, in river and lake systems, from the headwaters, in Colombia (Domning 1981), Ecuador (Timm <em>et al. </em>1986) and Peru (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1996) to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the MarajÃ³ Island) in Brazil (Best and Teixeira 1982, Miranda 2014) over an estimated seven million square kilometres. However, they are patchily distributed, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 kmÂ² (Junk 1997), but are limited by troubled waters (rapids and falls) and aquatic vegetation (Best 1983).</p>  <p>In Ecuador most records are from the extreme northeast, below 250 m altitude. From north to south there are records for the GÃ¼eppi river (tributary of Putumayo, in the border with Colombia), the Aguarico river and its Cuyabeno and Lagartococha systems, where most of the records come from (Denkinger 2010, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in tributaries such as the Yanayacu, Cocaya and Zancudococha lagoon; in the Napo region they are found in the AÃ±angu, Challuacocha and Yuturi lagoon systems, as well as in the Tiputini river and YasunÃ­ basin, including the Jatuncocha and Tambococha lagoon systems (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a). In Peru they occur in the Loreto region in the Samiria, Pacaya, MaraÃ±Ã³n, Pastaza, Ucayali, Huallaga, Purus, Tapiche, Yarapa and Yanayacu rivers, as well as in the lower Puinahua and Iricahua rivers in the Ucayali basin; their occurrence has been mentioned for the Nanay, Orosa, YavarÃ­, Yaguas and Putumayo rivers, and in the Reserva&#160; Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, and in the Yanayacu-Pucate river (Silva 2010); in Colombia in the Putumayo, Amazon and lower CaquetÃ¡ rivers; in Brazil they occur in most major river basins such as SolimÃµes, JapurÃ¡, JuruÃ¡, Purus, Negro and TapajÃ³s.</p>  <p>Although there are no records in the Guyana, the species may occasionally penetrate into southern Guiana close to the boundary with Brazil (Bertram and Bertram 1963). This possibility is enhanced by a Manatee rescue done by INPA in Takutu River border Brazil and Guyana (D. Souza pers. obs).</p>","<p>The historical main use of <em>T. inunguis</em> was to obtain oil, skin and meat (Domning 1982). In remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 Manatees were killed between 1935 and 1954, not counting subsistence hunting (Best 1983, Rosas and Pimentel 2001), which still persists in modern times.</p><p>  </p><p>Currently, the main use of the species is for food. Manatee meat is highly valued, but all the other products are used as well (fat and skin are used in cooking and as medicine, bones are turned into utilitarian pieces and charms, and the skin produces very resistant leather). Medicinal uses are attributed to the fat being rubbed on the affected area (rheumatism and paralysis) and skin (helping the healing process of wounds and infections) (Miranda 2014). A Manatee is held for show to tourists in Puerto Alegria, Peru, upstream from Leticia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Manatees are protected by national laws in all countries of confirmed distribution (Brazil since 1967, Colombia since 1969, Peru since 1973 (Silva 2009) and Ecuador since 2002 (Tirira 2011)). Listed under Appendix I of CITES, signed by the four countries, also signatories of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. All but Colombia are parties to the Convention on Migratory Species.</p><p>Presently there are national management plans specific for the species in Colombia (DirecciÃ³n de Ecosistemas 2005) and Brazil (Andrade <em>et al.</em> 2011) and for aquatic mammals (including Manatees) in Ecuador (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Management plans exist for two protected areas (Pacaya Samiria in Peru and Mamiraua Reserve in Brazil), and Puerto NariÃ±o (Colombia) has informal local management agreement (S. Kendall pers. obs).</p><p>In 2014 the Biodiversity department of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador included Manatee as a focal species for conservation, and relative abundance studies are planned for the Cuyabeno-Yasuni corridor in the Napo river basin between 2016 and 2018. The same department is attempting to have the corridor between the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve and the YasunÃ­ National Park recognized as a RAMSAR site (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2016)</p><p>Amazonian Manatees have been recorded from two protected areas in Ecuador, three in Colombia, four in Peru and at least 53 in Brazil (D. Souza pers. obs). Unfortunately, hunting continues even within protected areas.</p><p>Some 90% of the possible area of distribution of Manatees in Colombia is outside of protected areas. In Colombia the conservation work has been greatly based on participation of local communities (Castelblanco-MartÃ­nez&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). Efforts include year-round conservation and monitoring by the NatÃ¼tama Foundation in the key areas of the Colombian Amazon, with information network for nearby areas; intensive education program<a name=""_GoBack""></a> in the Colombian Amazon, with occasional visits to Tarapaca on the Putumayo river; release of calves by fishermen in the Colombian Amazon (Kendall 2013): 4 releases from nets from 2010-2015 by Natutama and associated fishermen (S. Kendall pers obs).</p><p>Ex-situ research at INPA captive setting (Brazil) and in Amazon Rescue Center (Peru)&#160;is providing the most information about the ecology and biology of the Amazonian Manatee, as reproductive hormone dosages, morphometric, allometric and growth studies of individuals, determination of nutritional parameters of milk in different states of lactation, evaluation of the animal health status, vocalization and acoustic ontogeny, among others.</p><p>Efforts of releasing rehabilitated Manatees back to the wild have been conducted by MamirauÃ¡ Institute (Marmontel 2012, 2015), INPA (Rosas and da Silva 2008, Souza <em>et al. </em>2012), ICMBio (Luna <em>et al. </em>2012) in Brazil, Amazon Rescue Center (Landeo-Yauri and&#160;Castelblanco-MartÃ­nez&#160;2015, SÃ¡nchez-Babilonia 2015) in Peru, and Omacha Foundation in Colombia (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014).

45225428,8010,Erignathus barbatus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large population size, broad distribution, variable feeding habits, and no evidence of a current decline, the Bearded Seal are classified as Least Concern. However, Bearded Seals are very likely going to be negatively impacted by climate change, in particular because of losses of sea ice, and they should be monitored over the coming decades and reassessed as soon as more data become available.","<p>Bearded Seals are the largest northern phocid seal. Burns (1981) found that the average standard length of adults measured from the Bering/Chukchi region was 233 cm, with females slightly longer and substantially heavier than males. Maximum lengths were 233 cm for males and 243 cm for females and maximum weights were 262 kg and 360 kg. Newborn pups averaged 131 cm in length. Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2011) found an average asymptotic length of 219 cm for Bering/Chukchi samples from the 1970s, and 209 cm for samples from the 2000s. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) report a maximum weight of 432 kg for a female collected in the Bering Sea in spring 1985. The Atlantic Bearded Seal is of similar size, and shares the slight sexual dimorphism, with females tending to be larger than males (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Maximum mass recorded in Svalbard is for a female in spring that weighed 424 kg <br/> <br/> In Alaskan waters, sexual maturity is reached between 3 and 6 years in females, with an average of 4 years (Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Males reach sexual maturity at 6-7 years (Burns 1981). In Svalbard, females reach sexual maturity at an age of 5 years, while males are 6 years of age when they are sexually mature though it is likely some years from that point before they compete successfully to breed (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999). Final body size in Bearded Seals is reached at approximately 9-10 years (McLaren 1958). Maximum longevity is likely 25-30 years (Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).</p><p>Bearded Seal pups are normally born on pack ice or small floes of annually-formed sea ice that fracture away from shore-fast ice as it breaks up in late spring (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). They also have been documented to use glacier ice pieces floating on the sea for birthing and nursing when forced to by the lack of availability of first-year sea ice (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The large, precocial pups swim within hours of birth (Kovacs 2009). Peak birthing occurs between late March and mid-May, varying somewhat across the Bearded Sealâs range (Burns 1981, Kovacs 2009). Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2000) estimated that in Svalbard pups are weaned in approximately 24 days. Nursing might be somewhat shorter for the Pacific subspecies, Burns (1981) suggested that pups are weaned at 12-18 days of age. Prior to weaning, their aquatic skills develop to the degree that they spend about half their time in the water, diving for up to 5.5 minutes to depths of up to 84 m (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Mothers spend over 80% of their time in the water while caring for a dependent pup (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999); about half that time is spent away from the neonate, presumably in foraging dives. Females haul-out to nurse their pups on average three times a day. The small amount of time mothers spend out of the water when pups are young is thought to be an adaptive response to Polar Bear predation; when only the pup is on the surface, the pair is less conspicuous to hunting bears (Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Mating takes place at the end of lactation similar to other phocid seals. Males court females and display using elaborate downward trilling vocalizations that can travel many kilometres (Cleator <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989). Individual males use distinct songs, and occupy the same territories over a series of consecutive years within constraints imposed by variable ice conditions, or they show a roaming pattern (Van Parijs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, 2003, 2004). Males exhibit aggression with each other during breeding, including bubble-blowing and physical combat so the mating system is presumably polygynous to some degree.<br/><br/>Bearded seals have an extended moulting period and animals can be found shedding hair from April to August, though there appears to be a peak in May/June for both subspecies (Burns 1981, Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000).&#160; During the moult they spend much of their time hauled out and are reluctant to enter the water (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Bearded seals use sea ice as a haulout platform on a year-round basis whenever it is available, preferring small and medium sized floes and generally avoiding large floes (Simpkins <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). However, they will haul out on land in the summer in the absence of sea ice (e.g., Burns 1981, Merkel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).&#160; They are rarely found more than a body length from access to water even if hauled out on land (Kovacs 2009).<br/><br/>Bearded Seals naturally occur at quite low densities (Bengtson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005); they are typically solitary animals, but they do form small, loose aggregations at times (Burns 1981). <br/><br/>Studies conducted on Atlantic Bearded Seal lactating females and pups (Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000) have shown that diving depths largely reflect local bathymetry in coastal areas.&#160; This reflects their benthic foraging habits; Bearded Seals feed primarily on or near the bottom and most diving is to depths of less than 100 m (though dives of adults have been recorded up to 300 m and young-of-the-year have been recorded diving down to almost 500 m; Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). They use their elaborate whiskers to search for food items on and in soft bottom substrates and have powerful suction abilities to extract prey (Marshall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, 2008). The diet of Bearded Seals varies by age, location, and season (Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1980). Polar Cod (<em>Boreogadis saida</em>), Sculpins, Spider Crab, and Shrimps (<em>Sabinea sptemcarinatus </em>and <em>Sclerocrangon boreas</em>) are the most frequent prey items in Svalbard (Hjelset <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). However, Cod, other demersal fish, and worms are also regular components of the diet in this area. A wide variety of prey has been reported from the Okhotsk Sea, with Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, and Worms accounting for most of their diet (Burns 1981). Quakenbush <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2011) analyzed the frequency of occurrence of prey in 943 Bearded Seal stomachs collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas during 1960-2009 and identified 213 different prey taxa. The most commonly eaten groups were Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, benthic and demersal fishes, and echiuroid worms. These authors found a significant increase in consumption of gadid fishes, principally Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>) and Saffron Cod (<em>Eleginus gracilis</em>), from the 1960s to the 2000s.</p><p>Bearded Seals are preyed upon by Polar Bears, Killer Whales, Greenland Sharks, and Pacific Walruses (Lowry and Fay 1984, Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).</p>","Global climate warming is currently causing major reductions in the extent and duration of sea ice cover in the Arctic, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals. Pinnipeds such as the Bearded Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Laidre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2015; Kovacs 2011, 2012). In 2012, Bearded Seals were listed under the US Endangered Species Act following a detailed review of their status and threats (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) because of the threats posed from climate change induced losses in sea ice and ocean acidification due to climate warming, as well as increasing industrial activities in a more ice-free Arctic (Federal Register 2012). Increasing development and industrialization of the Arctic may threaten Bearded Seals in several ways. Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect them through direct contact with oil and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, that are vulnerable to oil contamination. An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Bearded Seals that are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat they otherwise might use. Increased shipping will pose a greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals. Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2010) concluded that these factors could constitute low to moderate threats to Bearded Seals.<br/><br/>Hunting by indigenous peoples continues throughout most of the species range. There is no evidence of any impact from hunting on Bearded Seal population numbers. For example, reports from Alaska Native subsistence hunters do not give any indication that Bearded Seal numbers have declined (Quakenbush <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).","Population sizes and trends are unknown for all populations of the Atlantic Bearded Seal (see Laidre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015 for a summary). An estimate for Canadian waters of 190,000 animals was suggested by Cleator (1996), based on data collected over a 35-year period, but this number is really an educated guess as opposed to an actual estimate and in any case is now dated. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada more recently assessed the status of this species in Canada as being data deficient (COSEWIC 2007). They are also listed on Greenlandâs Red List as being data deficient (Boertmann 2007). There have never been any surveys for Bearded Seals in Norwegian waters (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006) or Russian territories in the Atlantic Arctic (Reijnders <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1993). However, recordings of their distinctive breeding calls via passive acoustic monitoring networks suggest that this species remains widespread and relatively numerous in the Atlantic Arctic (e.g., Moore <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).<br/><br/>Population data are also incomplete for Pacific Bearded Seals, but this subspecies has received considerably more survey effort. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) concluded that the best estimate for the Okhotsk Sea is 95,000 based on data from 1990 (Fedoseev 2000), and that there are no useful abundance estimates for the East Siberian and Beaufort Seas. Aerial surveys in 1999-2000 estimated about 27,000 Bearded Seals in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea. In the Bering Sea, surveys having been conducted by the USA and the Soviet Union/Russia starting in the 1970s. Early efforts, which covered varying areas and used a variety of methods, suggested an abundance of 50,000-100,000 Bearded Seals in the region. More recently, Ver Hoef <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2014) analyzed line transect survey data collected in the Bering Sea in spring 2007 using a series of models and estimated there were 61,800 Bearded Seals (95% CI 34,900â171,600) in their study area. Because that study included about half of the available sea ice habitat, Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) considered that the total Bearded Seal population in the Bering Sea was about 125,000. It is likely that the total abundance of Pacific Bearded Seals, including the Okhotsk Sea, is at least 250,000.<br/><br/>The global population size of Bearded Seals is unknown. Current population trends are also unknown.",Unknown,"Bearded Seals have a patchy circumpolar distribution throughout much of the Arctic and sub-Arctic, south of 85ÂºN.&#160;In the Pacific sector they range from the Arctic Ocean south through the East Siberian, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas (Burns 1981).&#160;They also occupy all of Hudson Bay and much of the eastern Canadian Archipelago south to southern Labrador, and both coasts of Greenland. They occur along the north shore of Iceland, within the Svalbard Archipelago, in the drifting pack ice of the Barents Sea and across much of the north coast of the Russian Federation (Kovacs 2009). Bearded Seal vagrants have been reported from many locations outside the Arctic including Portugal (van Bree 2000), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, northern Newfoundland, and Massachusetts&#160;(Gosselin and Boily 1994)&#160;in the North Atlantic, as well as in Japan and China in the North Pacific (Rice 1998).<br/> <br/> Bearded Seals are strongly associated with sea ice and are benthic feeders, and these two attributes explain much of their seasonal movement patterns and their general distribution. While they are not strictly migratory, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi region undergo seasonal movements linked with the advance and retreat of sea ice (Burns 1981, Cameron <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, in some other regions they are quite sedentary throughout the year, such as in Svalbard, Norway (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).","<p></p><p>Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have hunted Bearded Seals for subsistence for thousands of years, a practice that continues today throughout much of the speciesâ range. However, levels of subsistence harvest are not well known. Subsistence harvests of Bearded Seals in Alaska were estimated to average approximately 6,800/year during 1990-1998 (Allen and Angliss 2010). Some animals are struck and lost, especially from late spring to mid summer when they are thinnest, and if those animals are accounted for the annual Alaska harvest could be as high as 10,000. An additional 1,000-2,000 may be taken by coastal hunters in Chukotka (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Subsistence harvest levels are not closely monitored in Canada, but Cleator (1996) estimated that roughly 2,400 Bearded Seals were taken per year. In Greenland Bearded Seals make up only 1-2% of the Seal catch (Garde 2013), with some few hundred taken annually. Bearded Seals are hunted at low levels in Svalbard currently, but during the whaling period individual boats would take hundreds. They are also harvested in the White Sea.<br/> <br/> The former Soviet Union historically conducted ship-based commercial harvests of Bearded Seals in the North Pacific region, in the Bering, Chukchi, and Okhotsk Seas. Harvests grew from 9,000 to 13,000 for the Bering and Okhotsk seas combined during 1957-1964, and were 8,000 to 10,000 per year during 1964-1967 (Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992). Ship-based harvests were suspended from 1970 to 1975, and took place at lower levels when they resumed (Kelly 1988). There is currently no significant commercial harvest of Bearded Seals in Russia.</p>",Terrestrial|Marine,"Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act generally prohibits taking of Bearded Seals unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. In 2012, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi and Okhotsk Seas were listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (Federal Register 2012). In Canada, subsistence hunting of Bearded Seals is co-managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and regional resource boards (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Licensed hunters can shoot Bearded Seals in Svalbard, outside protected areas and during open seasons, that are set in periods when Bearded Seals shot in the water are least likely to sink (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). In Russia, the âLaw of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resourcesâ provides for subsistence harvest of Seals by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a total allowable catch is determined annually. Russia is the only nation to set a quota on the number of Bearded Seals that can be harvested, it is an âopenâ hunt in all other regions.<br/><br/>Bearded Seals are able to use glacier ice pieces that have calved into the sea as haul-out platforms, so tidal glacier fronts are increasingly important to them in areas where sea ice declines are marked (Lydersen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Tidal glacier fjords may represent important breeding refugias in the future as sea ice continues to decline and this habitat type should be considered for special conservation status.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Average body length reaches 126-129 cm, with a maximum body length of approximately 140 cm (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Both sexes become sexually mature at about 6 years of age, with most breeding females (74% in a 1974 sample) aged between 8 and 17 years (Popov 1979, 1982). The pregnancy rate for females older than 9 is reported to be as low as 0.2-0.33 (Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Miyazaki 2002), and Krylov (1990) reports a similar low rate of 0.34 for females aged 10-14 years. HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), acknowledge that the reproductive rate is low in females &gt;20 years old, but suggest that the reproductive rate is &gt;0.5 for females &lt;20 years old taken together as a group. Since females &lt;20 years old make up approximately two-thirds of the population of adult females, they probably drive the overall reproductive rate for the population up to about 0.5. Both Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1999) and HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) attribute the lower reproductive rates of older females to the effect of long term exposure to organochlorine contaminants in the older animals. Accumulation of contaminants with age has been documented in Caspian seals, but most animals appear to be below thresholds associated with reproductive pathologies (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Pups are generally born from mid-January to late February on the ice, with a birth weight of around 5 kg (Popov 1979), and are nursed for 4-5 weeks. In contrast to ringed seals, females do not usually construct lairs (Frost and Lowry 1981), possibly because sufficient amounts of snow overlying the ice are normally lacking. Pupping on the ice without lairs has allowed direct counts of pups to be made in the recent aerial surveys (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pups do not enter the water until the ice melts in mid to late March.<br/><br/>The first documented observations of small numbers of Seals breeding in other parts of the Caspian were made in 1982, with females reported pupping on small sand islands in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, although it is likely this behaviour was not new (Krylov 1990). Large numbers of mostly nonbreeding Seals spend the winter in the middle and southern Caspian, with one estimate of 15,000 Seals along the Turkmenistan coast (Krylov 1990).<br/><br/>A post-breeding moult occurs from April to early May, during which the Seals first use the ice and then islands, sand bars, and reed beds for hauling out (Badamshin 1970, Krylov 1990). Presently, Komsomolets Bay and the Durnev Islands in Kazakhstan and Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj island in Russian waters represent the most important moulting habitats (Dmitrieva 2013). Aggregations of several tens of thousands of individuals can be found in Komsomoletz Bay during this period, and around ten thousand at Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj.<br/><br/>During late spring, summer, and early autumn, Caspian Seals are distributed throughout the Caspian Sea. They feed throughout the region, exploiting both the shallow basin in the north and the deep middle and southern basins (Krylov 1990). Recent satellite telemetry studies indicate about 60% of animals move to the middle and southern Caspian, with the remainder staying in the north, primarily around the inflow of Volga and Ural rivers (Dmitrieva 2013). The telemetry studies suggest considerable individual variation in summer migratory and foraging behavior, with individuals spending the summer period separated among shallow, intermediate, and deep water locations. This may reflect individual specialization or niche partitioning in relation to habitat or prey types (Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015a). <br/><br/>During the post-moult summer period Seals rarely haul out, spending several months at sea feeding. In late autumn the breeding adults gather in the northeast, hauling out on sandy islands and reed beds in increasing numbers until ice begins to form (Krylov 1990). When the surface freezes over, females form aggregations on the ice to give birth to their pups, tending to gather along cracks in the ice giving them ready access to the water, although like Ringed Seals they also construct and maintain holes in the ice for water access (Heptner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Diving capacity for Caspian Seals is comparable to other small phocids, with maximum dive depths exceeding 200 m and dive times exceeding 20 minutes, but most dives are typically shallower than 15 m and shorter than 5 minutes. During the summer foraging areas are not limited by proximity to haul out sites, and animals may spend up to six months at sea. Foraging appears to be primarily benthic (Dmitrieva 2013).<br/><br/>Caspian Seals feed on a variety of fish species. During the summer and autumn, Seals move to and congregate where prey are abundant, particularly Caspian Kilka (<em>Clupeonella </em>sp.), Caspian Silverside (<em>Atherina mochon</em>), and Caspian Gobies (<em>Gobidae</em>) (Krylov 1990), with <em>Clupeonella </em>species historically making up a major proportion of their total annual diet (Kosarev and Yablonskaya 1994). A report on fish found in the stomachs of Seals in the northern Caspian in 1986-1987 (Piletskii and Krylov 1990) suggested that fish eaten in order of frequency were Roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>), Zander (<em>Lucioperca lucioperca</em>), Gobies (<em>Knipowitschia </em>sp., <em>Neogobius kessleri</em> and <em>Benthophilus </em>sp.), and Bream (<em>Blicca bjoerkna </em>and <em>Abramis brama</em>), followed by C. deliculata and other species. A preliminary study from faecal samples collected on the Apsheron Peninsula in June 2001 and March 2002 suggested that Gobies, Silverside, and shrimp were important constituents of the diet of Seals at those times (Eybatov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). New studies of diet in Caspian Seals are required in order to get an accurate picture of current prey in different areas of the Caspian in light of potential changes to the abundance of fish species due to recent ecological changes occurring in the region.","Unsustainable hunting was the main driver of Caspian Seal decline during the 20th century (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em>et al.</em> 2012), and human caused mortality continues to be the main ongoing threat to the population. Recently, by-catch of Seals, primarily in illegal Sturgeon fisheries has been identified as a major cause of Seal mortality (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on semi-structured interviews conducted in fishing communities from Dagestan (Russia), Astrakhan region (Russia), and Atyrau region (Kazakhstan), Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2013) documented a minimum by-catch of 1,215 Seals during the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93% of which occurred in illegal Sturgeon fisheries. However, the study sampling reflected less than 10% of the overall poaching activity in the north Caspian, so the actual by-catch is likely to be substantially higher, and to exceed the Potential Biological Removal level (Wade <em>et al.</em> 1998) for the population (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Moreover, the survey did not cover fisheries in the middle and southern Caspian. Iranian commercial fisheries cause an estimated mortality of 500 Seals annually (Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). Further work is needed to fully quantify Seal by-catch rates throughout the Caspian Sea, and its implications for population demography. Fishermen frequently sell skins and blubber from bycaught Seals.<br/><br/>Natural sources of mortality include predation and disease. The primary non-human predators are Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Sea Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus </em>spp.). Krylov (1990) estimated that Wolves killed 17-40% of Caspian Seal pups on âsome breeding grounds from 1974 to 1976â, while Eagles took less than 1% of pups. The reverse was found during recent aerial surveys (Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). Few Wolves were observed each year between 2005-2012, but up to 3,100 Eagles. Eagles are likely to primarily scavenge afterbirth and dead pups, but may also be capable of killing unaccompanied unweaned pups.<br/><br/>Mass mortality events occurred in 1997 and 2000-2001, killing several thousand Seals each time, and have since been attributed to canine distemper virus (CDV). Presence of a hitherto unknown strain of CDV was confirmed in one dead Seal in 1997 (Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 1998), and the same strain was confirmed as the primary cause of death in Seals dying in 2000 in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Examination of archived stranding records in Azerbaijan since 1971, show an increased mortality every few years, suggesting the possibility of previous outbreaks of CDV (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). A serology study of archived samples indicated that CDV was present in Caspian Seals in 1993, 1997, and 1998 (Ohashi <em>et al.</em> 2001). There have been no further mass mortalities since 2001, but disease would become a concern should they reoccur.<br/><br/>Degradation of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and overexploitation of primary food resources may also be threats to Caspian Seals (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Barannik <em>et al.</em> 2004). An invasive of Comb Jellyfish, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, arrived in the Caspian Sea via ship ballast water in the Volga-Don Canal in 1999 (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000). Comb Jellyfish consume zooplankton rapidly, leading indirectly to a reduction in fish stocks and a substantial impact on local fisheries. A 70% reduction in commercial landings of three species of Kilka was recorded within three years of the Comb Jellyfish invasion (Kideys <em>et al.</em> 2005). Kilka are thought to be important prey for Caspian Seals in the central and southern parts of the sea, and the invasion of Comb Jellyfish is considered a threat to the Seals (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). In addition to impacts from Comb Jellyfish, most commercial fisheries in the Caspian are considered to be severely depleted or extinct due to unsustainable fishing practices and/or loss of fish habitats such as spawning grounds (Strukova and Guchgeldiyev 2010). While Caspian Seals are known to feed to on commercially important fish species, commercial catch rates are not necessarily an indicator of prey availability, and Seals have a varied and adaptable diet which includes non-commercial species such as Gobies. To date is has not been possible to make any quantitative assessment on potential impacts from changes in Caspian food webs and Caspian Seal energetics and demography. Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2015) did not find a significant correlation when testing for association between annual pup production and net primary productivity 2005-2012, but a longer time series of surveys is required to achieve adequate statistical power.<br/><br/>The Caspian Sea has no outlet and receives most of its input from the Volga, Ural, and other rivers. Contamination of the Volga with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, but levels in Seals do not appear to be elevated, with the exception of zinc in some diseased animals that may have suffered homeostatic disturbance of trace metal levels (Anan <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Organochlorine levels (principally polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs)) have been assessed for Caspian Seals dying in the 1997-2001 CDV epizootics (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1999; Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2008; Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most animals were found to have levels below thresholds believed to cause toxic effects in mammals. Overall levels in Caspian Seals were lower than those seen in European Seal species, comparable to Baikal Seals, and higher than those reported for Arctic species (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Presently there is no evidence that organochlorine burdens in Caspian Seals cause reproductive or immune impairment, or contributed to the 1997-2001 CDV outbreaks at a population level, although some individual Seals may have high burdens (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002,&#160;HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Organochlorine accumulation was found to be primarily age related, which means animals at the older end of the age distribution may be at risk of crossing toxicity thresholds towards the end of their reproductive lifespan (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has been recommended that levels of persistent organic pollutants should be monitored in the future due to the continuing industrial development around the Caspian region and time elapsed since the last survey following the CDV epizootics (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Combined juvenile mortality from continued hunting, natural predation, and fisheries by-catch is believed to be unsustainable. Overall mortality before breeding from all sources is likely to be in the region of 50% (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Demographic models indicate such a high rate of juvenile mortality would be capable of causing a continuing decline in the Caspian Seal population, with lowered fertility due to organochlorine contamination being a relatively minor factor (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Variation in annual pup production determined from aerial surveys makes empirical estimation of current population trends uncertain (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b), and a longer time series is necessary to assess the demographic trajectory directly.<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species with no option to migrate to alternative habitats, Caspian Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). Warming may cause a reduction in the spatial extent, temporal duration, and stability of the winter ice breeding habitat. Premature break-up of the ice sheet before pups are moulted will cause significant mortality among pups of the year. January-March 2007 was one of the mildest winters in the Caspian in recent years, with ice cover suitable for breeding limited to a narrow strip along the coastline of the north-east Caspian. Storms in mid-February may have caused ice-flows with large numbers of pups to be swept out to sea, and pup counts for that year were less than one third the maximum observed for 2005-2012 (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). It has also been suggested that poor ice conditions may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV outbreaks due to Seal crowding on limited haulout space and poor condition of weaned pups (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Long term trends in Caspian Sea ice cover and the implications for population demography remain to be fully assessed.<br/><br/>Through the geological history of the Caspian, there have been several substantial fluctuations of sea level (Dumont 1998), which will have affected the relative amounts of shallow and deep water habitats available to Seals. The population adapted to those past changes, but there is some concern about whether the same will be possible for future sea level changes given added pressures of habitat loss and human impacts.<br/><br/>Further threats to the Seals on shore and on ice now come from increasing disturbance due to offshore and shoreline developments. One of the largest oil fields in the world is currently being developed in the Caspian, with the construction of numerous offshore oil drilling islands, pipelines, shipping access to these, and onshore logistics facilities. A recent study found that breeding Seals are using shipping channels as artificial leads into the ice and are giving birth close to the edge of these channels. A significant proportion of the breeding population and pups may therefore experience disturbance by shipping traffic depending on the ice conditions (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em>et al.</em> 2008). More research is required to quantify the likely impacts of this intensive oil development. The coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran have also seen increased development for domestic and leisure use in recent years, with many previously undisturbed stretches of coast now being developed.<br/><br/>Disturbance of island and reef haulout sites by illegal fishing activities and opportunistic Seal hunting are another ongoing problem. Recent surveys have found that the Caspian Seal has effectively disappeared from Azerbaijan, with the once important haulout sites of the Apsheron Peninsula and Archipelago abandoned. These sites were used by many thousands of Seals until the 1930s when they were heavily hunted (Krylov 1990). However, between 1997 and 2002 a few hundred Seals were still counted regularly at these sites (e.g., Allchin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Few live Seals have been seen in this area since 2004 (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). The overall Caspian Seal population decline since 2002 is unlikely to account for this total disappearance, which is most probably due in part to severe disturbance by illegal fishing and other coastal activities (T. Eybatov, unpublished data). Similar declines in the regularity of Seal occupancy have also been noted recently at other sites, such as South West Island near the Ural Delta and Osushnoy Island (Kazakhstan), Bautino (Kazakhstan), and in Turkmenbashi Bay (Turkmenistan). The number of Seals at Ogurchinsky Island (Turkmenistan) has also declined from several thousand in the 1980s to a few hundred (P. Erokhin, unpublished observations). The only previously recorded haulout site in Iran, at Ashoora Island, is no longer used by Seals (H. Asadi pers. comm.). There is a need to develop an inventory of all haulout sites throughout the Caspian together with archived and current records of Seal occupancy (Wilson and Goodman 2012).","Historically, the population of Caspian Seals was estimated to have exceeded one million (Krylov 1990, HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). The most recent estimates of abundance are based on aerial surveys of the breeding population on the northern ice field conducted annually in February between 2005 and 2012 (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). During this period estimated annual pup production ranged between 8,200 (95% confidence intervals 7,130-9,342) and 34,000 (95% confidence intervals 31,275-36,814). This would suggest there are currently approximately 68,000 reproductively mature individuals (male and female, based on the greatest observed pup production), with the total population in the region of 104,000 to 168,000 individuals derived from an age structured model (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2012; Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). Variation in weather conditions during surveys may account for some of difference in pup counts between years, but additional contributions from biological factors affecting fecundity cannot be excluded at this time (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). The variability in annual pup makes the current population trend uncertain, and a longer time series is necessary to directly assess the demographic trajectory (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). However, if pup mortality exceeds 50% due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes (a realistic scenario), this could be sufficient to result in ongoing declines (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>The population decline throughout the 20th century has been reconstructed by a demographic model using hunting statistics. By the 1950sâ1960s, the population was estimated from this model to have been reduced to between 400,000-500,000 Seals (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), while an estimate based on a harvest of 86,000 pups in 1966, believed to be most pups born that year, also produced an estimate of 500,000 Seals for that year (Krylov 1990). Aerial surveys conducted in 1976 and 1980 suggested an estimate of 450,000 animals (Krylov 1990), although the hind-casting analysis suggests a population of only about 200,000 Seals remaining at that time (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Surveys in 1987 and 1989 resulted in an estimate of approximately 360,000-400,000 (Krylov 1990), but again the hind-casting analysis suggests this might again have been an over-estimate, with perhaps only about 130,000 Seals remaining by the late 1980s. Overall, the hind-casting analysis indicated a population reduction of about 66% during 1867-1964 and a further reduction of 73% during 1965-2005 (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) estimated the total population of adult females as 354,210 in 1945 and 21,000 in 2005, later revised to 34,000 by Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015b) after accounting for survey observation errors. Although pup production has been revised upwards in more recent publications, this would not affect the relative decline, since it would imply correspondingly higher historical population sizes. The IUCN Criterion A calculator was used to project declines over a three generation period 1955-2015, indicating adult female numbers declined 91.5%. However, the scale of decline is dependent on estimated values for parameters such as pup survival and fertility rates, about which there is some uncertainty (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Therefore a more conservative position for the purposes of IUCN classification would be to accept a relative decline of at least 70% until more data are available to refine the historical demography.<br/><br/>Generation time from Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) is 18.8 years.",Unknown,"Caspian Seals are confined to the Caspian Sea. They range throughout the sea with seasonal migration between the southern, middle, and northern basins. More than 99.9% of breeding takes place on ice, which covers the shallow northern parts of the Caspian Sea in from late December to early April in typical years (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013, Dmitrieva <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015a). Occasional observations have been made of low numbers (a few tens of individuals) breeding on islets off Turkmenistan (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013).","Caspian Seals have been commercially exploited since the late 18th century. Harvests averaged 119,000-174,000 per year throughout the 19th century, with peaks of 300,000 having been recorded. In the 20th century, harvest levels peaked in the 1930s with an average annual harvest of 164,000 and a maximum single year take of 227,600. The numbers of Seals taken fell during World War II to an average of 60,800 per year, and subsequently ranged between a low of 41,400 and a high of 108,300 for the period 1951-1975 (Krylov 1990, HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Commercial harvesting was temporarily halted in 1996 after a much-reduced estimated take of 14,000 Seals. Since the start of the 21st century smaller scale commercial and scientific hunting has taken place in Russia, typically with recorded hunts of tens or hundreds of individuals per year, with a maximum of 4,600 (in 2003-2004), reported for the period up to 2010. Official hunting is conducted under a quota system administered by an inter-governmental body, the Caspian Bioresources Commission. Typical annual quotas are for 18,000 Seals, with 8,000 allocated to Russia, and the remainder divided among the other Caspian states. The scientific rationale for the quotas is not clear. Currently only Russia actively pursues official hunting under the quota, but large scale hunting does not appear to be commercially viable at present and recorded takes are far below the official quota levels (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). The level of âunofficialâ or illegal hunting is poorly documented, but illegal hunting on ice on the scale of hundreds of Seals is known to take place periodically (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Seal skins are used for hats and other clothing in Russia, while Seal blubber is used as a medicinal tonic, fishing bait, and cattle feed in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The total economic value and trading networks for Seal products remain to be fully determined, but high quality individual seal skins may sell for up to $100 US dollars at the point of origin, while seal oil can sell for $14.00 per litre in local markets (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Various prohibitions, quotas, and protective measures have been taken to conserve the Caspian Seal, beginning in 1940 when seal nets were prohibited. The harvest of moulting Seals in the spring was ended in 1946, and in 1952 the Apsheron Archipelago in Azerbaijan was closed to sealing. Female harvesting on the breeding grounds was stopped in 1966 and all take was prohibited on the eastern islands of the northern Caspian in 1967. These last two changes led to a complete change in the commercial harvest, resulting in a switch to newborn and moulted pups. Quotas on harvest of pups, purportedly based on biological data, began in 1970 (Krylov 1990), although in retrospect the quotas were at unsustainable levels. The Russian Federation continues to consider the Caspian Seal to be a âharvestedâ species, with quotas set through the Caspian Bioresources Commission (HÃ¤rkÃ¶nen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2012).<br/><br/>A Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan was approved by the nations bordering the Caspian Sea, pursuant to the 2003 Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Caspian Environment Programme 2007), but it had no legally binding actions. The action plan recommended cessation of hunting, measures to reduce by-catch in legal and illegal fisheries, and the strategic creation of protected areas of sea, ice, and shore. However, to date none of the Caspian states have taken steps to implement the action plan. In 2012 the CaspEco Project, a UNDP funded follow up to the Caspian Environment Programme, published a framework report and road map for the establishment of a network of protected areas for Caspian Seals, including suitable locations (Wilson and Goodman 2012), but no further action has yet taken place. A number of small non-governmental organizations within Caspian countries are involved in producing educational materials and promoting awareness of Caspian Seals. In Iran, localised work with fishing communities has been conducted promoting release rather than killing of live animals found entangled in fishing gear, and a stranded seal rehabilitation facility has been established. In 2014 the Caspian States banned all catching of wild Sturgeon and in recent years Kazakhstan has increased maritime patrols to counter Sturgeon poaching which in principle may have potential to also help reduce seal by-catch.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species is most abundant in the southern North Sea. It occurs over sandy substrates to depths of 200 m, while juveniles can be found in shallower waters.&#160;<em>Limanda limanda</em>&#160;is taken as bycatch in a number of fisheries, particularly demersal trawl fisheries, and may also be impacted by eutrophication and pollution events occurring within its range.&#160;This is an abundant species which appears to be increasing in abundance in parts of its range, particularly in the southern North Sea where it appears to be most abundant. <em>Limanda limanda</em> is the subject of regulatory measures, including total allowable catches (TACs). It is also found in marine protected areas throughout its range.<em> Limanda limanda</em> is assessed as Least Concern (LC).","<strong>Habitat and Ecology</strong><br/>Juvenile<em> Limanda limanda</em>&#160;uses shallow, sandy sediments in coastal waters as nursery grounds. Older, larger individuals of&#160;<em>Limanda limanda</em> occur in neritic waters on sandy substrata. This species is generalized benthivore which feeds on a wide variety of prey including brittle stars, crustaceans, polychaetes, other echinoderms (sea urchins), bivalves and small fishes. Females of this species tend to consume a significantly greater amount of food than males (LozÃ¡n 1992).&#160;This species is sensitive to sounds with frequencies from 30 Hz to 250 Hz with the greatest sensitivity from 110 Hz to 160 Hz (Chapman and Sand 1974).<br/><br/><strong>Life History and Reproduction</strong><br/>The spawning grounds of this species are offshore from 30 m to 50 m depth. The spawning season is from January to September with shorter seasons for each spawning ground. Older, larger individuals commence reproduction first. This species batch spawns with the ovaries maturing at two different rates (Hendersen 1998).  Along the west coast of the British Isles, peak spawning takes place&#160;from  February to April, as late as July in the Barents Sea, and in the North  Sea spawning starts in the south in late January/February and progresses  northwards and inwards towards deeper water where peak spawning occurs  from May to June&#160;(Hendersen 1998).&#160;Larvae become benthic between 13 mm and 20 mm length (Russell 1976) and settle out at depths of two to five metres (Bolle <em>et al.</em> 1994).&#160;Growth rates vary between populations (Jonsson 1966, Lee 1972, Ortega Salas 1988). Maximum size for this species is 40 cm standard length (SL) (Nielsen 1986). In the North Sea, the species matures at lengths from 10 cm to 14 cm (Lee 1972, Htun  1978). In the North Sea, the age of first reproduction is two years for males  and two to three years for females (Bohl 1957).&#160;Life expectancy in the Irish Sea is eight to nine years and 11 years in  the North Sea (Ortega Salas 1981, Lee 1972).","<em>Limanda limanda</em> is a component of the bycatch of demersal trawl fisheries in nearshore and offshore waters.&#160;It is exposed to polyaromatic contaminants (Piechotta <em>et al</em>&#160;1999, Sleiderink <em>et al.</em> 2005) in nearshore waters.&#160;Although <em>L. limanda</em>&#160;has demonstrated the ability to adapt to low oxygen levels, lethally low levels of oxygen induces stress which in turn can result in the outbreak of disease such as lymphocystis and epidermal papilloma (Weber 1993, Mellergaard and Nielsen 1995).&#160;<br/><br/>In the past,<em> L. limanda </em>experienced both inhibitory and stimulatory immune responses when exposed to diesel-based drilling mud which was common around drilling platforms in the North Sea (Tahir <em>et al.</em> 1993).&#160;Since this species is sensitive to sounds with frequencies from 30 Hz to 250   Hz with the greatest sensitivity from 110 Hz to 160 Hz (Chapman and Sand   1974), it may be impacted in areas with high sound production.","<em>Limanda limanda</em> is a common and abundant species which is captured as bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries.

Juveniles occur in shallower areas from less than one metre.","<em>Limanda limanda</em>&#160;is captured as bycatch, primarily in the beam trawl but also in the shrimp, flatfish and demersal species fisheries. Catches of this species may be discarded depending on the availability of the target species and the market price. Landings of&#160;<em>L. limanda</em>&#160;have decreased since the year 2000 (ICES 2013).&#160;In the inner Danish waters, this species is included among a mix of flatfish species taken in a variety of inshore fisheries. In other areas it is a bycatch species in demersal trawl fisheries.&#160;Global landings of <em>L. limanda</em>&#160;peaked in 1998 at 22,134 t and declined to 10,698 t by 2008.&#160;Information on total catch is not available, but discards are considered to be substantial (ICES 2013).&#160;The total landings for <em>L. limanda</em>&#160;in the North Sea in 2012 were 6,673 t, 50% of which were landed by beam trawl and 45% from otter trawl.&#160;Landings for 2012 were 1,300 t primarily by the demersal trawl fishery.&#160;Total catches for 2012 are unknown as discards are high but not quantifiable (ICES 2013).<br/><u><br/></u>",Marine,"<em>Limanda limanda</em> is subject to several regulatory measures within the ICES area.

50347659,2467,Balaena mysticetus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The global (pan-arctic) population of the Bowhead Whale appears to be increasing, due primarily to the well-documented increase in the large Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort Seas subpopulation (also known as the Western Arctic population or stock). The global population size, at over 25,000 animals, is well above the IUCN Red List Vulnerable threshold for a non-declining population. The Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort subpopulation (estimated to be over 16,000 and increasing at 3% per year or more) may have recovered to near or even above its level prior to commercial whaling. The East Canada â West Greenland subpopulation is estimated to exceed 4,000, and has probably been increasing but is still below its pre-whaling level. Bowhead Whale numbers in the East Greenland â Svalbard â Barents Sea subpopulation remain at a small fraction of pre-whaling abundance with no estimate of trend. The main reduction in the global population occurred before the three-generation time window that would trigger the Red List population reduction (A) criterion. The East Greenland â Svalbard â Barents Sea and Okhotsk Sea  subpopulations have separate Red List assessments, in addition to being included in this global assessment.</p>  <p>  </p>","Small to medium-sized crustaceans, especially krill and copepods, form the bulk of the Bowhead Whale diet (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pomerleau <em>et al</em>. 2011). Bowheads also commonly feed on mysids and gammarid amphipods, and the diet includes at least 60 species (Lowry 1993).<br/><br/>The seasonal distribution of Bowhead Whales is strongly influenced by prey availability and pack ice conditions (Moore and Reeves 1993). During the winter, they occur within areas of sea ice (Stafford <em>et al.</em> 2012) and appear to feed mainly near the bottom (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). During the spring, they use leads and cracks in the ice to penetrate areas that were inaccessible during the winter due to heavy ice coverage. During the summer and autumn, they concentrate in areas where zooplankton production is high or where large-scale biophysical processes create local concentrations of calanoid copepods (Finley 1990, Finley <em>et al</em>. 2000) and appear to feed mainly in mid-water and near the surface (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Pacific Arctic, six feeding hotspots have been identified including two in the Bering Sea and one in the Chukchi Sea along the northern coast of Chukotka where there is evidence of winter feeding, and three in the Beaufort Sea where most of the feeding occurs in summer and autumn (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The Bowhead Whale may be the longest-living mammal, possibly capable of living for over 200 years (George <em>et al.</em> 1999, Keane <em>et al. </em>2015, Wetzel <em>et al.</em> 2017). Nearly all life history data come from the Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort Seas population. Female age at sexual maturity is estimated at 18-33 years (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2013). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated the mean generation time for Bowhead Whales to be about 52 years, assuming an age at first reproduction of 20 years. Females give birth every 3-7 years (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 1992) and calves are weaned at 9-12 months of age (Koski <em>et al. </em>1993).<p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Extensive commercial hunting, beginning in the 1500s, depleted Bowhead Whales throughout their range. Commercial whaling for the species has been prohibited under international conventions since the 1930s. The limited subsistence whaling by indigenous communities  mentioned above has not impeded the recovery of the affected populations.</p><p>Accidental human-caused deaths are relatively few. During 2010-15, two dead-stranded and one live Bowhead were observed to be entangled with fishing gear but it was unclear whether the entanglement was the cause of death. Of the Bowhead Whales taken in Alaskan hunts during 1990-2012, 12% showed scars or wounds from fishing gear and 2% showed scars or wounds from ship strikes (George <em>et al.</em> 2017a).</p>  <p>There has been concern since the 1970s that disturbance from oil and gas exploration and extraction activities in the Arctic region would affect Bowhead Whales. Effects on diving behavior (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and calling rates (Blackwell <em>et al.</em> 2015) in the vicinity of seismic surveys have been observed, but to date there has been no discernible population-level impact. Examination of whales taken in subsistence hunts off Alaska since 1980 found relatively low levels of morbidity, which would be consistent with an increasing population and good individual animal health (George <em>et al</em>. 2017b).</p>  <p>During this century, a profound reduction in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic has occurred and this reduction is predicted to continue, possibly leading eventually to the complete disappearance of sea ice in summer as mean Arctic temperatures rise faster than the global average (Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The short-term effects of reduced ice cover on Bowhead Whales in the western Arctic appear to be positive, due to increased feeding opportunities (George <em>et al</em>. 2015, Moore 2016). However, the long-term effects are less clear. The emergence of Bowheads as a separate, ice-adapted species may have coincided with the appearance of sea ice in the late Pliocene, and Bowheads could lose out to non-ice-adapted species in the long term, but no projections of the time scale of such an eventuality are available (Harington 2008, IWC 2016).&#160; </p>  <p>There is also concern that, as the sea ice diminishes, the opening up of the Arctic to increased vessel traffic, fishing activities, and extractive industries will increase human-caused impacts on Bowhead Whales (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014).&#160; </p>","<em><strong>Current Population sizes</strong></em><br/>The Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort Seas subpopulation is estimated to have numbered 16,900 (15,700-18,900) in 2011 from shore/ice-based counts (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2016) or&#160;19,000 (12,400-28,500) from photo-identification capture-recapture (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160; Numbers in the East Canada â West Greenland subpopulation are estimated at 4,000-10,500 in 2013 from aerial surveys (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al.</em> 2015) or 4,500-11,000 in 2008-12 from genetic mark-recapture (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Given the increasing trend in the large Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort subpopulation, the total range-wide population likely exceeds 25,000 individuals. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation is estimated to be only about 200, and the East Greenland â Svalbard â Barents Sea subpopulation probably also numbers in the hundreds (see separate listings).<strong><em><br/> <br/> <strong>Population trends<br/></strong></em></strong>The Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort Seas subpopulation has been monitored for more than 30 years and has been increasing over that period at an estimated annual rate of 3.7% (range 2.8â5.4%) in the presence of subsistence hunting (Givens <em>et al. </em>2016). The East Canada â West Greenland subpopulation has probably also been increasing. Based on aerial surveys and genetic capture-recapture, Rekdal <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that the number of Bowhead Whales using West Greenland waters in the winter-spring period increased from 1998 to 2006 and has levelled off since then. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation may be declining (Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2017). No estimates of trend are available for the East Greenland â Svalbard â Barents Sea subpopulation.<strong><em><br/><br/>Pre-whaling population sizes</em></strong><em></em><br/>Commercial whaling for Bowhead Whales in the Bering Sea began in 1848 and expanded rapidly, depleting the worldwide population (Bockstoce and Burns 1993). Brandon and Wade (2006) estimated the initial abundance of the Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort subpopulation at 10â20,000. Using a different kind of population model, Witting (2013) estimated pre-whaling abundance to be 13-24,000. Therefore, the Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort subpopulation appears to have reached or exceeded estimates of its size prior to commercial whaling. All models indicate that the population reached a minimum size around 1914.<br/><br/>Basque whalers took Bowhead Whales in the northwestern Atlantic in the 16th century, but ambiguities over the species identity of whales taken in early commercial whaling have made interpretation of old catch records difficult. Genetic analysis of bones from 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century shore stations in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St Lawrence found that, contrary to previous assumptions, almost all bones were from Bowhead Whales rather than North Atlantic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena glacialis</em>) (Macleod <em>et al.</em> 2008). This suggests that 25-40,000 Bowhead Whales were taken in the eastern Canadian Arctic by Basque whalers during 1530-1610, followed by approximately 28,000 during the pelagic whaling phase during 1719-1915 (Ross, 1993).<br/><br/>The pre-whaling size of the East Canada â West Greenland population was thus probably at least 25,000, well above the likely current level.The pre-whaling size of the East Greenland â Svalbard â Barents Sea population has been estimated to be 33,000-65,000 using a simple population model (Allen and Keay 2006) applied to historical catch data from Dutch, German, and British sources compiled by de Jong (1983). The current population size, therefore, is a small fraction of the pre-whaling size.  The pre-whaling population size in the Okhtosk Sea has been variously estimated as between 3,000 and 20,000 depending on assumptions about past catches (Ivashchenko and Clapham 2010). The current population size is a small fraction of those estimates.",Increasing,"<p>Bowhead Whales are found only in Arctic and subarctic regions. Until recently they have spent much of their lives in and near sea ice and they migrate seasonally to avoid ice entrapment and to take advantage of food concentrations (Moore and Reeves 1993). With the reduction of sea ice cover, Bowhead Whales now occur increasingly in open water during the summer (Moore 2016).<br/> <br/> The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has traditionally recognized five stocks named for the regions in which Bowheads occur: Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort Seas; Hudson Bay â Foxe Basin; Davis Strait â Baffin Bay; Svalbard â Barents Sea (Spitsbergen); and Okhotsk Sea (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 2003). Movements of tagged Bowheads indicating somewhat overlapping ranges, and lack of clear genetic differences, has discredited the traditional distinction between the Hudson Bay â Foxe Basin and the Davis Strait â Baffin Bay populations (Heide-JÃ¸rgensen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Postma <em>et al.</em> 2006, Alter <em>et al.</em> 2012, IWC 2012). Four main subpopulations are now recognized: Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort Seas; East Canada â West Greenland; East Greenland â Svalbard â Barents Sea; and Okhotsk Sea. The boundary between the Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort Seas and Eastern Canada â West Greenland subpopulations is liable to become more porous as sea ice cover diminishes (Heide-JÃ¸rgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>With the exception of the Okhotsk Sea, genetic divergence between Bowhead Whales in different parts of their range appears to be low, and there is some evidence of movement between the main areas of occurrence (IWC 2013). The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation appears to be genetically and geographically isolated.</p>  <p>Based on direct observations and telemetry, the summer range of the Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort Seas subpopulation extends from Chaunskaya Guba (Russian Federation) in the western Chukchi Sea through the Beaufort Sea and east to Amundsen Gulf (Canada) and Viscount Melville Sound (Heide-JÃ¸rgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Most of the whales appear to migrate into the Bering Sea in winter (IWC 2013, Quakenbush <em>et al.</em> 2012, Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, substantial catches were also taken in summer in the Bering Sea,&#160;but the climatic conditions were quite different then than at the present (IWC 2013) </p>  <p>Bowhead Whales belonging to the East Canada â West Greenland subpopulation are observed in Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, Gulf of Boothia, Prince Regent Inlet, and other waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Tracking of satellite-tagged whales has confirmed movements from Foxe Basin through Fury and Hecla Strait into the Gulf of Boothia and Prince Regent Inlet, and from Cumberland Sound into Prince Regent Inlet, Gulf of Boothia, Foxe Basin, and Hudson Strait, while animals tagged in West Greenland moved to Prince Regent Inlet and Hudson Strait (Heide-JÃ¸rgensen <em>et al</em>. 2012). The whales move out of the summering areas as ice forms in autumn to wintering areas in polynyas (Holst and Stirling 1999), unconsolidated pack ice, and open water near the ice edge off West Greenland (Reeves and Heide-JÃ¸rgensen 1996) and eastern Baffin Island. Sightings and strandings have occurred in recent years in the western North Atlantic as far south as Newfoundland (Ledwell <em>et al.</em> 2007) and the Gulf of Maine (Accardo <em>et al.</em> in press).</p>  The East Greenland â Svalbard â Barents Sea subpopulation occurs from the east coast of Greenland across the Greenland Sea, including the Northeast Water polynya off northeastern Greenland, in the Barents Sea, in the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, and in the Kara Sea at least as far as far as Severnaya Zemlya. There have also been sightings further south, exceptionally reaching Iceland and the coast of Finnmark. Vagrants have been observed as far south as the western British Isles and France (de Boer <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation occurs in the northern and western Sea of Okhotsk from Shantarskiye Zaliv east to Zaliv Shelikova, Gizhiginskaya Guba, and Penzhinskaya Guba (Moore and Reeves 1993,&#160;Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is no evidence of migration into or out of the Okhotsk Sea.","<p></p><p></p><p>Limited subsistence whaling on the Bering â Chukchi â Beaufort subpopulation by indigenous people of Alaska and Chukotka is permitted by the IWC on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (under its aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure). Small&#160;hunts are also authorized in Canadian waters under co-management agreements between federal agencies and indigenous communities, and in West Greenland under the IWC management procedure. The reported average annual take in Alaska and Chukotka during 2006-15 was about 55 animals struck of which about 75% were successfully landed (Allison 2017, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>",Marine,"<p>Bowhead Whales were legally protected from commercial whaling under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor the Convention on the Regulation of Whaling since the 1930s.

Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling of Bowhead Whales is allowed by the IWC (the regulatory body established under the ICRW) from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock and off West Greenland on the basis of scientific advice (see <em>Threats</em> section). Hunting by indigenous people in Canada is co-managed by the federal government and regional bodies created under land-claim agreements.

50351457,2763,Berardius bairdii,Least Concern,,2020,2020-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>There is limited global information on abundance and none on trends in abundance for this species. It is relatively common with a broad range endemic to the cold waters of the North Pacific. Trends in abundance have been stable in waters off the U.S. west coast where corresponding trends for mesoplodonts have been negative, possibly due to the effects of anthropogenic noise. Bairdâs Beaked Whales are taken in Japanâs small-type whaling operations (annual quota around 60). One Bairdâs Beaked Whale was reported as dying from entanglement in the large-mesh gillnet fishery off the western United States; bycatch of ziphiids (beaked whales ) in this fishery has been eliminated through pinger use. Given that this species is relatively common and is known to have persisted in stable numbers within a large portion of its range, it is considered Least Concern. However, it is likely that other subpopulations exist especially around Japan where they are still hunted (Kasuya 2017), and once they are better identified they could be assessed separately.</p>","<p>Though they may be seen close to shore where deep water approaches the coast, Baird's Beaked Whales' primary habitat is on or near the continental slope and near oceanic seamounts (Kasuya 2002) in temperate oceanic waters 1,000 to 3,000 m deep. Off the Pacific coast of Japan, these whales have been recorded in water temperatures ranging between 23Â°C and 29Â°C, with a southern limit at the 15Â°C isotherm at a depth of 100 m.</p><p>Baird's Beaked Whales feed mainly on deepwater and bottom-dwelling gadiform fishes and cephalopods &#160;(Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2002), as well as some pelagic fishes, such as mackerel, sardines, and saury. The diet off the Pacific coast of Japan consists of 82% fish and 18% cephalopods, while in the southern Sea of Okhotsk the proportions are 13% and 87%, respectively (Walker <em>et al. </em>2002).</p>","<p>Bairdâs Beaked Whale is the only species of ziphiid to be commercially hunted (Kasuya and Ohsumi 1984, Kasuya 2017). Small numbers have been hunted by whalers from the Soviet Union, Canada and the United States mainly between 1930s to 1960s, whereas the hunting in Japan has been more consistent and substantial. The Japanese fishery started in the early 1600s and underwent several expansions and declines. At its peak, after World War II, over 300 whales were killed annually.&#160; Between 2005-2013 the quota for small-type whaling was 66/year (10 for the Sea of Japan [Hakodate], 4 for the southern Okhotsk Sea [Abashiri] and 52 for the Pacific coast [Wadaura, Ayukawa] Kasuya 2017).<br/> <br/> Incidental catches are reported infrequently. Some Baird's Beaked Whales have been caught in Japanese salmon driftnets (Ohsumi 1974). Artukhin <em>et al</em>. (2010) reported that beaked whales, most likely this species, were taken as bycatch in Japanese driftnet fishery in the Russian EEZ north of the Commander Islands and the southern part the Sea of Okhotsk. The estimated annual mortality rate in 1992-2008 was 4 (1-7) individuals. The fishery was closed in 2016. One Bairdâs Beaked Whale was reported as dying from entanglement in the large-mesh gillnet fishery off the western United States;&#160; bycatch of ziphiids (beaked whales ) in this fishery has been eliminated through pinger use (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including <em>Ziphius cavirostris</em> and several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160; One mass stranding event involving Bairdâs Beaked Whales is known from Japan and two from Mexico.&#160; Changes in the behavior of Bairdâs Beaked Whales in response to simulated sonar have been observed (Stimpert&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; However, off the U.S. west coast where anthropogenic noise has been implicated in declines in mesoplodonts (Moore and Barlow 2013), there was no apparent decline in Bairdâs Beaked Whales (Moore and Barlow 2017).&#160; </p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other beaked whales (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and such residues represent a potential health hazard. In Bairdâs Beaked Whales, Subramanian <em>et al.&#160;</em>(1988) reported values for PCBs and DDE , which are low when compared to other toothed whales. Organochlorine and halogenated dimethylbipyrroles residues have been identified in Bairdâs Beaked Whales (Prudente <em>et al. </em>1997, Haraguchi <em>et al. </em>2006) and various other species of mesoplodonts beaked whales&#160; (Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/> <br/> Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, given its cool-temperate to sub-Arctic habitat preference, although the nature of likely impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>","Three subpopulations of Bairdâs Beaked Whales are recognized in the western North Pacific (Sea of Japan, Okhotsk Sea, and Pacific Ocean), where these whales have been exploited in the Pacific coast of Japan for centuries. However, nothing is known about population structure in the eastern and central North Pacific. &#160;Abundance in Japanese waters has been estimated at about 7,100 individuals (5,029 off the Pacific coast, 1,468 in the eastern Sea of Japan, and 663 in the southern Okhotsk Sea â Kasuya 2017). These are likely underestimates because the analysis methods did not account for whales missed due to their long dive times (Barlow 1999). A trend-based analysis of line-transect data from all surveys conducted off the U.S. west coast between 1991 and 2014 yielded an estimate of abundance of 2,697 (CV=0.60) whales (Moore and Barlow 2017) and an apparently stable trend. Barlow (2016) estimated Bairdâs Beaked Whale abundance in the California Current at 5,394 (CV=0.83) and 7,960 (CV=0.93) whales for surveys conducted in 2008 and 2014, respectively. These estimates are higher than previously-published estimates for this region because they include lower estimates of trackline detection probability, g(0), based on Beaufort sea state-specific estimates of detectability for <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Barlow 2015).",Unknown,"<p>Baird's Beaked Whales are found in deep oceanic cold-temperate waters of the North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent&#160;Okhotsk and Bering Seas. Their range extends to the southern Gulf of California, Mexico, in the east and central Honshu, Japan, in the west. They also occur in the vicinity of drift ice in the northern Sea of Okhotsk. Off the Pacific coast of Japan, they migrate into waters over the continental slope from May to October, but where they go in winter is not known. They also occur in the northern Sea of Japan south to the Korean Peninsula. Their distributional limits in oceanic waters of the mid-Pacific are also not well known (Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2002).</p>",This species is hunted for food in Japan.,Marine,"<p>To date, the question of whether the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has the competence to classify or set catch limits for this species has not been formally resolved, even though Bairdâs Beaked Whale is included in the IWC definition of ""bottlenose whale"".

50352086,4161,Cephalorhynchus heavisidii,Near Threatened,C1,2018,2017-09-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of Heavisideâs Dolphins is limited to the Benguela ecosystem (the shelf waters of the west coast of South Africa, Namibia, and southern Angola). Recent research indicates a relatively large population at the southern limit of the species range: estimated population size is 6,345 individuals (95% CI 3,573â11,267) along ~ 390 km of coastline from Table Bay to Lambertâs Bay (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009), with further unpublished research indicating similar population densities at two sites in Namibia (Elwen unpublished data). Thus, it can be inferred that there are certainly &gt;1,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The species does not appear to clearly meet any of the Red List Criteria for a threatened status. However, there is considerable uncertainty around both population structure and total population size and there is no information on trend. Several threats have been identified, including entanglement in a variety of inshore fishing gears (e.g., beach seines, purse seines, trawls, and gillnets). Additionally, competition with Hake (<em>Merluccius</em> spp.) fisheries may represent an indirect threat, as although Heavisideâs Dolphins remain largely inshore of the fishing activity, juvenile hake are significant prey. Potentially emerging threats include an experimental mid-water trawl fishery for Horse Mackerel (<em>Trachurus capensis</em>) operating off the west coast of South Africa and industrial development, notably marine phosphate mining on the Namibian shelf, and port and mining infrastructure expansion projects in both Walvis Bay and LÃ¼deritz, two high-density areas for Heavisideâs Dolphins. As this species is limited by water temperature, climate change represents an additional emerging threat.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Guidelines state that âif LC, NT, and VU are considered to be equally plausible categories, the taxon may be categorized as NT.â In the absence of quantitative data from areas outside the Table BayâLambertâs Bay segment of coastline, the possibility that there are &lt;10,000 mature individuals cannot be ruled out, nor can a projected continuing decline of at least 10% over three generations given the known and emerging threats. Therefore, it is plausible that the species meets criterion C for VU but it is also plausible that number of mature individuals in unstudied parts of the range would push the total above 10,000. As a near-shore species with a very restricted range in a poorly studied region, Heavisideâs Dolphin is considered Near Threatened. This lends emphasis to the importance of quantifying mortality rates and improving estimates of abundance for the total species range.</p>","<p>Heavisideâs Dolphin is a coastal, shelf-dwelling species seen mainly in waters less than 100 m deep (Best and Abernethy 1994) throughout the cold, northward-flowing Benguela Current. More than 85% of sightings have been in water with surface temperatures of 9-15Â°C (Best and Abernethy 1994). Evidence from photo-identification (Elwen 2008, Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b) and satellite-linked tagging (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2014) indicated small home ranges between 50 and 80 km along shore, but with some animals also moving offshore to at least the 100 m isobath.<br/><br/>Throughout most of their range, Heavisideâs Dolphins show a strong diurnal <span class=""msoIns"">i<span class=""msoDel"">nshore-offshore movement pattern (Elwen <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2010) driven by resting and socializing inshore by day and nocturnal foraging in deep water on prey associated with the deep scattering layer. The dominant prey taken by Heavisideâs Dolphins are shallow-water species or life-stages, for example juvenile Hake (<em>Merluccius capensis</em>), Goby (<em>Sufflogobius bibartus</em>) and Horse Mackerel, as well as cephalopods, including octopus (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1992). Most fish eaten by Heavisideâs Dolphins are well below the modal length of commercially caught fish (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1992), and there is little spatial overlap in fishing effort and dolphin habitat (Fairweather <em>et al.</em> 2006).</span></p>","<p>In general, Heavisideâs Dolphins appear to face fewer threats than other members of its genus. Although fully protected legally, some killing with hand-thrown harpoons or guns was reported in the past (Rice and Saayman 1984, Best and Abernethy 1994). Heavisideâs Dolphins are susceptible to entanglement in inshore fishing gears such as beach seines, purse seines, trawls, and gillnets (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Bycatch in commercial fisheries appears to be low, although an experimental mid-water trawl fishery for Horse Mackerel operating off the South Africa west coast is of concern. Heavisideâs Dolphin bycatch must be monitored and the potential effects of the full-scale operation should be considered if there is evidence of significant mortality of dolphins in this fishery.<br/><br/>Information on organochlorine pollutant levels in a small sample of Heavisideâs Dolphins from the South African west coast indicated no significant exposure to DDT (De Kock <em>et al</em>. 1994). A more recent analysis of heavy metals in the skin of Heavisideâs Dolphins from South Africa and Namibia revealed that while levels were higher than expected for some metals, sampled individuals were deemed to be at low risk of lethal poisoning (Serot 2013). The scarcity of arable land, low rainfall and scarcity of rivers throughout the species range may help to limit pollutants entering the marine environment.<br/><br/>The impacts of marine mining, notably sediment dredging for phosphates, on the marine environment are not well understood but include direct destruction of the seabed and benthic fauna, release of hazardous material into the ocean, and reduced light penetration (Currie 2012). In addition, proposed onshore processing plants, at least in Namibia, are in or near known high use areas for the species at the ports of Walvis Bay and LÃ¼deritz.<br/><br/>Due to the limited range of temperatures occupied by the animals within the Benguela Ecosystem (a cold-water system surrounded by warmer waters), Heavisideâs Dolphins have been identified as one of the cetacean species most at risk from large perturbations associated with global climate change (MacLeod 2009).<br/><br/>Low human population densities and the scarcity of large ports along most of the speciesâ range probably help reduce adverse effects from boat traffic at a population level, although high site fidelity of the species may result in localized impacts.</p>","<p>No range-wide survey has been conducted for Heaviside's Dolphins. However, abundance estimates from photographic mark-recapture studies are available at several locations in South Africa and Namibia. A three-year study between Cape Town and Lambertâs Bay, South Africa estimated 527 animals (95% confidence interval (CI) 272â1,020) using 20 km of coastline in western Saint Helena Bay over six weeks of survey effort; 3,429 animals (95% CI 1,721â6,828), using the 150 km of coastline around Saint Helena Bay, over three summer seasons; and 6,345 animals (95% CI 3,573â11,267) using the full ~390 km of coastline from Table Bay to Lambertâs Bay (estimated between two summer field seasons; Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b). Sighting rates within this latter area ranged from 0 to nearly 2 groups per km (mean group size = 4.5, for 10 km long sections of coastline; Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Estimates are also available from two high-use areas in Namibia (Walvis Bay: 508 animals, 95% CI 461â833, over eight weeks; and LÃ¼deritz: 494 animals, 95% CI 403â607, 14 survey days within one year).<br/><br/>The species has exhibited high site fidelity over several years (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b) and this may affect population structure and limit gene flow between high-density sites. An assessment of genetic diversity and population genetic structure was conducted for this species using both mtDNA control region sequences and 13 microsatellite loci using 395 biopsy skin samples collected from free-ranging dolphins along the South African (Table Bay, Saint Helena Bay, Lambertâs Bay, Hondeklipbaai, and Port Nolloth) and Namibian (LÃ¼deritz and Walvis Bay) coastlines. Both genetic markers rejected the hypothesis of one homogeneous population, but results were somewhat contrasting. MtDNA control region data indicated six genetically differentiated putative populations among the seven sampling sites, with Hondeklipbaai and Port Nolloth grouping as one subpopulation, whilst the microsatellite data provided a different, but not mutually exclusive, signal, clustering the dolphins into a northern population (comprised of Lambertâs Bay, Hondeklipbaai, Port Nolloth, LÃ¼deritz Bay, and Walvis Bay) and a southern population that included the animals in Table Bay and St. Helena Bay (Gopal 2014). Overall, there appear to be two primary populations (northern and southern), but within each there is some limited structure suggesting that gene flow is not entirely open between sites. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution of the mitochondrial sequences indicated a departure from mutation-drift equilibrium due to a population expansion at the two extremes of the geographic range, but not towards the middle of the distribution. Small but significant genetic differentiation was indicated by the two markers (Gopal 2014). Whilst considerable progress was made towards understanding the population genetic structure of Heaviside's dolphins in this first study that covered a large geographic range, further genetic research, including information on relatedness, kin associations, and mating patterns, would improve understanding of population status and facilitate identification of management units for conservation.</p>",Unknown,"Heavisideâs Dolphins have a limited range, restricted to southwestern Africa (southern Angola to Cape Point, South Africa), with records from about 17Â°S to the southwestern tip of the continent. They are commonly seen along the west coast of South Africa in the Cape Town region (Rice 1998, Dawson 2002). Records extend along the entire west coast of South Africa and Namibia, and into southern Angola (Best 2007), with the exact northern limit of the species range poorly known, but possibly variable due to natural fluctuations in water temperature at the northern end of the Benguela ecosystem.","Some illegal hunting has been reported, but it is probably not at a significant level (Best and Abernethy 1994, Best 2007). There is presently no known trade in the region, although some localized, illegal hunting or opportunistic use of by-caught animals may still take place on the South African west coast. No data are available on directed catches or bycatch in Angola.",Marine,"<p></p><p></p><p>Heavisideâs Dolphins are  listed in Appendix II of the Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species.<br/> <br/> More information is needed on the distribution of the species in Angolan waters in particular, as well as on the nature and extent of incidental catches. More research emphasis should in future also be placed on possible detrimental interactions due to the overfishing of prey stocks, especially Hake. Increased inshore fishing pressure will inevitably increase interactions between the fisheries and Heavisideâs Dolphins (Peddemors 1999).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The only definitely surviving breeding population is in the eastern North Pacific. The North Atlantic breeding population is extinct, and the western North Pacific breeding population is possibly extinct.</p>","Gray Whales are unusual for large whales. They are primarily bottom feeders and are thus restricted to shallow continental shelf waters for feeding. They are largely coastal although they do occur at greater distances from shore on the shallow continental shelf of the Bering and Chukchi seas (Rice and Wolman (1971). Gray whales feed primarily on swarming mysids, tube-dwelling amphipods, and polychaete tube worms in the northern parts of their range, but are also known to take red crabs, baitfish, and other food (crab larvae, mobile amphipods, herring eggs and larvae, cephalopods, and megalops larvae) opportunistically or off the main feeding grounds (Nerini 1984). In one of their main feeding grounds in the Chukchi Sea, Gray Whale densities were highest in areas with high benthic amphipod abundance (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2016). Gray Whale feeding may have a dramatic effect on benthic invertebrate communities (Oliver and Slattery 1985). <br/><br/>Gray Whales are often preyed upon by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em> (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2007).","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Gray Whales have been hunted since prehistoric times, and were particularly vulnerable to whalers due to their slow swimming speeds and coastal distribution. The North Atlantic population was extinct by the early 1700s, although it is unclear whether this was due primarily to hunting (Mead and Mitchell 1984). Gray Whales were hunted in prehistoric times on both sides of the North Pacific, but aboriginal catches declined to relatively low levels by the early 20th century due largely to depletion of the stocks by commercial whaling (Mitchell 1979).</p>  <p></p>  <p>Over-exploitation had been thought to have caused the extinction of the western North Pacific breeding population by the 1970s (Bowen 1974) but its probable continued existence in some form is noted above. The eastern North Pacific breeding population had reached such low numbers by the end of the 19th century that commercial whaling ceased, but it has now recovered to at or near carrying capacity, its abundance showing some fluctuation in response to environmental conditions. </p>  <p>Gray Whales are subject to anthropogenic threats such as entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes. Scordino <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated about 10 fatalities per year in the eastern North Pacific and the Bering Sea resulting from known incidents during 2010-15, of which ~80% involved entanglement in fishing gear and ~20% from ship strikes. The threat seems small in relation to the population size of 25,000-30,000 animals, but there are fisheries with little observer coverage, such as the Alaska gillnet fisheries, such that total mortality rates may be higher (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; </p>  <p>Entanglement rates in the western North Pacific appear to have been comparatively high relative to abundance: out of only 18 records of Gray Whales on the Pacific coast of Japan during 2000-16, there were 10 live sightings, 4 entanglements, and 4 strandings (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2016). No further entanglements in Japanese waters have been reported since 2008 when Gray Whales in Japan acquired legal protection against deliberate killing and commercial utilization, but it is unclear whether this is coincidental. A Gray Whale death from entanglement was recorded in the Taiwan Strait in 2011 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/></p>  <p>Salmon trap nets have been set at least since 2013 in Gray Whale  feeding grounds off northeastern Sakhalin, with at least one observed entanglement and at least one probable entanglement death (Lowry <em>et al</em>. submitted). Based on analysis of photographs, approximately 20% of Gray Whales observed off Sakhalin during 1995-2005 showed evidence of scarring from past entanglements (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2009), but it is not known where the scars were acquired. <br/></p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Seven to eight times more gray whales than average washed ashore on the US coast in 1999 and 2000, but the causes of this unusual mortality event have not been conclusively identified (Gulland <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  Perryman <em>et al</em>. (2002) and Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that Gray Whale  calf production is positively correlated with the length of the ice-free season in the main feeding grounds in the preceding season. While this would imply that reduced ice coverage, as predicted by most climate models, could benefit Gray Whales in the short term, the longer term effects of arctic climate change on Gray Whales are unknown. There is some evidence that the distribution on the winter breeding grounds shifts northward in warm (El NiÃ±o) years and southward in cool (La NiÃ±a) years (Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. 2015). This trend seems to have continued in 2015 and 2016, with lower Gray Whale counts in the more southerly Bahia Magdalena Lagoon complex (24-25Â°N) compared to the previous years and with water temperatures 2.0-3.5Â° higher than in 2012-13 (UrbÃ¡n <em>et al</em>. 2016). The conservation implications in the context of a general trend towards higher water temperatures and more frequent El NiÃ±o conditions are unclear.<p></p>  Plastic debris has been found in stomachs of dead Gray Whales but does not appear to have been a significant factor in the deaths of the individuals concerned.","<p></p><p>Gray Whales in the eastern North Pacific were rapidly depleted by commercial whalers after the wintering concentrations in lagoons along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, were discovered in the mid-19th century. Peak catches, averaging over 480 whales per year, occurred between 1855 and 1865. Lagoon whaling ended by about 1875, apparently due to exhaustion of the lagoon populations, but shore-based whaling in California continued at a lower level until the late 19th century (Henderson 1984, IWC 1993, Reeves and Smith 2010). In the 20th century, there were some pelagic catches off California and Mexico by Norwegian and American vessels in the 1920s and 1930s, and in the 1930s and 1940s by the Soviet pelagic fleet in the Bering and Chukchi seas (Allison 2017). A further 320 Gray Whales were taken under scientific permit in the 1960s (Rice and Wolman 1971), and 138 illegal Soviet catches occurred in the 1960s (Doroshenko 2000). âAboriginal subsistenceâ whaling resumed in the Bering and Chukchi seas off Chukotka in 1948 and has continued into the present, apart from an interruption in the early 1990s. Reported catches during the years 1985-2016 averaged 118 per year. Very small numbers have also been taken by aboriginal whalers in Alaska, and by the Makah tribe in Washington State (IWC 2017). <br/></p>  <p>Despite the continuing catches, the eastern North Pacific population has recovered strongly from past over-exploitation, increasing by 2.5% per year during 1967-96 (Buckland and Breiwick 2002). Abundance seems to have peaked around 1997/98 when a census on the southward migration indicated a population of 24,000-36,000 (Laake <em>et al</em>. 2012). There followed a reduction in population size, with some recovery in recent years. The most recent abundance estimate is 26,960 (95% confidence interval 24,420-29,830) from the 2015/16 southbound migration survey off California (Durban <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2017).&#160; <br/></p>  <p>There was a downturn in population condition around the turn of the millenium involving poor calf production, high stranding rates, and relatively high numbers of emaciated animals (LeBouef <em>et al.</em> 2000, IWC 2003, Rugh <em>et al.</em> 2005). An observed die-off involved at least 651 whales between 1999 and 2001 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Perryman <em>et al.</em> (2002) showed that calf production was related to the proportion of feeding habitat free of sea ice in the preceding summer. Since 2002, calf production has recovered, and mortality and the occurrence of emaciated whales have declined (IWC 2004). The presence of female-calf pairs has also recently increased in Laguna San Ignacio, Baja California Sur (Swartz <em>et al</em>. 2012). The population has probably reached a size where it exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment in years when food availability is below average, and is likely to fluctuate around some environmentally determined average level.</p><p>The Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) was estimated at 243 whales (standard error 19) in 2015 and has shown some increase in recent years (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; <br/></p>The combined feeding aggregations off northeastern Sakhalin and southeastern Kamchatka were estimated to number 271-311 whales (excluding calves) in 2016, of which 175-192 were predominantly Sakhalin-feeding whales. The Sakhalin component has been increasing at 2-5% per year. Based on evidence of migration to the eastern North Pacific from tags and photo-identification matches between Sakhalin/Kamchatka and Mexico, it was estimated that at most 100 of the Sakhalin/Kamchatka whales migrate to wintering grounds in the western North Pacific (Cooke 2017). <p>Given documented catches of about 2,000 gray whales in Korean waters  during 1890-1966 (Kato and Kasuya 2002), and the lack of sightings in  Korean waters since 1977, the western breeding population, if it still  exists, is likely at a very small fraction of its original abundance.<br/></p>",Stable,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>Gray Whales are now regularly found only in the North Pacific and adjacent seas. They congregate in winter in or around various lagoons along the west coast of Baja California (Mexico) and small numbers also occur in winter in the Gulf of California and along the Mexican mainland. Some calves are born during the southward migration and the remainder are born in shallow bays and lagoons on the west coast of Baja California (Jones and Swartz 2002). In spring, the population migrates to feeding grounds mainly in the shallow waters of the northwestern Bering Sea and the southern Chukchi and Beaufort seas, with some individuals migrating as far westward as Kamchatka and Sakhalin, Russia (Weller <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mate <em>et al</em>. 2015). Some Gray Whales also summer and feed along the Pacific coast of North America from northern California to Kodiak Island, Alaska; those animals are known as the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p></p>Former whaling grounds off Korea and southwestern Japan indicate the existence of a separate western North Pacific or Asian population that migrated to breeding grounds south of the Korean Peninsula, based on the seasonality of catches in the Korean grounds (Weller <em>et al</em>. 2002, Kato and Kasuya 2002). The last sighting in Korean waters was in 1977, and recent surveys in Korean waters have failed to find any Gray Whales (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Gray Whales, including mothers with calves, return every year to a feeding ground off northeastern Sakhalin (Weller <em>et al</em>.  1999). This group was until recently thought to be a remnant of the  western breeding stock that was exploited in the Korean whaling grounds;  the Russian name âKorean-Okhotsk gray whaleâ for this population was  based on this assumption. Tracking with satellite-linked tags and  photo-matching data (Mate <em>et al</em>. 2015, Weller <em>et al</em>.  2012) show that at least some of the Sakhalin whales migrate to the  eastern North Pacific in winter. However, the number of movements  recorded to date has not been sufficient to conclude that all Gray  Whales observed off Sakhalin belong to the eastern breeding population  (Cooke <em>et al.</em> 2017, IWC 2017).  <br/>  <p>Since 1990, about 30 sightings and strandings have been documented in Japan, mainly on the Pacific coast (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2016). These include at least one reproductive female moving between Sakhalin and Japan and one individual seen in successive years alternately off Sakhalin in summer and off Japan in winter and spring (Weller <em>et al</em>. 2016, Nakamura <em>et al</em>. 2017). There have also been a few strandings on the coast of mainland China from the northern Yellow Sea to the Hainan Strait in the south (Zhu and Yue 1998), and one animal caught in fishing gear in the Taiwan Strait in 2011 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015). Therefore, at least some of the Gray Whales that feed in the Okhotsk Sea migrate into Japanese waters and possibly farther south in winter;&#160;these may be a remnant of the historical Asian Gray Whale population, but it is not known whether there exists an Asian calving and nursery aggregation, as occurs in Baja California. <br/> <br/> Gray Whales were once present in the North Atlantic as well as the North Pacific. Sub-fossil remains, the most recent dated to around 1675, have been found on the eastern seaboard of North America from Florida to New Jersey and on the coasts of the English Channel and the North and Baltic seas (Mead and Mitchell 1984). There are historical accounts of living Gray Whales from Iceland in the early 1600s and possibly off New England in the early 1700s (Rice 1998). </p>  A few rare occurrences of Gray Whales outside their normal range have recently been documented. One was seen in May 2010 in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel, and a few days later again off Spain (Scheinin <em>et al.</em> 2011). A Gray Whale was found stranded on the coast of El Salvador in July 2010, the southernmost record known in the Pacific Ocean (previously, the southernmost record was in BahÃ­a de Banderas, Mexico) (Barraza 2011). A Gray Whale was seen in May 2013 off Namibia, possibly a juvenile and the only report to date of a Gray Whale in the Southern Hemisphere (Elwen and Gridley 2013).","<p>Commercial whaling of Gray Whales has ceased, but aboriginal subsistence whaling continues, primarily off Chukotka with a few taken in some years in Alaska. The IWC permitted a catch of 744 Gray Whales during the years 2013-18 with a maximum of 140 in any one year.</p>",Marine,"<p>Gray Whales have been protected from commercial whaling by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor convention since 1936. Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling is permitted by the IWC, and catch limits have been set since the 1970s on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (most recently under its new aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure) and requests from the relevant governments (Russian Federation and U.S.A.). The current (2013-2018) catch limit for the eastern subpopulation is 744 for the six years, subject to a maximum of 140 in any single year (IWC 2017). </p>  Three Gray Whale breeding lagoons in Mexico (Laguna Ojo de Liebre, Laguna San Ignacio, and Laguna Guerrero Negro) enjoy some protection in the form of limitations on boating, fishing, and coastal development, originally as National Gray Whale Refuges, now through their inclusions in the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, which is also listed internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Ramsar protected wetland (Hoyt 2005).<br/> <br/> The Gray Whale has a measure of legal protection in Russian waters through inclusion in the Russian Federation Red Book of Threatened Species: the Korean-Okhotsk subpopulation is listed as Endangered while the eastern North Pacific population, which migrates in Russian waters in summer, is listed as âRecovery and Restorationâ. The Gray Whale has been legally protected in Japan since 2008: deliberate killing and commercial utilization are prohibited.

50354433,8551,Feresa attenuata,Least Concern,,2018,2017-03-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Although Pygmy Killer Whales occur worldwide, they appear to be naturally uncommon everywhere. The sum of existing abundance estimates is approximately 40,000 animals, however surveys have covered only a very small portion of its range and therefore total abundance is likely much higher. They are killed incidentally in low numbers in longline fisheries and probably in gillnet fisheries and they are occasionally targeted in direct hunts.<br/><br/>Pygmy Killer Whales were listed as Data Deficient in 2008 and the species remains extremely data poor for most of its range. However, they appear to be naturally rare and no threats are considered significant or pervasive. There is no indication of large-scale mortality or population declines and therefore the species is listed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern. Significant threats may exist and declines in abundance may have gone undetected. Relatively little human-caused mortality could cause population decline in a species with such low abundance and declines would be difficult to detect given the low density. Therefore, this listing should be considered provisional pending more information.</p>","<p>The Pygmy Killer Whale occurs in deep, warm waters, generally beyond the edge of the continental shelf, and rarely close to shore (except near some oceanic island groups where the water is deep and clear). This species is mainly tropical and occasionally strays into warm temperate regions. A long-term study at Hawaii Island suggested that there is a small resident population with long-term site fidelity to the island (McSweeney <em>et al.</em> 2009, Baird <em>et al.</em> 2011). Around Hawaii group sizes ranged from 4 to 33 individuals, sightings were in depths ranging from 113 to 2,862 m, and they were located 2.8 to 16 km from shore (McSweeney <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Pygmy Killer Whales feed on both cephalopods (squid and octopus) and fish (Elorriaga-Verplancken <em>et al</em>. 2016). They have occasionally been recorded attacking dolphins associated with tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific (Perryman and Foster 1980).</p>","<p>Because of their relatively low abundance, even small takes could be sufficient to cause declines of this species in local areas.<br/><br/>Pygmy Killer Whales, like beaked whales, Melon-Headed Whales and possibly other species, are likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by military sonar and seismic surveys (Cox <em>et al</em>. 2006, Southall <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2016). A review of mass strandings of this species identified Taiwan as a hotspot with 25% of the events that occurred since 1995 taking place in a relatively small section of coastline in the southwest of the country. Three additional near mass stranding events were documented in Taiwan between 1995 and 2005. The most plausible explanation for these mass stranding and near mass stranding events, at least around Taiwan, was anthropogenic sound (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wang and Yang 2006).<br/><br/>Pygmy Killer Whales have been killed in small numbers in harpoon, drive, or driftnet fisheries in the Caribbean islands, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Japan and Indonesia (Ross and Leatherwood 1994, Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005, Baird 2018). Reports on the small-cetacean fisheries of Saint Vincent (West Indies) and Lamalera (Indonesia) suggest that Pygmy Killer Whales form a very small proportion of the dolphin catch. In Sri Lanka, they were reported to be harpooned for use as bait on longlines for sharks, billfish, and other oceanic fishes (Ross and Leatherwood 1994).<br/><br/>Although Pygmy Killer Whales comprised less than 2% of all cetaceans bycaught in gillnet fisheries in Trincomalee and in villages on the south-west coast of Sri Lanka, this may have amounted to 300-900 Pygmy Killer Whales each year (Ross and Leatherwood 1994). Small incidental catches are known to have occurred in fisheries in other areas including the Philippines, Taiwan, and Ghana (Ross and Leatherwood 1994, Dolar 1994, Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Debrah <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>In the U.S. Pacific the total fishery mortality and serious injury to Pygmy Killer Whales was considered to be insignificant and approaching zero (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Similarly, there was no reported fishing-related mortality of Pygmy Killer Whales during 1998-2010 in the northern Gulf of Mexico and U.S. Atlantic waters (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Although the number of Pygmy Killer Whales documented to have been killed accidentally or intentionally is small, the monitoring of fisheries in most parts of their range is poor or non-existent. In the long term, taking could have a significant impact on Pygmy Killer Whales where their distribution overlaps areas with extensive gillnetting operations (Ross and Leatherwood 1994). </p>","<p>  </p><p>Pygmy Killer Whales have been recorded from the waters of more than 100 countries, however there is very little information on population biology or abundance. The species appears to be naturally rare throughout its range. Wade and Gerrodette (1993) estimated that there were about 38,900 (coefficient of variation (CV)=31%) of these whales in the eastern tropical Pacific from surveys conducted between 1986 and 1990. It was noted that of the 13 species for which population estimates were generated in that study, Pygmy Killer Whales ranked 12th in abundance (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). The best abundance estimate available for Pygmy Killer Whales in the northern Gulf of Mexico is 152 (CV=102%). This estimate was from a summer 2009 survey covering waters from the 200 m isobath to the seaward extent of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). A 2010 shipboard line-transect survey of the Hawaiian Islands EEZ resulted in an abundance estimate of 3,433 (CV=52%) (Bradford<em> et al.</em> 2013, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). In a 22-year study of cetaceans around the main Hawaiian Islands, this species was extremely uncommon, representing only 1.2% of odontocete sightings in directed survey efforts (McSweeney <em>et al</em>. 2009). Elsewhere in the species range, it has not been possible to estimate abundance because of insufficient sightings (e.g., Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2006) and the majority of publications specifically on this species describe single sightings or strandings (Allport <em>et al</em>. 2017, Chantrapornsyl 1996, Elorriaga-Verplancken <em>et al</em>. 2016, Jeyarbaskaran <em>et al.</em> 2011, Zerbini and Santos 1997).</p>  <p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Pygmy Killer Whales are distributed in tropical and subtropical oceanic waters worldwide, generally between 40Â°N and 35Â°S. They generally do not move close to shore, except in some areas where deep, clear water is near the coast, such as around oceanic archipelagos like Hawaii. This species does not occur regularly in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al. </em>2017, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Baldwin <em>et al.</em> 1999). There is a record from Ghana in West Africa (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2009) but there are almost no other records from the Atlantic coast of Africa which likely reflects both the speciesâ rarity and poor survey coverage (Weir 2010, 2011).

50355227,9249,Globicephala macrorhynchus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-06-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Short-finned Pilot Whale is a highly social species with a wide distribution in tropical and temperate waters around the globe. It is relatively common and abundant in some areas. The difficulty of distinguishing this species from the Long-finned Pilot Whale (<em>Globicephala melas</em>) at sea in areas where the two speciesâ ranges overlap compounds the problem of obtaining reliable estimates for such areas. The total of all available abundance estimates for Short-finned Pilot Whales is approximately 700,000 but large parts of the species range have not been surveyed and therefore actual abundance must be considerably greater than this. Information on trends in abundance at the global scale is lacking but a lack of threats over much of the range does not suggest declining trends.<br/><br/>The Short-finned Pilot Whale was listed&#160;on the IUCN Red List&#160;as Data Deficient in 2008 and the species remains data-poor in much of its range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere and in large parts of the tropical and warm temperate North Atlantic Ocean. However, these whales are widely distributed in warm waters of all oceans, they appear to be relatively abundant in many parts of their range, and no threats are considered significant or pervasive throughout the range of the species. There is no indication of large-scale mortality (other than by mass stranding, which is characteristic of both species of <em>Globicephala</em>) or population declines at present, and therefore the species is listed as Least Concern. The species has been hunted in Japan for many centuries and this continued exploitation may well have caused a significant decline in at least the near-shore waters of Japan.</p>","<p>Short-finned Pilot Whales are typically found in deep waters over the outer continental shelf or continental slope and are generally nomadic although resident or at least semi-resident populations have been documented in Hawaii (Van Cise<em> et al.</em> 2017), the Madeira Islands, and coastal California (Olson 2018). They occur in tropical to cool temperate waters, warmer than those preferred by Long-finned Pilot Whales which off the east coast of the United States were primarily found in sea surface temperatures &lt;22Â°C and were uncommon in temperatures &gt;25Â°C (Garrison and Rosel 2017).<br/><br/>In 1982â83, a strong El NiÃ±o event brought about major ecosystem changes off the southern California coast, an event linked with the virtual disappearance of Short-finned Pilot Whales from the area for a number of years (Barlow 2006). The speciesâ current distribution in the area is thought to be linked to seasonal and annual fluctuations in temperature and productivity (Forney and Barlow 1998, Barlow and Forney 2007, Pardo<em> et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Off the coast of Japan, the southern form of Short-finned Pilot Whale occurs within the warm Kuroshio Current and Kuroshio Counter Current, while the range of the northern form is limited to a smaller area within the cold, nutrient-rich Oyashio Current (Kasuya 2017). Pilot whales are primarily adapted to feeding on squid, with reduced tooth counts associated with suction feeding (Werth 2000), and some populations demonstrate deep, fast dives in pursuit of large, high calorie squid species (Aguilar Soto<em> et al.</em> 2008, Olson 2018). On the east coast of the United States, stranded Short-finned Pilot Whales were recorded to feed on a wide range of prey items, including the oceanic Common Arm Squid (<em>Brachioteuthis riisei</em>) as well as other predominantly oceanic squid and fish species (Mintzer<em> et al.</em> 2008). In contrast neritic squid of the genus <em>Loligo</em>&#160;were more commonly found in the stomachs of Short-finned Pilot Whales on the west coast of the United States (Sinclair 1992).</p>","<p>The Short-finned Pilot Whale has been exploited for centuries in the western North Pacific. The largest catches have recently occurred off Japan, where a few hundred are taken annually by hand- or crossbow-projected harpooning, driving, and small-type whaling (defined as the use of a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size) (Kasuya 2018). Catches from all cetacean hunts in Japan have been compiled since 1972 and the southern form comprises the vast majority of all Pilot Whale catches, which from 1972 to 2009 have annually ranged from 100 to about 500 (Kasuya 2017). From 1993-2004, the annual quota for all Short-finned Pilot Whale takes in Japan was 500, a large proportion of which was allocated to the drive hunt in Taiji. Since 1972, the largest reported catch in Taiji was 605 in 1980, and after that time catches in Taiji have ranged from tens of animals to several hundred, and the number taken has in general declined. The decline was assumed to be due to the low availability of animals (Kasuya 2017). The coastal population of southern-form whales is at least locally depleted and the coastal populations of both forms are listed as Rare (equivalent to Red List category Near Threatened) in the Japanese Red Data Book (Ohdachi <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales (called Blackfish locally) were regularly hunted for food as recently as the 1980s at several Caribbean islands (e.g., St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique), although recent and past documentation has been sporadic and often incomplete (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975, Price 1985, Reeves 1988). The hunt has continued at least in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where since 1962 the local hunters took an average of 141 Pilot Whales and 159 dolphins of various species annually through 2009 (Fielding 2013).<br/><br/>Dolar <em>et al</em>. (1994) reported on directed hunting of marine mammals in central and southern Visayas, northern Mindanao, and Palawan, Philippines. Hunters at four of the seven investigated fishing villages took cetaceans, including Short-finned Pilot Whales, for bait or human consumption. However, interview surveys conducted in these villages in 2012 indicated that the practice had ceased by that time, in part due to fear of legal prosecutions after the passing of Fisheries Administrative Order 185 banning direct cetacean takes in 1992 (L. Dolar pers. comm. 2018). Large deliberate catches of Short-finned Pilot Whales (&gt;500 in 1996-97) in âtiger netsâ in Indonesia were reported in the early 2000s (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005) but it was not clear whether this exploitation (for pet food) was continuing. The villages of Lamalera and Lamakera on two remote islands in the Savu Sea in Indonesia have conducted regular hunts for Sperm Whales (<em>Physeter macrocephalus</em>) and other species, including Short-finned Pilot Whales, since the 1600s, and the practice continues today, although numbers of Pilot Whales taken are not available (Mustika 2006, Emont 2017).<br/><br/>It is likely that Short-finned Pilot Whales are killed in moderate numbers in longline and drift gillnet fisheries throughout their range, but there is very little documentation from most range states. This species was noted to be the major depredator of longlines around Fiji (Donoghue<em> et al.</em> 2003). Short-finned Pilot Whales were one of the species documented as occasionally interacting with tuna fisheries in the western tropical Indian Ocean (Romanov 2002. Escalle<em> et al.</em> 2015). Around the island of Mayotte (northeastern Mozambique Channel), there is evidence of interaction between Short-finned Pilot Whales and long-line fisheries, inferred from non-lethal injuries on dorsal fins and information from fishermen (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2008). An unknown number are taken incidentally by large-mesh driftnets in Taiwan (Perrin<em> et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales are known to be incidentally taken in a deep-set longline fishery that targets primarily tunas in Hawaiian waters (Bradford and Forney 2014, Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2014) and also in a drift gillnet fishery off California (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). Bycatch of Short-finned Pilot Whales is more significant on the east coast of the United States where the estimated mean annual total estimated fisheries-related serious injury and mortality in the period of 2010-2014 was estimated at 233 (CV 0.24) and is cause for concern under provisions of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017). The most common human-related cause of death observed in waters off Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands was âentanglement and accidental capturesâ, followed by gunshots and spear wounds (Mignucci-Giannoni<em> et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>Like beaked whales and other deep diving species, Short-finned Pilot Whales are likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by naval sonar and seismic surveys (Cox<em> et al.</em> 2006, Weir 2008). While conclusive evidence of cause and effect are often lacking, some Short-finned Pilot Whale mass stranding events have been spatially and temporally associated with high levels of anthropogenic sound (Hohn<em> et al.</em> 2006, Parsons 2017). Around Taiwan and adjacent areas, a series of unusual strandings of Short-finned Pilot Whales coincided with large-scale military exercises in 2004, but whether these strandings were related to the exercises is unknown (Wang and Yang 2006, Yang<em> et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Moderate levels of various contaminants have been found in the blubber of Short-finned Pilot Whales, including mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorinated pesticides (DDT, DDE, dieldrin, etc.) (Gaskin<em> et al.</em> 1974, Simmonds<em> et al.</em> 2002). In Japan and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, levels of mercury, PCBs, dieldrin, and other contaminants in the blubber and meat from Pilot Whales and other species killed for food were considered above recommended levels for human consumption (Simmonds<em> et al.</em> 2002, Fielding and Evans 2014).</p><p></p>","<p>Estimates of abundance for Short-finned Pilot Whales exist for several areas. Line transect surveys in Japanese waters generated an abundance estimate of 53,609 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.22) for the southern form (Miyashita 1993) and an estimate of 4,321 (CV 0.61) for the northern form (IWC 1992). Dolar <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated abundance for two areas in the Philippines: the eastern Sulu Sea, 7,492 (CV 0.29) and the TaÃ±on Strait, 179 (CV 0.96). A line transect survey in the Eastern Tropical Pacific in 2000 generated an estimate of 589,000 (CV 0.26) Short-finned Pilot Whales, with a steadily increasing trend during the eight surveys that were conducted between 1986 and 2000, although immigration and emigration and slightly changing survey areas may also have influenced numbers from one year to the next (Gerrodette and Forcada 2002). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone&#160;(EEZ)&#160;in 2010 yielded an abundance estimate of 19,503 (CV 0.49) (Bradford<em> et al.</em> 2017). Trend data for Pilot Whales in this region are not available due to broad and overlapping confidence intervals between this and previous estimates (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). The best recent estimate for Short-finned Pilot Whales off the west coast of the USA is 836 (CV 0.79), based on the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys of California, Oregon, and Washington waters (Barlow 2016). The species was more abundant in this area prior to a strong El NiÃ±o event that resulted in apparent ecosystem changes in 1982-83, and it is unknown whether the animals present in smaller numbers now are part of the same population that was present before the 1980âs (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). A summer 2009 oceanic survey covering waters from the 200 m isobath to the seaward extent of the U.S. EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in an estimate of 2,415 Short-finned Pilot Whales (CV 0.66) (Waring<em> et al.</em> 2016). Two line transect surveys conducted in the summer of 2011 in the western Atlantic from central Florida to the lower Bay of Fundy yielded an estimate of 21,515 (CV 0.37) (Palka 2012. Garrison and Rosel 2017). Because this 2011 survey was the first in this region to distinguish between&#160;Short-finned and Long-finned Pilot Whales&#160;where the species overlap in range (Rone and Pace 2012, Garrison and Rosel 2017), comparison with earlier estimates to assess trends is not possible (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales are among the most frequently encountered cetaceans in the Canary Islands, although absolute estimates of abundance are not available (Carrillo <em>et al. </em>2010). They have been described as ârelatively abundantâ around the Maldives and in the northern Indian Ocean more generally (Ballance and Pitman 1998, Clark<em> et al.</em> 2012). Although there has been limited survey effort, the compiled records suggest that Short-finned Pilot Whales occur regularly in deep water off the west coast of Africa (Weir 2010).<br/><br/>While the estimates presented here give insight into abundance for some populations, there is no information on global numbers or trends (Olson 2018).</p>",Unknown,"<p>Short-finned Pilot Whales are found in warm temperate to tropical waters, generally in deep offshore areas. They do not usually range north of 50Â°N or south of 40Â°S (Olson 2018). There is some distributional overlap with Long-finned Pilot Whales, which occur primarily in cold temperate to subpolar waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017, Olson 2018).<br/><br/>Two forms of Short-Finned Pilot Whale are found off Japan with partially overlapping distributions (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1988, Van Cise<em> et al.</em> 2016). There is only one confirmed record of the species in the Mediterranean Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara 2016, Verborgh<em> et al.</em> 2016), and records from the southern Red Sea are considered uncertain and unconfirmed (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017). There are no confirmed accounts of <em>Globicephala</em> in the Persian Gulf (Leatherwood<em> et al.</em> 1991, de Boer<em> et al.</em> 2003, Preen 2004).

These factors may be causing declines in abundance that have gone undetected in areas which have been poorly, infrequently, or never surveyed. The Long-finned Pilot Whale was listed on the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient in 2008 and the species remains data-poor in much of its range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. However, these whales appear to be relatively abundant in many parts of their range, and apart from the substantial removals by direct hunting in the Faroes and Greenland, no threats are considered significant or pervasive throughout the range of the species. There is no indication of large-scale mortality (other than by mass stranding, which is characteristic of both species of <em>Globicephala</em>) or population declines at present, and therefore the species is listed on the Red List as Least Concern. However, the large takes in the Faroes that have occurred over many centuries may well have caused a significant reduction in abundance that has gone undetected in this highly social and wide-ranging species. Although fine-scaled population structure has not been detected, consideration should be given to separate assessment of the Southern Hemisphere and North Atlantic subspecies, with immediate priority given to the latter.</p><p></p>","<p>Primarily squid eaters, Long-finned Pilot Whales also take small and medium-sized fish, such as mackerel, when available (Gannon<em> et al. </em>1997<em>,</em> Santos<em> et al. </em>2014<em>,</em> Monteiro<em> et al. </em>2015). Other fish species taken include cod, turbot, herring, hake, and dogfish. They also sometimes eat shrimp (Gannon<em> et al. </em>1997).</p>  <p>In the western North Atlantic during winter and spring, Long-finned Pilot Whales occur in the highest densities over the continental slope. During late-summer and autumn the speciesâ distribution is more widespread throughout the waters over the shelf (Payne and Heinemann<em> </em>1993<em>,</em> Roberts <em>et al. </em>2016<em>,&#160;</em>Hayes<em> et al. </em>2017). In European Atlantic waters, Long-finned Pilot Whale sightings were distributed widely along the continental shelf edge and in oceanic waters, extending from the Strait of Gibraltar to the deep waters of the Rockall Trough around 60Â°N. No Pilot Whales were sighted in the North Sea or the Irish Sea. Depth, distance to the 2000 m depth contour, and latitude were found to be important variables for predicting abundance of Pilot Whale groups. This abundance was predicted to be highest in water depths &gt;1,000 m, was strongly associated with the 2,000 m depth contour, and showed geographic variation with latitude with a peak at 55Â°W (Rogan <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>The AlborÃ¡n Sea is one of the most important areas for this species in the Mediterranean (CaÃ±adas and Sagarminaga<em> </em>2000). In that area, the average depth of encounters was about 850 m (ranging from 300 to 1,800 m), reflecting the distribution of pelagic cephalopods in the region (de Stephanis<em> et al. </em>2008). Around the Faroe Islands, tracking studies showed a preference for deep waters beyond the continental shelf (Bloch<em> et al. </em>2003).</p>  <p>Off Chile, Aguayo <em>et al</em>. (1998) sighted Long-finned Pilot Whales mainly near the edge of the continental shelf. Goodall and Macnie (1998) reported on sightings in the eastern South Pacific, which were clustered from 30-35Â°S and 72-78Â°W, at a maximum of about 160 nm from shore. In the western South Atlantic, sightings were clustered in two areas, 34-46Â°S and off Tierra del Fuego, 52-56Â°S, where schools were found up to 1,000 nm from shore. Fifteen sightings were from waters south of the Antarctic Convergence, from December to March. Only one sighting was made south of 44Â°S in winter, probably due to lack of effort in southern seas during the colder months&#160;(Goodall and Macnie<em> </em>1998).</p>","<p></p><p>The only current hunts for Long-finned Pilot Whales (at least in the Northern Hemisphere) are undertaken at the Faroe Islands and Greenland. While the drive hunt in the Faroe Islands has been actively pursued since the 9th century, catch levels have apparently not caused stock depletion (NAMMCO<em> </em>2014). Catch records from the Faroes go as far back as 1584, and the catch data series is unbroken since 1709 (Bloch 1994).&#160; Although there appear to be long-term cyclical changes in Pilot Whale availability to the Faroese hunters, no indication of a trend was detected in an analysis of the catch records (Bloch and Lastein 1995). The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) Scientific Committee (2014) noted that under conservative assumptions a population of between 50,000-80,000 whales would be required to support the documented level of removals. NAMMCO is planning an in-depth assessment of North Atlantic Pilot Whales in 2019 (NAMMCO 2018a).</p>  <p>The hunt in Greenland appears to have been taking increasing numbers of Long-finned Pilot Whales in recent years (NAMMCO<em> </em>2018a). The Scientific Committee of NAMMCO (2014) noted that removals there exceeded sustainable levels given a 2007 abundance estimate. However, a 2015 abundance estimate for what is assumed to be the range of the hunted population was of similar magnitude to the 2007 estimate (NAMMCO 2016). </p>  <p>Long-finned Pilot Whales are subject to entanglement, hooking, and other forms of bycatch to varying degrees in a wide variety of fisheries across their range, although in most cases they are listed as one of the species affected in a particular fishery without any precise information on the number of animals taken (Reyes<em> </em>1991<em>,</em> Zerbini and Kotas<em> </em>1998<em>,</em> Leeney<em> et al. </em>2008<em>,</em> Culik<em> </em>2011<em>,</em> Verborgh<em> et al. </em>2016<em>,</em> Hayes<em> et al. </em>2017<em>,</em> Olson<em> </em>2018).</p>  <p>Pilot Whales, like beaked whales, are likely vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by military sonar and seismic surveys (Cox<em> et al. </em>2006<em>,</em> Parsons<em> et al. </em>2008<em>,</em> Sivle<em> et al. </em>2012<em>,</em> Parsons<em> </em>2017). High contaminant levels have been documented in several populations, including those in the Faroe Islands (Dam and Bloch<em> </em>2000<em>,</em> Nielsen<em> et al. </em>2000<em>,</em> Sonne<em> et al. </em>2010) and Tasmania (Weijs<em> et al. </em>2013), to the extent where their meat is considered a potential health hazard for human consumption if modest monthly recommended allowances are exceeded (Simmonds<em> et al. </em>1994).</p>  <p>Pilot Whales are among the species most often involved in mass strandings throughout their range, but it is not known whether human activity plays a role in these events (Hayes<em> et al. </em>2017). In some cases, disease, such as a morbillivirus epidemic in the Mediterranean, has been clearly implicated (FernÃ¡ndez<em> et al. </em>2008), but in other cases the cause(s) could not be attributed with certainty to any particular factor or set of factors (Bogomolni<em> et al. </em>2010<em>,</em> Dolman<em> et al. </em>2010). Predicted impacts of global climate change in the marine environment may affect Long-finned Pilot Whales, and may induce changes in the speciesâ range, prey distribution, abundance and/or migration patterns (Learmonth<em> et al. </em>2006<em>,</em> Simmonds and Eliott<em> </em>2009, Fielding 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>Sighting surveys in 1987 and 1989 generated an abundance estimate of more than 750,000 Long-finned Pilot Whales in the central and northeastern North Atlantic (Buckland<em> et al. </em>1993). The 2015 North Atlantic Sightings Survey (NASS), which included aerial and ship-board surveys, generated estimates of 589,681 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.38) for Iceland and the Faroe Islands, 258 (CV 1.02) for East Greenland, and 9,190 (CV 0.50) for West Greenland (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2018, NAMMCO 2018b). A recent analysis of Pilot Whale abundance estimates for the central and northeastern North Atlantic in the 28-year period from 1987 to 2015 found no detectable trend (Pike <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p>Sightings data from four surveys conducted from ships and airplanes during 2005-2007 in European waters (Small&#160;Cetaceans in the European&#160;Atlantic and&#160;North&#160;Sea (SCANS-II), Cetacean Offshore Distribution and Abundance in the European Atlantic (CODA), and Trans North Atlantic Sightings Survey (TNASS)) were used to estimate cetacean abundance using double-platform line transect methods. The model-based estimate of abundance in the eastern North Atlantic from the four surveys combined was 152,071 (CV 0.32) Long-finned Pilot Whales (Rogan<em> et al. </em>2017).</p><p>The Canadian component of TNASS conducted in JulyâAugust 2007 generated an abundance estimate of 16,058 (CV 0.79) Long-finned Pilot Whales in Canadian Atlantic waters, although it should be noted that this estimate is likely negatively biased as it was not corrected for availability (Lawson and Gosselin<em> </em>2011). The best estimate of Long-finned Pilot Whales in the portion of the western North Atlantic between central Virginia and the lower Bay of Fundy, based on a 2011 line transect survey, is 5,636 (CV 0.63) (Palka<em> </em>2012). This was the first line transect survey in that area that was able to reliably distinguish between Long-finned and Short-finned Pilot Whales in those parts of the area where their distribution overlaps, using differences in pigmentation visible in photographs (Rone and Pace<em> </em>2012), but it should be noted that this survey excluded areas of known occurrence of Pilot Whales further to the north (Hayes 2017).&#160;&#160;</p><p>Although no complete abundance estimate is available for the Mediterranean basin, at least two resident populations have been well documented, with apparently no exchange between them â one in and around the Strait of Gibraltar with a mean estimate of 213 individuals (95% confidence interval 142â352) between 1999 and 2005 (Verborgh<em> et al. </em>2009), and another in the AlborÃ¡n Sea and the Gulf of Vera, where 1,569 individual Pilot Whales were photo-identified between 1992 and 2009&#160;(Morata <em>et al</em>. 2013 in Verborgh<em> et al. </em>2016). Encounters with Long-finned Pilot Whales (1.042/km) were highest in the AlborÃ¡n Sea (CaÃ±adas and Sagarminaga<em> </em>2000). Survival rates calculated for both populations indicate that the Strait of Gibraltar population was more severely affected by a morbillivirus outbreak in 2006-2007 (FernÃ¡ndez<em> et al. </em>2008) than the AlborÃ¡n Sea population (Wierucka<em> et al. </em>2014).</p><p>Sighting surveys conducted between 1976 and 1978 yielded an estimate of roughly 200,000 Long-finned Pilot Whales in the Antarctic in the summer (Kasamatsu and Joyce<em> </em>1995). Although mass strandings of Pilot Whales regularly occur off the coasts of New Zealand and Australia (Oremus<em> et al. </em>2009<em>,&#160;</em>2013), no current information is available on population status from these countries or other areas in the Southern Hemisphere.</p><p>          </p><p>There is no information on trends in abundance of the species as a whole (Hayes<em> et al. </em>2017<em>,</em> Olson<em> </em>2018). Genetic studies indicate weak population structure in the North Atlantic, associated with sea-surface temperature, while in the Southern Hemisphere stronger than expected differences were found between populations sampled off New Zealand and Tasmania (Oremus<em> et al. </em>2009).</p>      <p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Long-finned Pilot Whales have an anti-tropical distribution in temperate and subpolar zones of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (Olson<em> </em>2018). In the Northern Hemisphere, this species is found only in the North Atlantic Ocean, including the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Abend and Smith<em> </em>1999). Long-finned Pilot Whales are not found in the North Pacific Ocean. Skeletal evidence suggests that they were previously present in the western North Pacific but they appear to be absent there today (Olson<em> </em>2018). The subpopulation(s) in the Southern Hemisphere occur as far south as the Antarctic Convergence, sometimes to at least 65Â°S and extending north only to approximately 30Â°S (Kasamatsu and Joyce<em> </em>1995<em>,</em> Bernard and Reilly<em> </em>1999). The Northern and Southern Hemisphere populations of Long-finned Pilot Whales are geographically disjunct, and the two populations are apparently isolated although genetic evidence indicates a low degree of shared mitochondrial DNA haplotypes (Oremus<em> et al. </em>2009). </p><p>  </p><p>In some areas, including the east coast of the United States, the east coast of Australia, and both coasts of South America and Africa, the distribution overlaps that of the Short-finned Pilot Whale (Olson<em> </em>2018). This has presented a challenge to abundance and conservation status assessments because the two species are difficult to distinguish at sea (Olson<em> </em>2018). However, recent analyses used both morphological and genetic evidence to distinguish between the two species in waters off the east coast of the United States. These analyses indicated that Long-finned Pilot Whales were primarily found in sea surface temperatures &lt;22Â°C and were uncommon in temperatures &gt;25Â°C (Garrison and Rosel<em> </em>2017).</p><p></p>",The&#160;Long-finned Pilot Whale is harvested&#160;for food in the Faroe Islands and Greenland and those harvests are thought to be sustainable.,Marine,The Long-finned Pilot Whale is listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix II and also on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).,Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50356660,9461,Grampus griseus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-02-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Rissoâs Dolphin is a widely distributed species that occurs throughout tropical and temperate waters in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. These dolphins appear to favour continental slope habitat but also occur at lower densities in oceanic and continental shelf waters. The sum of existing abundance estimates is about 350,000 individuals, but as these estimates are from only a small fraction of the total distribution range of the species, actual abundance is likely much higher. Threats that may be causing declines include bycatch in offshore gillnets, pelagic longlines, and other fishing gear. There is little quantitative information on bycatch rates, but it is clear that this species is taken in small or moderate numbers in several countries throughout its range. However, given its wide distribution and considerable abundance, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout the speciesâ extensive range, the Rissoâs Dolphin is assessed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern. There is not enough information to rule out the possibility that the global population has declined by 30% or more over three generations (60 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) and if that were the case it would qualify for listing as Vulnerable. Therefore, further monitoring is encouraged and this assessment should be regarded as provisional, pending better information particularly regarding incidental mortality in fisheries.","<p>Rissoâs Dolphins inhabit deep oceanic and continental slope waters, generally 400-1,000 m deep (Baumgartner 1997, Hartman 2017, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, 2014). They frequent sub-surface seamounts and escarpments, where they are thought to feed on vertically migrant and mesopelagic cephalopods. In Monterey Bay, California, Risso's Dolphins are concentrated over areas with steep bottom topography (Kruse 1989). Currents and upwelling causing local increases in marine productivity may enhance feeding opportunities, resulting in the patchy distribution and local abundance of this species worldwide (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). Davis <em>et al</em>. (1998) and Baumgartner (1997) reported that in the Gulf of Mexico, Risso's Dolphins were mostly found along the upper continental slope, which may reflect mesopelagic squid distribution. Most records of Rissoâs Dolphins&#160;in Britain and Ireland are within 11 km of the coast. They are known to occur during summer in shallow (occasionally &lt;10m in depth) coastal waters where they feed on Common Cuttlefish (<em>Sepia officinalis)</em> along the French coast of the English Channel (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Long-term changes in the occurrence of Rissoâs Dolphins in some areas (e.g., off Catalina Island and in central California) have been linked to ocean conditions and movements of spawning squid (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). Risso's Dolphins mostly feed on mesopelagic and benthic cephalopods, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus (Cockroft <em>et al. </em>1993). In the few areas where feeding habits have been studied, they appear to feed mainly at night (Spitz <em>et al. </em>2011, Wang <em>et al. </em>2012). Rissoâs Dolphins likely take advantage of the circadian vertical movements of their prey, particularly mesopelagic squid (Soldevilla <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>","<p>In Sri Lanka, Risso's Dolphins were, at least during the 1980s, the third most commonly taken cetacean in fisheries, providing meat for human consumption and fish bait (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Leatherwood 1994). Around 15% of the estimated 9,000 cetaceans landed annually in Sri Lanka between 1984-1986 were Rissoâs Dolphins, most of them having been caught in gillnets or harpooned (Leatherwood 1994). In Japan, Risso's Dolphins are taken regularly by hand harpoon and driving, in set nets, and as a limited catch in the small-type whaling industry, with reported catches in recent years ranging from about 250â500 (Kasuya 2018). In 2007/2008, 246 Rissoâs Dolphins were reported to have been taken by the harpoon fishery operating off Hokkaido, Sanriku, Boso, and Kii (Kazuya 2018). They are also a major target of artisanal hunting and are taken incidentally in gillnets and other fishing gear in the Philippines and China (Dolar 1994, Dolar <em>et al</em>. 1994, Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). Off eastern Taiwan, Rissoâs Dolphins are taken opportunistically by harpoon and they are caught incidentally in large-mesh driftnets for large pelagic fish (Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 2012, several groups of Rissoâs Dolphins were intentionally killed in the Faroe Islands (Bloch <em>et al. </em>2012) where Long-finned Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala melas</em>) and Atlantic White-sided Dolphins (<em>Lagenorhynchus acutus</em>) are the primary targets of the drive hunt for cetaceans.<br/><br/>Bycatch occasionally occurs in pelagic longline fisheries in the southwestern Indian Ocean and along the U.S. Atlantic coast, particularly since Rissoâs Dolphins regularly depredate squid used as bait (Garrison 2007, Kiszka 2015). Between 2011 and 2012, several Rissoâs Dolphin deaths were recorded in the pelagic longline fishery based in La Reunion (Sabarros <em>et al. </em>2013). In Tanzania, bycatch has been recorded in drift gillnet fisheries targeting tuna, billfish, sharks, and other large pelagic fish off Zanzibar and Pemba (J. Kiszka, unpublished data). Bycatch in gillnets has also been documented in Ghana, the Azores, Peru, and the Solomon Islands (Bearzi <em>et al. </em>2011, Debrah <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reeves <em>et al. </em>2013). Bycatch rates of Rissoâs Dolphins in the Swordfish and Thresher Shark gillnet fishery off California are considered relatively low based on observer data (Carretta and Enriquez 2012).<br/><br/>Like beaked whales (Ziphiidae), which are also deep-divers that prey on cephalopods, Rissoâs Dolphins are likely susceptible to disturbance by loud anthropogenic sound, such as that generated by military sonar and seismic surveys (Cox <em>et al. </em>2006, Modest 2015, Southall <em>et al</em>. 2016). They are also exposed to disturbance by whale-watching boats (Visser <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Rissoâs Dolphins in the Mediterranean carry substantial contaminant burdens (Kim <em>et al</em>. 1996, Marsili and Focardi 1997).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of global abundance for Rissoâs Dolphins, but there are estimates for some specific areas. Surveys off California in 1991 and 1992 found estimated abundance to be almost an order of magnitude higher in winter (N=32,376, coefficient of variation (CV)=46%) than in summer (N=3,980, CV=57%) (Forney and Barlow 1998). The current stock assessment for this species along the Pacific coast of the U.S. was calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys to give an abundance estimate of 6,336 (CV=32%) animals (Barlow 2016). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 7,256 (CV=41%) (Bradford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Based on surveys conducted from 1986 to 1990, 175,800 (CV=38%) Rissoâs Dolphins were estimated in the eastern tropical Pacific (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). The best abundance estimate for Rissoâs Dolphins in U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic is 18,250 (CV=46%) based on surveys in 2011 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2016), with an additional 1,589 (CV=27%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico based on surveys in 2003 and 2004 (Waring <em>et al. </em>2009). Aerial surveys on the European continental shelf in summer 2016 (SCANS-III) generated an estimate of 11,069 Rissoâs Dolphins (CV=51%), with highest densities off eastern Ireland and northwestern Scotland (Hammond <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>In the northern Indian Ocean, Ballance and Pitman (1998) recorded Rissoâs Dolphin as the fourth most abundant cetacean species, in Tanzania in the western Indian Ocean it was the second most frequently encountered species after the Spinner Dolphin (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>) (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is one of the most common species in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). Estimates based on indices of relative abundance of Rissoâs Dolphins off Sri Lanka from 1980 to 1984 ranged from 5,500 to 13,000 animals (Kruse <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1991). Recent surveys suggest a possible decline of Rissoâs Dolphins off Sri Lanka, particularly along the south coast (Anderson 2013). In the eastern Sulu Sea in 1994-1995, Dolar <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. (2006) estimated abundance at 1,514 (CV=55%). There were estimated to be 83,300 (CV=17%) Rissoâs Dolphins in three areas of concentrated occurrence off Japan between 1983 and 1991 (Miyashita 1993). Extensive aerial surveys conducted in the southwestern Indian Ocean in 2009 and 2010 produced abundance estimates for the Seychelles (17,115 individuals, CV=28%), the Mascarene islands (554, CV=86%), and the northern (298, CV=74%), central (3,107, CV=33%), and southern (3,141, CV=33%) Mozambique Channel (Laran <em>et al. </em>2017). The sum of the above abundance estimates is around 350,000, however, as these surveys covered only a small proportion of the total range of the species, total range-wide abundance is likely to be substantially higher.<br/><br/>There is no information on global trends in abundance. However, decreases may have occurred in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009) and along the west coast of the U.S. (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2009). In the late 1950s, Risso's Dolphins were rarely encountered in the Southern California Bight, and between 1975 and 1978 they were still considered to be a minor part of the cetacean fauna, representing only 3% of the cetaceans observed (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). After the El NiÃ±o event of 1982/83, however, numbers of Risso's Dolphins increased, especially around Santa Catalina Island where they came to be considered common (Shane 1995). In Sri Lanka, tuna drift gillnet fisheries may have caused a dramatic decline of Rissoâs Dolphins (Kruse <em>et al.</em> 1991). The species is currently very rare there, while it was reported as abundant in the 1980s (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Anderson 2013).</p>",Unknown,"The Rissoâs Dolphin&#160;is a widely distributed species that primarily inhabits waters of the continental slope and outer shelf (especially areas with steep bottom topography) in the tropics and temperate regions of both hemispheres (Baumgartner 1997, Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999, Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014). It also occurs in oceanic areas (beyond the 2,000 m depth contour) such as in the eastern tropical Pacific, in the northeastern Atlantic (Hammond <em>et al. </em>2017), in the western Indian Ocean and in the northwestern Pacific (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014). In the north of its range, Rissoâs Dolphins have also been recorded from Newfoundland, Norway, the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Gulf of Alaska. In the south, they have been recorded off the tip of South Africa, southern Australia, the North Island of New Zealand and to 40-50Â°S off both coasts of South America (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Their range includes many semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of California, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Sea of Japan, and Mediterranean Sea. In a number of regions, Rissoâs Dolphins can be encountered in the shallow waters of the continental shelf, such as in the English Channel (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2004, 2007) and the Celtic Sea (Reid <em>et al. </em>2003).

Clarifying language in the Red List Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2019) states that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.â Although there is considerable uncertainty about numbers and trends, the global population numbers at least around 20,000. Therefore, the category of Critically Endangered is not plausible and the species should not be assigned to the DD category.<br/><br/>Northern Bottlenose Whales are much more visible than most other beaked whales, and they are fairly commonly observed in some parts of their range (Whitehead and Hooker 2012). The population was seriously depleted by commercial whaling and likely remains well below historical (pre-whaling) levels. However, the main decline of the total population of this species took place more than three generations ago (46.5 or 53.4 years, with a generation length of 15.5 [COSEWIC 2011] or 17.8 years [Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007]), although the declines in some specific areas such as Labrador (where whaling ended in 1971) occurred much more recently (late 1960s-early 1970s). Total population size is probably in the low tens of thousands although survey coverage of the range is far from complete, and there are potentially significant and largely unresolved biases (both positive and negative) in converting survey data into population estimates (Whitehead and Hooker 2012).<br/><br/>Current and projected threats that could cause declines include high levels of anthropogenic sound, especially from military mid-frequency sonar and seismic surveys, and bycatch in fisheries. The pervasiveness and severity of these threats varies across the range. Listing as Near Threatened is plausible given the historical depletion in combination with ongoing exposure to underwater sound and the risk of bycatch in parts of the speciesâ range. Although the speciesâ widespread occurrence and the relatively large total number of individuals across the range mean that Least Concern is also plausible, the history of depletion, the uncertainty surrounding abundance estimates, and the evidence that these whales are exposed in much of their range to harmful anthropogenic sound and bycatch risk, taken together, argue for a precautionary approach and a listing as Near Threatened. Near Threatened is selected               because the               species is close to meeting criterion C1               for Vulnerable, as there may be fewer than 10,000 mature               individuals and, given the threats from               bycatch, plastics and anthropogenic noise, a continuing               decline of 10% over               three generations is plausible.<br/><br/>Two âdesignatable unitsâ are listed under Canadaâs Species At Risk Act - the Scotian Shelf population as Endangered and the Davis Strait-Baffin Bay-Labrador Sea population as Special Concern (COSEWIC 2011). The Scotian Shelf population (often referred to as The Gully population) may warrant a separate subpopulation assessment for the Red List, as may other subpopulations of the species as population structure becomes better known.</p>","<p>These cold temperate to subarctic whales are found in deep waters (generally at least 500 m deep), mostly seaward of the continental shelf and often near submarine canyons. They sometimes travel several kilometers into broken ice fields, but are more common in open water. Few whales were caught in shallow waters over the continental shelf off Labrador and in waters less than 1,000 m deep off the west coast of Norway.</p><p>The species occupies a very narrow niche: its primary food source is squid of the genus <em>Gonatus</em> (Hooker <em>et al</em>. 2001, Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 2003). The whales may also occasionally eat fish (such as herring and redfish), sea cucumbers, starfish, and prawns. They do much of their feeding on or near the bottom in very deep water (&gt;800 m, and as deep as 1,400 m; Hooker and Baird 1999). FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported that the stomachs of three individuals had remains of warm-temperate cephalopods (e.g. <em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>, <em>Heteroteuthis</em> sp.).</p>","<p>This is one of only two species of beaked whales that were hunted commercially on a large scale. Somewhat more than 800 Northern Bottlenose Whales were reportedly taken in the Faroe Islands during the period 1584â1993 (Bloch <em>et al</em>. 1996). Hunting by whalers from Great Britain, Norway, and Canada from the 1850s to the early 1970s resulted in more than 65,000 whales landed (with many more struck but lost; Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1993). Mitchell (1977) considered that the population was severely depleted by whaling in both the early (steam-powered) and modern (petroleum-powered) whaling periods. The species has essentially been unexploited for almost 50 years (i.e. since the Norwegian pelagic hunt ended in 1973), with only a few animals taken in some years in the Faroe Islands (on average 2.2 whales per year reported in the period 1709â2002). The aggregate population was certainly reduced by whaling, and the extent of recovery is uncertain (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Recovery rate and general resilience to threats is affected by this speciesâ slow reproductive rate (Feyrer <em>et al.</em> 2020). A significant decline in genetic diversity has been detected in the Scotian Shelf population which corresponds to the timing of whaling (Feyrer <em>et al.</em> 2019). Low genetic diversity and inbreeding may be having an impact on the recovery of this very small, genetically distinct unit.</p>  <p>Northern Bottlenose Whales reportedly interact with trawl and longline fisheries in a number of areasâoff Iceland (VÃ­kingsson <em>et al</em>. 2009), on the Scotian Shelf, and off Newfoundland (Oyarbide Cuervas-Mons 2008, Marotte 2017). They interact with fisheries for Greenland halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>) in Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea (COSEWIC 2011). Small numbers of entanglements have been reported, but reporting is far from complete (Whitehead and Hooker 2012). Given the very low observer effort and the low likelihood that fatally entangled whales would wash ashore or otherwise be seen or reported, any records are a concern. Unpublished data (L. J. Feyrer, unpubl. data) from the Scotian Shelf photo-identification catalogue indicated that 4â5% of the identified individuals bear entanglement or propeller scars. Entanglement in fisheries may be an important source of mortality for this species.<br/><br/>Miller <em>et al</em>. (2015) considered Northern Bottlenose Whales to be highly sensitive to acoustic disturbance and therefore at risk from marine industrialization and naval activity (mid-frequency sonar). In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic surveys, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bernaldo de QuirÃ³s <em>et al</em>. 2019). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bernaldo de QuirÃ³s <em>et al</em>. 2019). Off the U.S. west coast anthropogenic noise has been implicated in declines in mesoplodonts (Moore and Barlow 2013). The effects of seismic surveys has been a particular concern for Northern Bottlenose Whales (DFO 2009) and, partially to protect the Northern Bottlenose Whale, the Gully was declared a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2004 and no such activities are permitted inside its boundary (although seismic surveys outside the MPA boundary would certainly ensonify waters within that boundary). The habitat of Northern Bottlenose Whales off the eastern and northeastern edges of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has been exposed to a particularly high density of seismic surveys (Gomez <em>et al</em>. 2017, Marotte 2017). Grove&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2020) reported a series of sightings and strandings of these whales along the northern coast of Iceland between July and October 2018, a year in which around 100 beaked whales were documented as having died across the Northeast Atlantic. Those authors also noted the temporal coincidence between the first sightings of Northern Bottlenose Whales in SkjÃ¡lfandi Bay (Iceland) and the start of a NATO&#160;anti-submarine&#160;warfare exercise in the Norwegian Sea (immediately east of Iceland).<br/><br/>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of cetacean mortality, especially of beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm: Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other ziphiids (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and they represent a potential hazard to the health of Bottlenose Whales. Overall levels in Northern Bottlenose Whales in the western Atlantic were comparable to those reported for other North Atlantic odontocetes (Hooker <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; However, contaminant levels in The Gully population of Bottlenose Whales increased dramatically between 1996 and 2003; although the source of this increase is unknown, it may have been related to the onset of drilling for gas nearby (Hooker <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>An overall decline in available habitat for Northern Bottlenose Whales was predicted by MacLeod (2009) as a result of warmer waters due to global climate change (also see Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>","<p>Abundance of the Scotian Shelf population was estimated at 143 (95% confidence interval 129â156) and approximately stable between 1988-2011 using photo-identification mark-recapture methods (OâBrien and Whitehead 2013). New analyses adding data up until 2019 suggest a slight decline in abundance between 1988 and roughly 2004 (when The Gully was made a Marine Protected Area) with a slight increase thereafter (L.J. Feyrer and H. Whitehead, Dalhousie University, unpubl. data). A minimum estimate of abundance on the northeastern edge of the Grand Banks was 128, based upon a lack of photo identification matches between surveys in 2016 and 2017 (Stewart 2018). There are no published abundance estimates for other areas of the western North Atlantic. Over 65,000 Northern Bottlenose Whales were killed in a multinational hunt that operated in the North Atlantic from <em>ca</em> 1850 to the early 1970s (Mitchell 1977, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1993). Christensen and Ugland (1983) estimated the initial (pre-whaling) population size as about 90,000 whales, reduced to some 30,000 by 1914. In 1995, the Scientific Committee of the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) modelled population trajectories for the northeastern Atlantic, using recorded catch data, assumptions about the population biology of the species, and recent population estimates. The results were highly varied, suggesting an initial population of between about 35,000 and 110,000, and population status in the 1990s was inferred to have ranged from fully recovered to still severely depleted (NAMMCO 1995).<br/><br/>It is challenging to estimate abundance for populations of Northern Bottlenose Whales, except where a substantial proportion of the population has been photo-identified (currently true only for the Scotian Shelf). Due to their deep dives, they are rarely sighted during aerial surveys (e.g. Lawson and Gosselin 2009). Their deep and prolonged diving also adds a substantial negative bias to shipboard visual surveys, but one that can be corrected for. However, Bottlenose Whales are also well known for approaching ships, a tendency that introduces a positive bias in abundance estimates from shipboard surveys that is much harder to correct for (Whitehead and Hooker 2012).<br/><br/>There is no estimate of current global abundance. A very rough and outdated estimate for the entire eastern North Atlantic is 40,000 (NAMMCO&#160; 1995). The Iceland (and Faroes) population was estimated at 28,000 (CV = 0.22) from shipboard surveys in 1995 and 2001 (Pike <em>et al.</em> 2003). The population in the waters off the Faeroes and Western Europe was estimated at 19,539 (CV = 0.36) based upon 15 sightings from ships in 2005 and 2007 (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2017). Thirty-six ship-based sightings off Iceland and the Faroes in 2015 resulted in an estimate of 18,375 (CV = 0.59) (NAMMCO 2019). There are no statistically valid abundance estimates for the Andenes, MÃ¸re, and Svalbard areas. Therefore, the current North Atlantic population is likely on the order of at least 20,000 whales.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Northern Bottlenose Whales are found only in the deep waters (usually &gt;500 m deep) of the North Atlantic. In the west, they occur from New England, USA to Davis Strait and southern Baffin Bay, between Baffin Island and Greenland; in the east, from the Strait of Gibraltar to Svalbard (<em>ca</em>. 38ÂºN to 72ÂºN: Mead 1989, Moors-Murphy 2018). Their northern pelagic distribution extends to the margins of pack ice. The Gully on the Scotian Shelf southeast of Nova Scotia, Canada (<em>ca</em>. 44ÂºN, 59ÂºW) is the southernmost area of consistent Northern Bottlenose Whale presence in the western Atlantic (Wimmer and Whitehead 2004). In the eastern North Atlantic, the southernmost area of consistent presence is around the Azores (<em>ca</em>. 39Â°N: Steiner <em>et al</em>. 1998, Weilermann <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, the southern limits of their known range are Virginia (<em>ca</em>. 36Â°N), USA, in the west (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015), and the Canary Islands in the east (29ÂºN, Vonk and Martin-Martel 1989). Though there are a few reports from the Mediterranean Sea (CaÃ±adas and Sagarminaga 2000), the North Sea (Mead 1989) and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Mitchell and Kozicki 1975), these whales are not seen regularly in enclosed seas (Moors-Murphy 2018).</p>  <p>Historical catch statistics were interpreted as indicating at least six centers of abundance, each potentially representing a separate stock (Benjaminsen 1972, Whitehead and Hooker 2012): i) The Gully, ii) northern Labrador Sea-Davis Strait; (iii) East Greenland, Iceland, Jan Mayen and Faeroe Islands; iv) Andenes, Norway; v) MÃ¸re, Norway; and vi) Svalbard. Anecdotal reports from whalers suggest a north-south seasonal migration in some regions of the eastern Atlantic but there is no solid evidence for this. Bottlenose Whales are present in The Gully year-round (Whitehead and Hooker 2012). They inhabit the most northerly waters of the Barents and Greenland seas in summer (May to August) and are present in Baffin Bay in at least the summer and autumn.</p>  <p>The best-known population is centred in several large submarine canyons, most notably The Gully, on the edge of the Scotian Shelf southeast of Nova Scotia, Canada (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1993, Wimmer and Whitehead 2004, COSEWIC 2011). This population is largely isolated from others to the north (Newfoundland, Labrador) and northeast (northern Iceland) as shown by genomic and photoidentification data (Feyrer <em>et al</em>. 2019; Stewart 2018).</p>","<p>This species was heavily exploited in the past for multiple purposes, but there is now only a very small-scale hunt in the Faroes.</p>",Marine,"<p>The species is included in Appendix I of CITES.

Several Southern Bottlenose Whales have been recorded as bycatch of large-scale driftnet fishing in the Tasman Sea, but numbers taken annually are not known (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Although past levels of bycatch are unknown, they are likely to be low now due to adoption in 1989 of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly, which called for effective conservation and management measures of living marine resources in areas of high seas drift-netting.

50358334,11047,Kogia breviceps,Least Concern,,2020,2019-10-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Pygmy Sperm Whale is distributed in deep oceanic waters of the tropical and temperate Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from approximately 50Â°S to 50-60Â°N. Despite the expansion of cetacean research in oceanic waters, there is still very limited information on the distribution, abundance, behaviour or population structure of Pygmy Sperm Whales globally. This is largely due to the short surfacing interval, cryptic surface behavior and long, deep dives which make these whales extremely challenging to observe at sea. There is no information on global abundance or trends but numerous stranding records and high detection rates during acoustic surveys indicate that this species is not as uncommon as visual surveys would suggest. Unlike some beaked whales, Pygmy Sperm Whales do not seem to experience significant impacts from exposure to anthropogenic noise, and they also do not appear to be bycaught frequently in fishing gear. However, because they are so rarely observed, declines would be difficult to detect and therefore a 30% global reduction over three generations (36 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out.&#160; </p>  <p>The Pygmy Sperm Whale was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008 and it remains extremely data-poor. The Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) state that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DDâ. In this instance the number of sightings and strandings and the wide pan-tropical distribution preclude the species being classified as Critically Endangered and DD therefore cannot be applied. The Pygmy Sperm Whale is therefore classified as Least Concern on the assumption that it is widely distributed and there are areas of known concentration, no major threats are known to occur across the majority of its range and it is likely to be more common than would be suggested from sighting surveys (due to its cryptic behavior).</p>","<p>At-sea observations of Pygmy Sperm Whales are rare, and therefore their habitat preferences remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is established that they occur over continental and insular slope waters, as well as in deep oceanic waters. Off the main Hawaiian Islands, small-boat dedicated surveys conducted from 2000 to 2012 showed that Pygmy Sperm Whales occur mostly in waters deeper than 2000 m (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2013). Elsewhere, sightings are often aggregated with those of Dwarf Sperm Whales, which makes a detailed assessment of their habitat preferences challenging (e.g. Mullin <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Gulf of Mexico, Baumgartner <em>et al</em>. (2001) recorded sightings most frequently in water depths between 400 and 1,000 m, with some sightings extending into much deeper waters (up to 3,500 m). </p>  <p>A number of studies have described the diet and feeding ecology of Pygmy Sperm Whales around the globe. Their diet consists primarily of oceanic cephalopods, but includes fish, shrimp and swimming crabs (Ross 1979, Beatson 2007, Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Small mesopelagic squid (particularly Histiothidae and Cranchiidae) contribute significantly to the diet of Pygmy Sperm Whales (Beatson 2007, Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Cephalopods are the primary prey of Pygmy Sperm Whales in Hawaiian waters judging by the fact that they comprised 78.7% of prey abundance and 93.4% of the biomass in stomachs of stranded specimens, with 38 species from 17 different families represented (West <em>et al</em>. 2009). Morphological adaptations such as their âfalse gillsâ and ability to squirt ink suggest that the evolution of <em>Kogia</em> spp. was shaped in part by high predation pressure, particularly from sharks and killer whales (PlÃ¶n 2004). </p>","<p>Small numbers of Pygmy Sperm Whales have been taken in coastal whaling operations off Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Lesser Antilles, and Sri Lanka (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, the extent of takes is extremely small. They have also been caught incidentally in drift gillnet fisheries in Sri Lanka, Thailand, California and in the north-east Atlantic (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>1993, Barlow <em>et al. </em>1997, Perez <em>et al. </em>2001). In 2005, a large series of unusual stranding events over about 3 weeks in and around Taiwan included several <em>Kogia</em>&#160;(Wang and Yang 2006, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008), with at least two of them Pygmy Sperm Whales (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is unknown if military, seismic or other loud noise-producing human activities were implicated in these strandings. Pygmy sperm whales are known to have died from plastic ingestion (Tarpley &amp; Marwitz 1993). The neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) was detected in urine and fecal samples recovered from 24 of 41 Pygmy Sperm Whales stranded along the U.S. Atlantic coast from 1997 to 2008, suggesting that exposure to these toxins from harmful algal blooms should be a concern (Fire <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of global Pygmy Sperm Whale abundance. Estimates of local or regional abundance are few, particularly because of the cryptic nature of this species as well as the difficulty of distinguishing <em>K. breviceps</em> from <em>K. sima </em>at sea. Abundance estimation is challenging because these whales dive for long periods and are inconspicuous when they surface. Therefore, visual surveys have a very low probability of detection (at or well below approximately 35%) (Barlow 1999; Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p>  <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, the most recent abundance estimates for Pygmy and Dwarf Sperm Whales combined is 186 (CV=1.04) from a summer survey conducted in 2009 and covering the waters from the 200m isobath to the seaward extent of the US EEZ (Garrison 2016). Earlier estimates in the Gulf of Mexico that again combined both <em>Kogia</em> species were from 1991-1994 (547, CV=0.28), 1996-2001 (742, CV=0.29) and 2003-2004 (453, CV=1.04) generated from surveys all conducted between April and August (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Mullin 2007). In the western North Atlantic, the best abundance estimate is 3,785 individuals (CV=0.47) from a summer survey conducted in 2011 from the waters of central Florida to the lower Bay of Fundy (Palka 2012, Garrison 2016). The two&#160;<em>Kogia</em>&#160;species strand frequently on beaches of the southeastern United States. For example, between 1978 and 1987, Odell (1991) documented that <em>Kogia</em> spp. was the second most frequently stranded cetacean taxon, after the common bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>), from North Carolina to Texas. From 2007â2015, 17 strandings of <em>Kogia</em> spp. were documented in Virginia, 81 in North Carolina, and 112 on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). The large number of strandings in these states suggests that <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. are a common component of the US Atlantic cetacean fauna, despite the fact that these species are seldom detected during visual surveys in these waters (Garrison <em>et al</em>. 2010). This was confirmed by a recent study that compared the detections of <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. between visual survey and passive acoustic methods along the U.S. Atlantic coast, concluding that <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. are indeed relatively common in shelf break and slope waters of the western North Atlantic between Virginia and Florida, and that they are not readily available to visual surveys in this region (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>The latest abundance estimate from the Hawaiian EEZ is 7,138 (CV=1.12) from a 2002 shipboard survey (Barlow 2006). A 2010 survey throughout the Hawaiian EEZ did not result in any <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. sightings (Bradford <em>et al. </em>2013). In Hawaiian waters, the Pygmy Sperm Whale is the second most frequently recorded stranded cetacean species, with 35 strandings documented between 1963 and 2008 (Shallenberger 1981, Nitta 1987, Maldini<em> et al</em>. 2005) again suggesting they are relatively common but rarely sighted in the region. Off the west coast of the US (Washington, Oregon and California), the best estimate of Pygmy Sperm Whale abundance is 4,111 (CV=1.12) based on shipboard line-transect surveys in 2008 and 2014 (Barlow 2016). In the southwestern Indian Ocean, aerial survey data resulted in an abundance of 683 (both species of <em>Kogia</em> aggregated) in the Mozambique Channel, the Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands (Laran <em>et al</em>. 2017). Florida (USA) and South Africa have the highest reported stranding rates of these species in the world, which suggests that <em>Kogia </em>spp. are relatively abundant in these regions (Credle 1988, PlÃ¶n 2004).</p>  <p>Population genetic analyses conducted on southern hemisphere samples revealed a high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, but a lack of phylogeographic structure which indicates a high degree of gene flow among populations (PlÃ¶n 2004).</p>  <p>The sum of the existing abundance estimates from various regions is over 10,000 individuals but surveys have covered only a small fraction of the entire habitat of the species and abundance estimates. Also, the estimates are often imprecise and negatively biased. Total global abundance is likely much higher than 10,000.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Pygmy Sperm Whales occur in deep oceanic waters of the temperate and tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from approximately 50Â°S to 50-60Â°N. The southern distribution includes New Zealand, Tasmania and South Africa, and the northern distributional limits extend to Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. They are mostly observed over shelf breaks and in insular slope waters (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2015, McAlpine 2018). Pygmy Sperm Whales are rarely recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea or shallower waters of SE Asia (McAlpine 2018, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). The range of <em>Kogia breviceps</em> is still poorly understood, though a lack of live sighting records may be due more to their inconspicuous behaviour than to rarity. Stranding records suggest that the species is locally common in some areas such as off South Africa or the southeastern USA (PlÃ¶n 2004, Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Pygmy Sperm Whale has not been recorded in West Africa, but this may be due to the lack of surveys in that region (Weir 2010).</p>","<p>Pygmy Sperm Whales are hunted on a small scale in a few places (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>1993, 2015).</p>",Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

50359330,11048,Kogia sima,Least Concern,,2020,2020-02-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Dwarf Sperm Whale is an oceanic species that occurs in the tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Although these whales are frequently encountered in several regions, including Hawaii and the Bahamas, there is limited information on their numbers, population structure and ecology. This can be attributed to their cryptic nature which makes them extremely challenging to observe and study. There is no information on global abundance or trends, but numerous stranding records and high detection rates during acoustic surveys in some areas indicate that Dwarf Sperm Whales are not as uncommon as visual surveys would suggest. Because they are so rarely observed and identified, declines would be difficult to detect.</p>  <p>The Dwarf Sperm Whale was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008 and it remains data-poor. The Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) state that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DDâ. In this instance the number of sightings and strandings and the wide pan-tropical distribution precludes the species being classified as Critically Endangered and rules out a DD classification on the basis of that âcriterionâ. The Dwarf Sperm Whale is classified as Least Concern on the understanding that it is widely distributed, while there are no areas of known concentration, no major threats are known to occur across the majority of its range, and it is likely to be more common than is suggested from the results of sighting surveys (due to its cryptic behaviour).</p>","<p></p><p>Dwarf Sperm Whales occur over continental and insular slope waters, as well as in deep oceanic waters. Off the main Hawaiian Islands, the Dwarf Sperm Whale is the sixth most commonly observed species and it is most frequently sighted in waters 500-1,000m deep (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2013). Around Great Abaco in the Bahamas, Dwarf Sperm Whales are common in slope and deep oceanic waters, with some seasonal movement between the two (Dunphy-Daly <em>et al</em>. 2008). Elsewhere, sightings of Dwarf Sperm Whales are often combined with those of Pygmy Sperm Whales, which makes a detailed assessment of their respective habitat preferences challenging (Mullin <em>et al</em>. 2004). Relatively few studies have described the diet of Dwarf Sperm Whales. However, the available information suggests that they are primarily teuthophagous. Along the US Atlantic coast, Dwarf Sperm Whales primarily consume small squids of the families Histioteuthidae, Cranchiidae and Ommastrephidae (mean mantle length = 7.8 cm; Staudinger <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the SW Atlantic Ocean, stomach content data from Brazil suggest that at least 10 families of cephalopods are consumed (Dos Santos and Haimovici 2001, Moura <em>et al</em>. 2016). &#160;About 38 different prey species are known from South Africa (Ross 1979; PlÃ¶n 2004).</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>Small numbers of Dwarf Sperm Whales have been taken deliberately in opportunistic hunting off Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Lesser Antilles, and Sri Lanka (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, the scale of such removals is thought to be very small. These whales also die incidentally in drift gillnet fisheries in the northern Indian Ocean and in pelagic longline fisheries in the north-eastern Atlantic (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>1993, Arbelo <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). In 2005, a large series of unusual stranding events over a period of about 3 weeks in and around Taiwan included 13 Dwarf Sperm Whales (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is unknown if military, seismic survey or other loud noise-producing human activities were implicated in these strandings. Exposure to domoic acid associated with harmful algal blooms was implicated in Dwarf Sperm Whale mortality in the south-eastern US (Fire <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; As with most other cetaceans, there is growing evidence that Kogia species have a propensity to swallow plastic debris (Stamper <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160; </p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>There is limited information on the abundance of Dwarf Sperm Whales. Estimates of local or regional abundance are few, particularly because of the cryptic nature of this species as well as the difficulty of distinguishing <em>K. breviceps</em> from <em>K. sima </em>at sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, minimal (uncorrected) abundance estimates generated from vessel-based surveys conducted between April and August refer to both species, combined. Estimates include 547 individuals (CV=0.28) in 1991-1994, 742 individuals (CV=0.29) in 1996-2001 and 453 individuals (CV=1.04) in 2003-2004 (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Mullin 2007). The most recent uncorrected abundance estimate, again for both species combined, is 186 (CV=1.04) from a summer vessel-based survey in 2009 covering the waters from the 200m isobath to the seaward extent of the US EEZ (Garrison 2016). In the western North Atlantic, the most recent abundance estimate is 1,042 Dwarf Sperm Whales (CV=0.65) from a combination of vessel and aerial surveys conducted in JulyâAugust 2011 in offshore waters from North Carolina to the lower Bay of Fundy (Palka 2012). <em>Kogia</em> spp. strand frequently on beaches of the south-eastern United States. Between 1978 and 1987, Odell (1991) documented that the genus <em>Kogia</em> was the second most frequently stranded cetacean taxon between North Carolina and Texas, after the common bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>). From 2007â2015, 17 strandings of <em>Kogia</em> spp. were documented in Virginia, 81 in North Carolina, and 112 on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). The large number of strandings in these states suggests that <em>Kogia</em> are common off the US Atlantic coast, despite the fact that they are very seldom detected during visual surveys in these waters (Garrison <em>et al</em>. 2010). This was confirmed by a recent study that compared the detections of <em>Kogia</em> between visual survey and passive acoustic methods along the U.S. Atlantic coast, concluding that <em>Kogia</em> are indeed relatively common in shelf break and slope waters of the western North Atlantic between Virginia and Florida, and that they are not readily available to visual surveys in this region (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>The latest abundance estimate from the Hawaiian EEZ is 7,138 (CV=1.12) from a 2002 shipboard survey (Barlow 2006).

In the southwestern Indian Ocean, aerial survey data corrected for availability bias resulted in an abundance estimate of 683 (both species of <em>Kogia</em> combined) in the Mozambique Channel, the Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands (Laran <em>et al</em>. 2017). Florida (USA) and South Africa have the highest reported stranding rates in the world of both Pygmy and Dwarf Sperm Whales, which suggests that <em>Kogia </em>spp. are relatively common in these regions (Credle 1988, PlÃ¶n 2004).</p><br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Although the range of Dwarf Sperm Whales is poorly understood, they occur in oceanic waters of the warm temperate and tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from approximately 45Â°S to 45Â°N. The paucity of live sighting records is due at least partly to their inconspicuous behaviour rather than rarity. Dwarf Sperm Whales seem to be more abundant in tropical and subtropical waters. They occur in slightly warmer waters than Pygmy Sperm Whales (<em>Kogia breviceps </em>Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2015, McAlpine 2018). There is only one record of a Dwarf Sperm Whale in the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered extralimital. The northern-most record is from the Faroe Islands (Bloch and Mikkelsen 2009) and the presumed southern range limits include South Africa (PlÃ¶n 2004) and Southern Australia (Jefferson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). These whales are not known to migrate, but strandings in some regions are seasonal, which might indicate seasonal shifts in distribution. For example, in the north-eastern Atlantic, strandings occur mainly in autumn and winter (MacAlpine 2018). Dwarf Sperm Whales are most often observed over shelf breaks and in insular slope waters (McAlpine 2018). They are observed relatively frequently around certain oceanic islands such as the main Hawaiâian Islands (Baird <em>et al. </em>2013), Great Abaco in the Bahamas (Dunphy-Daly <em>et al. </em>2008), and Indian Ocean islands such as Mayotte, in the Mozambique Channel, around the Seychelles and in Pemba Channel, Tanzania (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010, Laran <em>et al. </em>2017, Braulik <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><br/><p></p>",<p>Dwarf Sperm Whales are hunted on rare occasions at a small scale in a few places (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>,Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

In the previous assessment (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008), the Baiji was evaluated as Critically Endangered (CR) (Possibly Extinct), as abundance was believed to be extremely low, and as the numerous serious threats it faced in the wild were still occurring. The last confirmed sighting of a Baiji was in 2002. Although the species is generally believed to be extinct (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007) sporadic unconfirmed reports of sightings mean that the species should remain as CR (Possibly Extinct), rather than Extinct (EX), pending the results of a range-wide survey planned for November-December 2017.</p>  <p>The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) based on the following criteria:</p>  <ul><li><strong>Criterion C2a:</strong> There were far fewer than 250 mature individuals, and, if the Baiji was not already extinct by 2008, a continuing decline in the numbers of mature individuals could be inferred or projected, and all individuals belonged to a single subpopulation.</li><li><strong>Criterion D: </strong>There were certainly fewer than 50 mature individuals. </li></ul>  <p>The following factors justify retaining the classification of the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) in the current assessment:  </p><ul><li>The last confirmed record of the species was in 2002 and its decline was well documented before its disappearance.</li><li>The âsevere threatening processesâ known to have occurred have not been significantly addressed and remain unabated.</li><li>The Baiji was confined to a single, albeit large, freshwater basin, which given the massive human presence there, âpredisposedâ the species to extinction.</li><li>If any individuals remained, their presence almost certainly would have been documented given the strong human presence in the speciesâ historical extent of occurrence.</li><li>Surveys conducted since the early 2000s, which failed to detect any Baijis, have been âadequate and appropriate to the speciesâ detectability.â The surveys were comprehensive in their coverage and included the use of both visual and acoustic techniques, with state-of-the-art equipment employed by experienced researchers. Local reports of sightings since 2002 are unconfirmed.</li><li>The Baijiâs habitat remains highly degraded and unsafe for other riverine megafauna. This is demonstrated by the fact that the Yangtze Finless Porpoise subspecies (<em>Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis</em>), which was sympatric with the Baiji, has continued to decline and is listed as CR (Wang<em> et al.</em> 2013). Other megafauna in the Yangtze River face a similar situation, including the CR (Possibly Extinct) Yangtze Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser dabryanus</em>)<em> </em>(Wei 2010a) and Chinese Paddlefish (<em>Psephurus gladius</em>)<em> </em>(Wei 2010b)<em> </em>and the CR Chinese Alligator (<em>Alligator sinensis</em>) (Crocodile Specialist Group 1996) and Yangtze Giant Softshell Turtle (<em>Rafetus swinhoei</em>) (Asian Turtle Trade Working Group 2000).</li></ul>","Baiji have been generally found in eddy counter-currents below meanders and channel convergences (Hua <em>et al</em>. 1989, Zhou and Li 1989, Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2003). They are known to prey on fish of many sizes and various species, including both surface and bottom feeders (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997).","<p></p><p>The decline in Baiji abundance was caused by a combination of factors. The most consequential were probably incidental mortality from interactions with fisheries and loss and/or degradation of habitat by water development and management of navigation channels (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2013). Other threats contributing to the speciesâ probable extinction include some level of direct historical exploitation (e.g., during Chinaâs âgreat leap forwardâ the Baijiâs traditionally venerated status as Goddess of the River was denounced and Baiji skin was used to produce handbags and gloves; Zhou and Zhang 1991), vessel strikes, harbour construction, sedimentation from poor land use practices, and pollution.<br/> <br/> Entanglement in fishing gear in the 1970s and 1980s was estimated to have been responsible for at least half of observed mortality (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Chen 1989, Zhou and Li 1989). Longlines with thousands of unbaited hooks used for snagging bottom fish (""rolling hooks"") accounted for seven of 13 entanglement deaths recorded in the lower Yangtze between 1978 and 1985 (Zhou and Li 1989) and 15 of 28 in the middle reaches between 1973 and 1983 (Zhou and Wang 1994). Additional deaths from entanglement in rolling hooks were documented in the 1990s (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998). Baijis often had scars and open wounds from rolling hooks, and hook remains were sometimes found in the stomachs of dead animals (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Zhou and Li 1989). Deaths also resulted from entanglement in gill nets and fyke nets (Zhou and Wang 1994). According to Zhou<em> et al.</em> (1998), both rolling hooks and fyke nets were banned in the Yangtze ""because both are harmful to fisheries resources, and because of incidental killing of Baiji,â but enforcement of these prohibitions was ""very difficult.""<br/> <br/> Electric fishing, although ""strictly banned"" in the Yangtze (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998), has been widely practised, particularly in the centre of the Baiji's distribution (International Whaling Commission (IWC) 2001). By the early 2000s this fishing method had come to be viewed as the most important and immediate direct threat to the Baiji's survival (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Although there are few direct observations to support this, it was reported that electric shocks killed Baijis outright (Chen and Hua 1989, IWC 2001). It is well known that such shocks can kill some other aquatic organisms, possibly including those that were prey of Baijis. In the 2006 Yangtze River survey, illegal fishing activities were observed daily along the river and 1,175 fishing vessels were logged between Yichang and Shanghai alone (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/> <br/> Propeller and vessel strikes have killed and injured Baijis (Zhou and Zhang 1991, Chen<em> et al.</em> 1997) and were considered a significant threat to the species, especially in view of the rapid industrial and economic growth of China with its associated expansion of traffic on the Yangtze (Chen 1989, Chen and Hua 1989, Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998). During the 2006 Baiji survey, a minimum of 19,830 large shipping vessels were counted (more than one vessel per 100 m of river surveyed) (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/> <br/> Explosives used to deepen or widen river channels or for fishing were another cause of Baiji mortality (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Zhou and Li 1989, IWC 2001).<br/> <br/> Water development has transformed the Baiji's habitat in important ways, for example blocking of animal movements by dams and barrages, eliminating access to tributaries and appended lakes, and reducing fish productivity<em></em>. A dead Baiji found at the bottom of a gate for a ship lock in a Yangtze tributary may have been killed accidentally by the structure (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000). Chen and Hua (1989) predicted that the controversial Three Gorges Dam, completed in the early 2000s, would eliminate counter-current habitat for approximately 200 km downstream and degrade the existing counter-current systems for another 160 km downstream. Further, stratification in the reservoir will have caused the water released below the dam to be cooler than previously, potentially affecting Baijis and their prey. The downstream effects of Gezhouba Dam were not as extreme as those predicted for Three Gorges Dam because the former is a low-head, run-of-the-river structure (Zhong and Power 1996), meaning that sediment is allowed to pass through (which allows the formation of the counter-currents where Baijis were often found) and no reservoir forms. Another effect of Three Gorges Dam was to facilitate large ship traffic in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and thereby increase the amount of underwater noise, and it would have increased the incidence of vessel strikes of Baijis (Chen and Hua 1989).<br/> <br/> Industrial expansion and intensified agriculture (both facilitated by water development) have caused major ecological problems in the Yangtze system. For example, Dongting and Poyang Lakes have become much shallower because of siltation from deforestation and agricultural development; in fact, it was suggested that Dongting Lake could disappear completely early in the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/> <br/> Pollutant loads in the Yangtze have increased with industrialization and the spread of modern agricultural practices. As of the 1990s, approximately 40% of China's industrial and agricultural output came from the Yangtze basin, with more than 16 billion cubic meters of wastewater discharged into the river annually, of which more than 12 billion cubic meters was industrially polluted and largely untreated (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998).</p>","The first estimate of abundance based on quantitative survey data (1979-81) was made by Zhou (1982), who concluded that the total population comprised only about 400 animals. On the basis of surveys conducted in 1985-86, Chen and Hua (1989) made an educated guess that the total population was around 300. Surveys by Zhou and Li (1989) between 1982 and 1986 suggested that there were 100 Baijis in a 770 km segment of the lower Yangtze from Hukou to the river mouth, compared with 78-79 dolphins counted by Chen and Hua (1989) in the same segment in 1985-86. Repeated surveys of a 500 km segment of the lower Yangtze (Nanjing-Hukou) in 1989-91 produced a maximal count of 12 individuals, leading Zhou <em>et al</em>. (1998) to infer a total abundance of about 30 Baijis in that river segment. Those authors reasoned that if the species still inhabited its historical range of about 1,700 linear kilometers of river, with a density similar to that found in their study area, the total population in the early 1990s would have been only about 100. Attempted comprehensive surveys of the entire species range in 1997-99 resulted in a maximal count (November 1997) of 13 dolphins (including one calf), leading to the generally accepted view that abundance had continued to decline and that the total population was by that time extremely small. The sighting rate in the three years of surveys declined at an annual rate of about 10% (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although no credible time series of counts or abundance estimates is available to provide a rigorous evaluation of trends, there is an overwhelming consensus that the Baiji population declined rapidly over several decades before its probable extinction in the early 2000s.<br/> <br/> The last documented sighting (supported by photographic evidence) was in 2002 and the last confirmed stranding was in 2001. In November and December 2006, a comprehensive visual and acoustic survey failed to find a single Baiji in the Yangtze River (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2007). Two research vessels covered the known habitat of Baijis from Yichang to Shanghai in both the upstream and downstream directions (for double coverage on both sides of the river). In addition, one vessel towed a hydrophone to listen for Baiji whistles and clicks during the downstream survey. Although Dongting and Poyang Lakes were not covered in the 2006 Yangtze mainstem survey, since 2000 no Baijis have been seen by researchers studying Finless Porpoises in those lakes. Another survey conducted for Finless Porpoises in 2012 also failed to detect any Baijis (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2014). One of the assessors (WD) received reports and hazy video footage of a Baiji sighting in the Tongling area of the Yangtze in 2007 but the species identification could not be confirmed. There are more recent unconfirmed reports of Baiji sightings by student volunteers and older fishermen but no photographic, video, or acoustic evidence is available to assess the reliability of these reports. In view of the unconfirmed reports, a precautionary approach has been taken by retaining the classification of the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) rather than changing it to EX, pending the results of a third range-wide survey from Yichang to Shanghai, using the same rigorous methods as were used in surveys conducted in 2006 and 2012, this time with more targeted survey effort in Tongling. If these surveys fail to find a Baiji, the case for changing the speciesâ status from Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) to Extinct will be particularly strong.",Decreasing,"The Baiji is endemic to the Yangtze River of China. Some individuals were seen in the Qiantang River, immediately south of the Yangtze, after the great flood of 1955 but they disappeared after construction of a hydropower station in 1957 (Zhou 2009). Baijis also occurred in Dongting and Poyang Lakes (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1977, Chen<em> et al.</em> 1980) but disappeared from both of these appended water bodies of the Yangtze by the 1990s (Yang<em> et al.</em> 2000, Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Their upstream limit in the Yangtze declined from the Three Gorges area approximately 35 km above Gezhouba Dam near Yichang in the 1940s to approximately 170 km below the dam site near Jingzhou (formerly called Shashi) in the 1990s (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003, Zhou 2009). These dolphins were once observed as far downstream as the river mouth near Shanghai (Zhou and Li 1989). No dolphins were found downstream of Jiangyin, located 256 km upstream of the mouth, during surveys in 1997-99 (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). During surveys in the late 1990s, Baijis were found mainly in several segments of the Yangtze between Tongling and Dongting Lake, such as the Tongling section, the Poyang Lake mouth area, and the Honghu section (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Turvey<em> et al.</em> (2010) concluded from community interviews along the length of the Yangtze River that while the Baiji steadily declined in abundance, this decline âwas not associated with any major contraction in geographical range across the middleâlower Yangtze drainage, even in the decade immediately before probable global extinction of the species.â Hazy video footage taken in the Tongling area of the Yangtze in 2007 may have been a Baiji but the species identification could not be confirmed. Also, during the last two years there have been unconfirmed reports of sightings made by a team of student volunteers and older fishermen near Tongling (Wang Ding, unpubl. data).<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>",There is no current trade in or use of this species or its products.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>In China, the Baiji is designated in the First Category of National Key Protected Wildlife Species and has full legal protection throughout its range. Protection from deliberate killing or injury appears to have been effective but, as noted under Threats, prohibitions on harmful fishing methods were generally not very effective and Baijis continued to suffer from the mortality, injury, and health impairment caused by the other threats listed.<br/> <br/> For several decades, those involved in trying to save the Baiji could not reach consensus on whether conservation should focus principally on <em>in situ</em> efforts to manage threats or on capturing some Baijis from the wild and moving them to a captive or semi-captive environment (IWC 2001, Reeves<em> et al.</em> 2003). From the late 1980s onwards, the primary strategy to prevent the Baiji's extinction was to capture as many dolphins as possible and to introduce them into ""semi-natural reserves,"" one of which (Tongling) was approved by the Chinese government in the 1980s, and the other (Shishou) in the 1990s. The approach of using semi-natural reserves as components of a broad-based conservation strategy was endorsed by international meetings of scientists in 1986 (Perrin and Brownell 1989) and 1993 (Ellis<em> et al.</em> 1993, Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1994). By 2005, establishment of an <em>ex situ</em> breeding population under semi-natural conditions was regarded as the essential short-term goal for the continued survival of the species (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2005, Reeves and Gales 2006, Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2006, Wang<em> et al.</em> 2006, Yang<em> et al.</em> 2006). This was premised on the assumption that the total population of the species was small and declining rapidly and that the factors responsible for the speciesâ decline (severe habitat degradation; rolling hook, electric and explosive fishing; and boat strikes) were still at work and may have been increasing. The favoured site for establishing this population was the Tian-e-zhou National Baiji Reserve, a 21 km oxbow appended to the Yangtze near Shishou City, Hubei Province, which since 1990 has supported a translocated breeding population of Yangtze Finless Porpoises. However, the expectation that sufficient numbers of Baijis could be caught and placed in the reserves to establish a viable <em>ex situ</em> population proved unrealistic. Six capture expeditions, each lasting 2-3 months, were conducted between Chenglingji and Gongan in the 1990s but Baijis proved extremely difficult to locate, track, and capture. In 1995, a female Baiji was caught and released in the Shishou reserve. Less than seven months later her carcass was found entangled in the escape prevention net at the outlet of the reserve. At that time, one other Baiji was in captivity â a male (Qi Qi) that had been rescued from fishing gear in 1980 and rehabilitated. Qi Qi remained alone in his dolphinarium tank at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan until he died in 2002 </p>  <p>The Scientific Committee of the IWC reviewed the status of the Baiji in 2000, but members were unable to reach consensus on whether further attempts at live-capture should be made (IWC 2001). The IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group recommended in 2003 that: (1) available resources should be devoted to eliminating the known threats to the species in its natural habitat; (2) immediate action should be taken at national, provincial and local levels to fully enforce the bans on rolling hooks and electric fishing; and (3) if the capture/translocation effort continues, capture operations should be improved to prevent dolphin injury or mortality, water quality in the reserve should be kept at a high standard, and Finless Porpoises should be removed to ensure against deleterious interactions between them and the Baiji(s) (Reeves<em> et al.</em> 2003). In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture developed a Baiji conservation plan emphasizing the <em>ex situ</em> approach (Ministry of Agriculture 2001).</p>  <p>The Yangtze region is home to approximately 10% of the worldâs human population and the Yangtze River has been undergoing progressive ecological deterioration for many decades. The Baiji is the victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled and unselective fishing (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007) </p>  <p>Conservation actions for Baijis may be too late to prevent its extinction. However, such actions can be justified by the fact that almost any substantial conservation measures in the Yangtze will benefit the Critically Endangered Yangtze Finless Porpoise, which is the worldâs only freshwater porpoise and was sympatric with the Baiji before the latterâs disappearance. Research should concentrate on confirming the presence or absence of Baijis through rigorous searching effort. This effort should include the range-wide survey planned for November to December 2017 from Yichang to Shanghai in both the upstream and downstream directions (for double coverage on both sides of the river) using visual observers with high-powered binoculars and an acoustic search with a towed hydrophone to listen for Baiji whistles and clicks. &#160;Searching effort should also include more intensive surveys using both visual and acoustic techniques in the area around Tongling where recent unconfirmed observations of Baijis were reported. If a Baiji is found during any of these surveys, the conservation recommendations made by the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group in 2003 (see above) would remain valid.</p>  <p>The Baiji is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</p>",Palearctic,2002,true,false,Global

The current global population is estimated at 135,000 and the mature population at about 84,000, which is higher than the level of three generations ago. This is true of the global population as well as the three main regional populations individually â North Pacific, North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. The species does not, therefore, qualify for a Red List threatened category, and is listed as Least Concern. The Arabian Sea subpopulation appears to be isolated, is very small, and is listed separately as Endangered (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p></p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>With few exceptions, such as the Arabian Sea population, Humpback Whales undertake long migrations between breeding grounds in tropical coastal waters in winter to feeding grounds in middle and high latitudes (Clapham 2018).<br/> <br/> In the Southern Hemisphere, they appear to feed mainly in the antarctic and subantarctic, where the diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids (Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>) (Mackintosh 1970), although some feeding has been observed in the Benguela Current ecosystem on the migration route west of South Africa (Best <em>et al</em>. 1995); suspected prey species in that region are euphausiids (<em>E. lucens</em><em>)</em> and amphipods (<em>Themisto gaudichaudii</em><em>)</em>. Some Humpback Whales feed in summer in mid-latitude (41Â°-44Â°S) Chilean waters (Hucke-Gaete<em> et al</em>. 2013) <br/> <br/> Few data on diet in other areas are available. Humpback Whales caught off Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1950s and 1960s were consuming mainly Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) (Mitchell 1973). Those caught off California in the early 20th century were eating mainly euphausiids and sardines (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1997). Humpback Whales caught in the northern North Pacific in the 1950s were feeding mainly on euphausiids and fish (Nemoto 1959). In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Humpback whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling worldwide since 1966, and there have been few catches since 1968. It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so. The figures submitted in 2018 for entanglements include: USA 78 (26 in the Atlantic in 2015, 52 in the Pacific in 2016); Australia 46; Greenland 5, Japan 3, and New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, and Spain (1 each) (Hughes 2019). The reported ship strike numbers were: USA 13, Australia 5, and Brazil 1. &#160;The figures include some potentially non-fatal incidents (such as whales entangled and released).<br/><br/>Minimum estimates of average annual deaths in US waters are: west coast (2012-16) - 16.7 from entanglement and 2.1 from ship strikes (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2018); east coast (2010-14) Â­â 7.2 from entanglements and 1.8 from ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Alaska and Hawaii (2011-15) â 18 from entanglements in fishing gear, 2.8 from unspecified marine debris, and 4.4 from ship strikes (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018). UrbÃ¡n <em>et al</em>. (2017) reported 95 cases of entanglement of Humpback Whales on the Mexican Pacific coast during 2004-2017 of which 42 were released, 6 died and the fate of the others was either unknown or considered not to be severely injured.<br/><br/>In a study of Humpback entanglements in Scottish fishing gear during 1992-2016, Ryan <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The last comprehensive assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2002 (IWC 2003), but more recent data are available for some areas. The abundance estimate for the West Indies group of breeding aggregations, obtained from photographic capture-recapture, was 10,752 whales in 1992-93 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.07) with an estimated annual rate of increase of 3.1% (standard error (SE) 0.5%) over the period 1979-93 (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2003). The latest abundance estimate for part of the Cape Verde Island population is 260 during 2010-2013, also from&#160;photographic capture-recapture&#160;(Ryan<em> et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The most recent estimates of abundance in the individual summer feeding grounds are: Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy - 823 in 2008 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Canadian Atlantic (Newfoundland, Labrador, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and Scotia Shelf) - 2,080 (CV 0.22) in 2007 (Lawson <em>and</em> Gosselin 2009); West Greenland - 993 (CV 0.46) in 2015 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); East Greenland coastal and central North Atlantic (Iceland, East Greenland, Faeroes, Jan Mayen) 10,031 (CV 0.36) in 2015 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018); northeastern Atlantic (British Isles, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea) 1,450 (CV 0.29) in 2001 (Ãien <em>et al</em>. 2009). These estimates total about 15,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.25.<br/><br/>The abundance of Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine and northwestern Atlantic was estimated to be growing at 6.5% per year during 1979-91 (Barlow and Clapham 1997) but the rate of increase was less than 4% per year during 1992-2000 (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003). Abundance in the central North Atlantic (East Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands) increased sharply from 1987 to 1995 but there has been no clear trend since then (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were subject to significant removals by pre-modern whalers especially in their wintering grounds in the West Indies and Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Reeves 2003). Whaling in the West Indies (including Bermuda) is partially documented from 1664, but the main period was 1826-1928, during which about 8,600 whales were estimated to have been killed (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001). Whaling in the Cape Verde Islands occurred primarily during 1850-1912 with a total estimated kill of about 3,000 animals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Humpbacks were exploited by modern whalers in their summer feeding grounds from the 1860s, especially off Iceland and Norway (JonsgÃ¥rd 1977<em>,</em> Allison 2017). About 3,200 Humpback Whales were recorded taken by early modern whaling during 1880-1916, mainly off northern Norway and Iceland. Allowing for a substantial struck and lost rate in early modern whaling, and considering that about 20% of the recorded catch of whales was unspecified to species, the total kill in this period may have exceeded 5,000 Humpback Whales.<br/><br/>About 1,500 Humpback Whales are reported to have been killed in the North Atlantic since 1916, from a variety of areas including the British Isles, Faeroes, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and eastern Canada, as well as Norwegian pelagic catches. Humpback Whales were protected from commercial whaling in the North Atlantic from the 1955 season by the IWC, except for small catches off Greenland (IWC 1954). However, catch levels had become very low by the 1920s, despite continued high catches of Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>). This suggests that the Humpback population was low at that time.<br/><br/>Attempts to estimate pre-whaling populations from catch, abundance and trend data have yielded inconclusive results (IWC 2003<em>,</em> Punt <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, the current population level is probably considerably higher than the 1942 level because only a small number of Humpbacks (377) were caught between 1942 and the start of the period (from 1979) over which an increase has been documented.<br/><br/>Using genetic methods, Roman and Palumbi (2004) estimated the pre-whaling population of&#160;Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic to be 240,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 156,000-401,000). However, their method assumed that North Atlantic Humpback Whales form a single clade, which they do not (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hence, the Roman and Palumbi estimate would be expected to reflect the global abundance of Humpback Whales prior to whaling rather than the North Atlantic population.<em><strong><br/><br/>North Pacific</strong></em><br/>The total abundance of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific was estimated by photographic capture-recapture at 21,063 (CV 0.04) during 2004-06 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). A comparable estimate from 1993-96 data, calculated retrospectively, was 9,500. The population appeared to have been increasing since 1980 at rates of 5-8% per year in each of the areas with sufficient data to estimate trend (Calambokidis and Barlow 2017). More recent data from the U.S. west coast suggest that numbers there have levelled off (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Using a different model for the relation between summering and wintering grounds applied to the same data as Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2011), Wade <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2016, revised by Wade 2017) estimated a total of 15,805 for the wintering grounds and 16,225 for the feeding grounds. It is not clear why Wadeâs totals are lower than Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>.âs, but all evidence indicates that the Hawaiian group is the largest of the wintering populations, comprising 10,000-12,000 whales and making up at least half of the total North Pacific population. Estimates for the other breeding populations are Mexican (2,000-5,000), Asian (1,000-2,000) and Central American (300-1,000); no estimate exists for the Western Pacific (Mariana Islands) area.<br/><br/>Independent of the above data, the abundance of Humpback Whales in the eastern North Pacific (170Â°E to 135Â°W) and the eastern Bering Sea has been estimated from the Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment (POWER) series of sightings surveys at 14,407 (CV 0.56) (Inai <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Humpback Whales are also abundant west of these areas, in the western Bering Sea and near the western Aleutian Islands, eastern and western Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands (Miyashita <em>et al</em> 2006<em>,</em> Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>,</em> Gushcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were hunted in Japan at least since 1570 and catching probably increased with the development of net-assisted whaling from circa 1677 (Kasuya 2018). The number taken is very uncertain because detailed catch figures prior to the 20th century are available from only two of about a dozen locations where whaling occurred in southern Japan, on both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts (Omura 1986).&#160;The proportion of whales killed but lost is also unclear: although quite high rates of escape were indicated, it is unclear how many of these would have been mortally wounded. A single whaling firm operating in Kyushu (southwestern Japan), among several known to have been active, took 21,790 whales between 1725 and 1874, of which the majority were likely Humpbacks judging from the species breakdown at neighbouring locations. The data suggest a decline towards the end of the 19th century, but not as marked as for North Pacific Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena japonica</em>).<br/><br/>Building on the works of Maury (1852) and Townsend (1935), Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted by month the positions of about 250 catches and a few sightings of Humpbacks in the North Pacific from a sample of logbooks of American sail whalers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&#160;Humpback Whales occurred in most of the summering and wintering areas known today, including the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk Sea. The logbooks are thought to comprise about 10% of all American voyages, but it is unclear how representative they are, especially of the earlier voyages. Furthermore, at least some European vessels were also active in the North Pacific.&#160;It is possible that a few thousand Humpback Whales were taken. Also in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, American shore-based whalers operating on the coast of California killed an estimated 2,000 Humpback Whales between 1854 and 1899 (Reeves <em>and</em> Smith 2010).<br/><br/>Modern whaling began in Japan in 1898 and catches by species are recorded since 1911. Humpback Whales made up only 2.0% (950 out of 47,343) of the catch of large whales in Japan (including the occupied Kuril Islands) during 1911-45, and only 0.2% (90 out of 48,010) of the catch of large whales in Japan during 1946-65 (Allison, 2017). Thus, the Asian migratory population was likely already depleted before the start of modern whaling, and already commercially extinct by the time the catching of Humpbacks in the North Pacific was prohibited by the IWC from 1966 (IWC 1965). Subgroups of the Asian wintering population that used more oceanic migratory corridors probably survived a bit longer, given that over 800 Humpbacks were taken in Ogasawara (Bonin Islands) between 1922-1945, nearly 800 in Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands) during 1958-62, and over 700 in Taiwan during 1920-39.<br/><br/>Approximately 18,000 Humpbacks are recorded as being taken by modern whaling along the American coasts during 1911-65 (5,000 in Alaska, 6,000 in British Columbia, 5,000 in California and Washington, and 2,000 off Baja California, Mexico) (Allison 2017). &#160;Modern pelagic whaling began in the 1930s and a total of over 8,000 Humpback Whales were taken, including 7,714 by fleets of the USSR, which illegally took 248 Humpback Whales after catches had been prohibited by the IWC (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Estimated catches of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific since 1942 total approximately 10,700 whales (Allison 2017). Given the evidence of an increase of over 10,000 whales between the 1980s and the early the 2000s, it is likely that the current population size in the North Pacific as a whole is above the 1942 level.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian wintering population is today the largest of the extant wintering populations. The 19<sup>th</sup> century records include relatively few catches or sightings of Humpbacks in this area, even though Hawaii was a major staging area for long-distance whalers in the Pacific. The thesis of Herman (1979) that Humpbacks were uncommon in Hawaii in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and earlier, based on the paucity of references to Humpbacks in contemporary accounts and local folklore, is controversial. However, it is plausible that Humpbacks were historically less abundant in Hawaii than they are today.<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Population estimates derived from photo-identification conducted in the Arabian Sea during 2000-04 were all less than 100 animals (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Provisional analysis of data collected during 2000-2015 yielded an abundance estimate of 89 whales (CV 0.26) in 2015, which may be negatively biased due to heterogeneity (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Soviet whaling fleet <em>Sovetskaya Ukraina</em> illegally took 238 Humpback Whales off the coasts of Oman, Pakistan, and northwestern India in November 1966 (Mikhalev 1997). The current population is very small and its current trend is not known. This population is listed separately as Endangered under Red List criterion D (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>Results of the IWC Scientific Committeeâs multi-year âcomprehensive assessmentâ of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, completed in 2015, are summarized by IWC (2016). The estimated total population size in 2015 was 97,000 (CI 78,000-118,000),&#160;obtained from a mix of photographic and genetic capture-recapture, aerial surveys, and shore-based censuses. The estimated total population size in 1942, from a fitted population model, was about 60,000 (confidence interval not given) while the estimated âpre-whalingâ population size in 1900 was 138,000 (CI 112,000-198,000). All breeding populations were estimated to have recovered to a substantial fraction of their pre-whaling abundance, except for the West South Africa (BSB2) population, which may still be quite depleted.<br/><br/>The IWC comprehensive assessment assumed that catches by pre-modern whalers were small enough, or long enough ago, to be ignored. However, de Morais <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated catches of 11,000-33,000 Humpback Whales from pre-modern land whaling stations (armaÃ§Ãµes) in Brazil during 1830-1924, and considered it likely that there had been similarly sizeable catches in the preceding century. From samples of logbooks of late 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century sail whalers, Townsend (1935) and Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted positions for about 2,000 Humpback catches and sightings in the Southern Hemisphere. These show presence of Humpbacks in most of the wintering grounds known today, except for northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef probably made access too risky. The 19<sup>th</sup> century whalers did not follow their prey to their Antarctic summering grounds. No attempt has yet been made to estimate total removals from the logbook samples.<br/><br/>The recorded catches by 20<sup>th</sup> century whaling in the Southern Hemisphere total about 220,000, after allowing for some Humpbacks among the 5,000 unspecified whales taken in the early years (Allison 2017). Of the total, about 83,500 were taken by pelagic whaling fleets in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, which started in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century mainly south of 55Â°S; about 40,000 from land stations in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, mainly at South Georgia; about 29,000 along the west coast of southern Africa (Gabon, Angola, Namibia, and western South Africa); about 20,000 in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mozambique, and Natal (South Africa); over 28,000 off western Australia; over 14,000 off eastern Australia and New Zealand; about 2,500 in the Southeast Pacific (Chile, Peru, and Ecuador); and about 2,000 off Brazil.<br/><br/>Attempts by the IWC to manage the hunting of Humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere had limited effect. Takes of Humpbacks by pelagic fleets in the Southern Ocean (south of 40Â°S) were prohibited in the initial Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling that was adopted in 1946 and came into force in 1948. This ban was relaxed from 1950 to allow an annual catch of 1,250 Humpbacks, but the numerical limit was often exceeded and was dropped from 1954 when Humpback catching was instead limited to four days in February. From 1959, increasingly restrictive area limits were imposed. The report of an IWC expert group in June 1963 inferred from the continuing steep decline in the Humpback population that substantial unreported catches had occurred (Chapman 1964). The IWC finally banned all catching of Humpbacks throughout the Southern Hemisphere from 1964 (IWC 1965). Subsequently, it emerged that Humpback catches by the USSR fleets had indeed exceeded the reported values by about 46,000 whales, and had continued until 1968, with small takes continuing until 1973 (Zemsky <em>et al</em>. 1996<em>,</em> Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even before the 1964 Humpback ban, almost all of the additional Soviet catches had been illegal in at least one respect: they were either outside the permitted season, outside the permitted areas, below the minimum allowed body size, or of mothers with calves.<br/><br/>The IWC Scientific Committeeâs recent comprehensive assessment, which took account of the previously unreported catches, showed that the current hemispheric population was, by now, very likely above its 1942 level. The assessment probably reflects the current population size and the trends over recent decades quite well, but both the estimates of pre-whaling population size, and the projections of future recovery, are probably more uncertain than the assessment results suggest, for the following reasons; firstly, as noted above, the pre-modern catches may not have been insignificant; secondly, simulation studies by Leaper <em>et al</em>. (2011) showed that alternative assumptions about density-dependent limitation can yield substantially different estimated population trajectories for both the past and the future; finally, Clapham and Zerbini (2015) cautioned that a key model assumption, that all historical breeding areas will be repopulated, may not hold when social factors are considered.<em><strong><br/><br/>Global Assessment</strong></em><br/>The mean age at first reproduction for Humpback Whales is estimated to be 10-12 years in the Southern Hemisphere (Best 2011) with a similar value in the North Pacific (Gabriele <em>et al</em>. 2007). Clapham (1992) reported a value of 5-7 years for Humpbacks in the Gulf of Maine, North Atlantic, but this increased to about 9 years for cohorts born in 1987 and later (Robbins 2007). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) cited 6 years as a reasonable default value, based on Clapham (1992). Taking a compromise value of 10 years, the generation time of 21.5 years estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) would become 25.5 years. Hence the 3-generation time window for applying the reduction criterion (A1) for a threatened category is 1942-2018.<br/><br/>Using the proportion mature of 0.62 estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007), the recent global population contains approximately 84,000 mature individuals out of a total of 135,000 whales. The population in 2018 is estimated to be above the 1942 level in each of the major ocean regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Hemisphere). The small Arabian Sea population is probably below the 1942 level, because of the illegal catches taken in the 1960s.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p></p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all the major ocean basins, and all but one of the subpopulations (that of the Arabian Sea) migrate between mating and calving grounds in tropical waters, usually near continental coastlines or island groups and productive colder-water feeding areas in temperate and high latitudes (Dawbin 1966, Clapham and Mead 1999). There tends to be strong, maternally directed fidelity to feeding and breeding grounds, but with some interchange between grounds, especially of males but also of females (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>Humpbacks in the North Atlantic range in summer from the Gulf of Maine in the west to the British Isles and Norway in the east. The northern extent of the Humpback's range includes the Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Davis Strait, but unlike Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>), they do not enter the pack ice. A number of main feeding grounds have been identified: Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, west of Greenland, west of Iceland, northeast Iceland, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, Bear Island, and western Svalbard (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Smaller numbers have been observed feeding in other areas such as the Hudson River Estuary (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2018). Humpback Whales are rare in the central and southern North Sea and there are very few records from the Baltic Sea. Humpback Whales were previously very rare in the Mediterranean Sea; there has been a notable increase in sightings since 1990, but they are still not common (Russo <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The main wintering grounds are in the West Indies and wider Caribbean region where they are found along the entire Antillean arc from Cuba to Venezuela (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest aggregations occur on Silver and Navidad Banks near the Dominican Republic, with much lower numbers in Samana Bay (Dominican Republic), off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico, and around the Virgin Islands and the eastern Antilles. Smaller numbers winter around the Cape Verde Islands (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009). There is some interchange of individuals between the eastern and western Atlantic wintering grounds (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2016), and some whales may remain in colder, more northern waters throughout the winter (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1993<em>,</em> MagnÃºsdÃ³ttir <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>,</em> Kowarski 2018).<br/><br/>While whales wintering in the Caribbean region have been matched photographically or genetically with whales in each of the summer feeding grounds, whales from the smaller Cape Verde Islands wintering group have to date been matched only with the northeastern feeding grounds. Individuals from the Cape Verdes have also been observed in spring in the Azores, where they appear to stop over to feed while on their way north (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009<em>,</em> Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011). The genetic and photographic evidence suggests that some of the whales on the Icelandic and Norwegian feeding grounds migrate in winter to an unknown area other than the West Indies or the Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Pike 2009).<br/><br/>The Humpback Whales that occur in the austral winter north of the equator along the African coast from Gabon to Guinea are known or presumed to be Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales (Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong></strong><br/>In the North Pacific, the Humpback Whaleâs summer range covers shelf waters from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, the Aleutian chain and Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, and northeastern Japan (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Humpbacks were hunted in the Sea of Japan and the Okhotsk Sea and in the past (Kasuya 2018<em>,</em> Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). They were for some time rare in the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), but recently have been seen in the eastern and northern Okhotsk Sea (Guschcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>,</em> Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Humpbacks are not common in the Sea of Japan but continue to be taken occasionally as bycatch in Korean waters. Recent occurrence in the Beaufort Sea may be linked to warming climate trends (Hashagen <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds identified to date include (from west to east) are: 1) Asian â Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), and northern Philippines; 2) west-central Pacific (presumed to be the area of the Mariana Islands, including Guam); 3). Hawaiian; 4) Mexican - Baja California, Gulf of California, Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Mexican mainland; and 5) Central American â Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia (IWC 2018a).<br/><br/>The least well-known wintering area is the west-central Pacific, because only a few whales have been observed there (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017), but the existence of a substantial wintering ground had been inferred from the substantial proportion of Humpback Whales in the Aleutian Islands that could not be matched to other known wintering grounds (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). It remains to be determined whether this is the Marianas region, which was a Humpback whaling ground in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (Townsend 1935).<br/><br/>The Central American wintering ground overlaps the winter range of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, but there is probably not much temporal overlap because the Southern Humpback Whales occupy the area in the austral winter (Rasmussen <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Small numbers of Humpbacks have recently been seen at previously unknown winter locations such as Amami-Ohshima Island (28Â°N 129Â°E) and HachijÅ-jima Island (33Â°N 140Â°E, about 300km south of Tokyo, Japan) (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The various wintering populations have different summer distributions but with considerable overlap. The whales wintering off Central America and mainland Mexico feed mainly off the coasts California, Oregon and Washington (USA), while whales from the Revillagigedo Islands feed mainly in the Gulf of Alaska (UrbÃ¡n <em>et al</em>. 2017). Whales wintering off Hawaii are found in summer mainly in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska (including Southeast Alaska) and the waters of British Columbia (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most of the whales summering off Kamchatka migrate to the Asian wintering grounds, a lower number to the Hawaiian grounds, and a few to the Mexican grounds (Titova <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Movements between wintering grounds have also been documented (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008) but these appear to be sufficiently few that the wintering populations remain genetically differentiated, especially with respect to mtDNA, which reflects maternal lineages (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><em></em><br/>The majority of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales migrate to the Antarctic in summer. They are abundant throughout the Antarctic in summer south to the ice edge, but not within the pack ice zone. There are also subantarctic summer feeding grounds around South Georgia (Dawbin 1966<em>,</em> Engel <em>and</em> Martin 2009) and the Fuegian archipelago (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some mothers with calves remain in mid-latitude waters in the Chilean fjords in the summer (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the winter, Southern Hemisphere whales aggregate in specific nearshore breeding areas in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, at least two of which extend north of the equator, i.e. off Colombia and Central America in the eastern Pacific and in the Bight of Benin (5Â°N, 2Â°E) in the eastern Atlantic. Some wintering grounds are fairly localized, for example around island groups, and some are more diffuse, such as along the west coast of southern Africa and the coast of West Africa. As evidenced by acoustic detections, part of the population remains in the Antarctic in winter (van Opzeeland <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The currently known wintering grounds, with the names originally assigned by the International Whaling Commissionâs Scientific Committee (IWC 1998) but with some subsequent regrouping (IWC 2017), are:<br/><br/>A. Western South Atlantic: Coast of Brazil from Cabo SÃ£o Roque (5Â°S) to Cabo Frio (23Â°S), but especially on the Abrolhos Bank (17-20Â°S);<br/><br/>B. Eastern South Atlantic: Benin Bight and Gulf of Guinea, from the waters of the Republic of Congo to the waters of Guinea (B1), West coast of southern Africa, including waters of South Africa, Namibia and Angola (B2);<br/><br/>C. Southwestern Indian Ocean: Coast of Natal, northeastern South Africa &#160;East Africa, including waters of Mozambique, Tanzania (incl. Zanzibar), Mayotte and the Comoros Islands (C1+C2), Eastern and southern Madagascar, RÃ©union and Mauritius (C3+C4);<br/><br/>D. Western Australia: migration along the west Australian coast to wintering grounds off northwestern Australia;<br/><br/>E. Eastern Australia and Southwest Pacific: Eastern Australia (E1),<br/><br/>F. Oceania: New Caledonia (E2), Fiji and Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), French Polynesia (F2);<br/><br/>G. Eastern South and equatorial Pacific: &#160;Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The groups A-G were originally considered to represent main breeding populations with the numbered sub-groups representing subpopulations. However, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently grouped subgroups E2, E3, F1 and F2 together as the Oceania breeding population. Subgroups C1 and C2 were combined, as have C3 and C4.<br/><br/>The feeding ranges of the different populations overlap in the Antarctic, with some movement of individuals around the Antarctic (IWC 1998), but overall the whales appear to feed preferentially in the sectors nearest to their wintering grounds. The sex ratio in the wintering areas tends to be biased towards males, potentially reflecting a reduced presence of females in their non-calving years or a generally shorter residence time of females (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rare movements of both sexes between breeding populations have been observed (e.g., western Africa to Madagascar (Pomilla and Rosenbaum 2005) and Brazil to Madagascar (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2011)).<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><em><strong></strong></em><br/>There is a resident year-round population in the Arabian Sea, whose range includes the waters of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011) and which is genetically isolated from other Humpback Whales (Pomilla <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, song types characteristic of Humpback Whales in the southwestern Indian Ocean have been detected off Oman (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2018); this could indicate the presence of Humpbacks from different populations in the Arabian Sea, or that Arabian Sea Humpbacks sometimes venture further afield and acquire new songs.<br/><br/>Only a few calves have been seen in the Arabian Sea, but from foetus sizes in pregnant whales captured in November 1966, Mikhalev (1997) concluded that the peak calving season is probably in February, with some spread. This is in contrast to Southern Humpback Whales, where peak calving occurs in July-August (Clapham and Mead 1999).<br/><br/>There have been a few records in the Persian Gulf, including the type specimen for <em>M. indica</em> (Gervais 1883) assumed to be a Humpback Whale; these were previously regarded as vagrants, but it is now thought that the regular range extends into the Persian Gulf (Dakhteh <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales seem to be quite rare in Indian waters (Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008) but there have been occasional strandings (Sutaria 2018) and acoustic detections (Madhusudhana <em>et al</em>. 2018) along the west coast. Of 14 individuals satellite-tagged off Oman during 2014-17, one was tracked to Goa and thence to the southern tip of India by January 2018 and back to the tagging site by March 2018 (Willson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two specimens from the west coast of Sri Lanka (a bycatch in 1981 and a stranding in 1990) (Ilangakoon 2006) and Humpback Whale songs have been during February and March 1982 in the Gulf of Mannar, NW Sri Lanka (Whitehead 1985). Humpback Whales seem to be rare or absent in the northeastern Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.<br/><br/>There have been several sightings over the past 10 years in the northern Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba, but the provenance of those Humpback Whales is unclear (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Large-scale exploitation of this species has ceased, but hunting for local consumption continues in Greenland and the island of Bequia (eastern&#160; Caribbean) (IWC 2018b).

The last substantial catches occurred in 1968. Despite having been severely depleted to a world population in the low thousands at that time, Humpbacks have recovered strongly to a world population that is estimated at over 80,000 mature animals and is increasing.<br/><br/>Humpback Whales enjoy additional protective measures, such as sanctuaries, in a number of countries.

DD was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.â Although the information is sparse, this species appears to span the colder waters of the North Atlantic and is may be fairly common in some areas, and therefore the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied.

There are around 60 records of this species, almost all of which are strandings and fishery entanglement deaths; the only live sightings that we are aware are several observations made far off the coast of Oregon (USA) during one day in 1994 (Hamilton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009; R.

Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.â Although the information is sparse, this species has the most extensive distribution of any species in the <em>Mesoplodon</em> genus, and the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied. Therefore, it was concluded that the species does not belong in the DD category. </p>  <p>This species is common in many areas but it is potentially vulnerable to low-level threats in some parts of its range. Therefore, the species is listed as LC. However, localized populations are known and threats from anthropogenic noise could result in subpopulations that would qualify for threatened categories.</p>","<p>Blainvilleâs Beaked Whale sightings are common enough around some oceanic archipelagos that long-term studies have been conducted for years (e.g., Canary Islands, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Reyes SuÃ¡rez 2017; Hawaiian Islands, Schorr <em>et al.</em> 2009, Baird 2019; Bahamas, Joyce <em>et al</em>. 2017); consequently, there is much more known about <em>M. densirostris</em> than any other mesoplodont (see Allen <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012; and Baird 2019 for recent reviews). Like all beaked whales, Blainvilleâs Beaked Whale is a deep diver, found mainly in deep, oceanic waters, but they can occur close to shore, especially around islands and continental shelf edges (MacLeod and Zuur 2005). In Hawaii, there appears to be a resident, island-associated population, and a more pelagic, open-ocean population with overlapping ranges. There is high site-fidelity among the Hawaii resident types, with re-sightings spanning more than 20 yr in some cases (Baird <em>et al.</em> 2011, Baird 2019). Median group size in Hawaii is 3 (range 1-11), generally with no long-lasting associations, and most groups have only a single adult male present.</p>  <p>Maximum dive depth and time recorded for Blainvilleâs Beaked Whale in Hawaii is 1,599 m and 83.4 min, respectively; it regularly dives to 1000 m and for over 1 hr, which, for slope-inhabiting populations, suggests that they are foraging at or near the bottom (Arranz <em>et al</em>. 2011, Baird <em>et al</em>. 2006, Baird 2019). Three different types of dives have been recorded: long, deep dives for foraging; short, shallow (2-4 m) dives near the surface for breathing, and a series of intermediate dives (30-300 m) that appear to help them avoid detection by predators (sharks and killer whales) when they are near the surface (Augilar de Soto <em>et al.</em> 2011, Baird 2019).</p>  <p>Little is known about the prey of Blainvilleâs Beaked Whale. A review by Allen <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that stomach contents from stranded whales consisted mainly of beaks and otoliths from various species of meso- and bathypelagic squids and fishes, and some crustaceans. Like all ziphiids, Blainvilleâs Beaked Whale is a suction feeder (Heyning and Mead 1996), and Madsen <em>et al.</em> (2013) suggested they catch, on average, about 25 individual prey items/dive.</p>","<p>There has never been a directed fishery for this species, but small numbers are taken opportunistically and incidentally in fishing gear. Dolar (1994) investigated directed fisheries for marine mammals in the Philippines and reported that hunters at Pamilacan Island sometimes take small whales, including <em>M. densirostris</em>. Also taken opportunistically in the past off Japan. Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts are known to become entangled and drowned (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009), including Blainvilleâs Beaked Whale (Jefferson et al. 1993, Ilangakoon 2002, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Blainvilleâs Beaked Whales are occasionally hooked in longline gear (Forney 2010).<br/> <br/> Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). In 1993, an adult Blainville's Beaked Whale that washed ashore in southern Brazil had a bundle of plastic threads that occupied a large part of the main stomach chamber (Secchi and Zarzur 1999). Both stomach and intestines were completely free of parasites, as well as food remains and feces, indicating that the whale had not fed for some time. The ingested plastic may have resulted in a false sensation of satiation for the animal, which could have reduced the whale's appetite and meal size and, in turn, led to the death of the whale. This form of pollution may be increasing and could be a threat to the species.</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as those from active sonar and seismic survey operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of mid-frequency active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in mass strandings of beaked whales, including Blainvilleâs Beaked Whales (Balcomb and Claridge 2001,&#160; DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bernaldo de QuirÃ³s <em>et al</em> . 2019). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bernaldo de QuirÃ³s <em>et al</em> . 2019). Sub-lethal effects may also occur, with Blainvilleâs Beaked Whales reducing foraging activity (as measured by echolocation) and moving away from Navy vessels using mid-frequency active sonar (e.g., Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2016; Manzano-Roth <em>et al</em>. 2016; Joyce <em>et al.</em> 2020). This has the potential to result in reduced reproductive rates for individuals that are regularly exposed to mid-frequency active sonar (New <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, although the nature of impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in various species of mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987), including moderate levels in Blainvilleâs Beaked Whales (Taruski <em>et al</em>., 1975, Aguilar<em> et al</em>. 1982; Bachman <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>  <p>Mesoplodonts are small whales that normally live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some cases have been reported (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2009, Schoeman <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160; </p>","<p>Overall, Blainvilleâs Beaked Whale is fairly common in at least some areas of its range and is considered to be perhaps the most abundant species of <em>Mesoplodon</em> (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Estimates of abundance are generally unavailable for most areas. In the Hawaiian EEZ waters Bradford <em>et al</em>. (in press) estimated 839 (CV=1.05) Blainvilleâs Beaked Whales in 2002, 1,740 (CV=1.05) in 2010, and 1,132 (CV=.99) in 2017. Off Hawaii Island Baird <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated 125 âmarkedâ individuals (CV=.30) using photo-identification over a four-year period (2003-2006), with a corrected estimate (accounting for unmarked individuals) of 140. Mullin and Fulling (2004) estimated 106 (CV=.41) mesoplodonts in the northern Gulf of Mexico, including both <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. europaeus</em>. Waring <em>et al.</em> (2009) later estimated 57 (CV=1.40) mesoplodonts (<em>i.e</em>., <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. europaeus</em>, combined) in the Gulf of Mexico from a later set of surveys. Ferguson and Barlow (2001) estimated a total of 32,678 mesoplodonts in the eastern Pacific (corrected for missed animals), in an area where nearly all the identified mesoplodonts are either <em>M. peruvianus</em> or <em>M. densirostris</em> (Pitman and Lynn 2001, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009). During a line transect acoustic and visual survey of the entire coast of Tanzania, Blainvilleâs Beaked Whales were the fourth most frequently encountered marine mammal (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2018). In areas where satellite tagging and/or photo-identification studies have been undertaken (e.g., Hawaii, Bahamas, Canary Islands) limited movements and strong site fidelity have been documented, suggesting substantial population structure (Baird 2019, Claridge 2013, Joyce <em>et al.</em> 2020, Reyes SuÃ¡rez 2017). </p>",Unknown,"<p>Blainvilleâs Beaked Whales are easily the most widely distributed of all the mesoplodont species and occur in tropical and warm temperate waters of all oceans (Mead 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006, Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012). They mostly occur in open ocean waters, but also in some semi-enclosed deep-sea areas, such as the Sea of Japan, Gulf of Thailand, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea but they have not been recorded in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160; In the tropical Western Indian Ocean, Blainvilleâs Beaked Whales are the most frequently encountered mesoplodont and occur around several island archipelagos including Comoros, Mauritius, Mayotte and the Seychelles (Kiszka 2015, Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; In the eastern North Pacific, sightings and strandings have occurred from 37.3Â°N to 41.5Â°S in cooler waters&#160;but are rare in this region (MacLeod <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>",<p>This species is occasionally taken in artisanal fisheries (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>,Marine,"<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Thus, Pygmy Beaked Whale abundance is likely to be in the tens of thousands.",Unknown,"<p>The Pygmy Beaked Whale is currently known from at least 36 specimens from Chile to central California, and there have been dozens of at-sea sightings of this distinctive species in the tropical and warm temperate eastern Pacific, including into the Gulf of California (Hamilton et al. 2008, Reyes and Van Waerebeek 2018). These records extend from about 43Â°S to 37Â°N, and observations at sea suggest that <em>M. peruvianus </em>occurs most commonly off western Mexico and is probably endemic to the eastern tropical Pacific. There are numerous records from Peru but to date only a single stranding  record from Chile where it may be extralimital (Reyes <em>et al.</em> 1991,  Sanino <em>et al.</em> 2007). A single stranding in New Zealand is also assumed to be an extralimital record (Baker and Van Helden 1999).</p>",Bycaught individuals are sold for human consumption (Reyes and van Waerebeek 2018).,Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Data Deficient was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Red List Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.â Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and around the northern rim of the North Pacific, and the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied. Therefore, it was concluded that the species does not belong in the DD category. </p>  <p>Stejnegerâs Beaked Whale appears to be uncommon (see Supplementary Information for definitions of terms etc.). Recurrent mass strandings near a naval facility in the Aleutian Islands indicate that anthropogenic noise could be a serious threat throughout a significant portion of the speciesâ medium-sized range. Assuming a generation length of about 20 years for deep-diving small whales (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2008), a population decline of 2%/year, which is plausible for the combined threats documented in this assessment, would result in a 70% decline over three generations and would qualify the species for EN under criterion A4d. However, it is also plausible that the combined effects of all threats to Stejnegerâs Beaked Whales are sustainable, which would indicate an LC listing. Near Threatened is chosen as the appropriate category for this data-poor species as the combined threats result in the species being close to qualifying for a threatened category, or likely to qualify in the near future.</p>","Stejneger's Beaked Whales occur mostly in deep water beyond the edge of the continental shelf (Houston 1990; Loughlin and Perez 1985). A peak in strandings in Japan during winter and spring suggests that they migrate northward in summer (Mead 1989; Yamada 1997). Based on evidence from bite wounds from cookiecutter sharks (<em>Isistius</em> spp.), Walker and Hanson (1999) also suggested Stejnegerâs undergo seasonal movements to warmer waters where this shark is more common (Dwyer and Visser 2011). Stomach contents from stranded animals in the western Aleutian Islands and Japan were dominated by two squid families â Gonatidae and Cranchiidae; all squid were presumed to have been taken at depths of 200 m or more, and no fish remains were found (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 1995, Walker and Hanson 1999). Pod sizes of up to 15 animals were reported by Loughlin <em>et al.</em> (1982), but species identification for their sightings cannot be confirmed (Pitman <em>et al</em>. 2019).","<p>Little specific information is available on anthropogenic threats to Stejnegerâs Beaked Whales (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). </p>  <p>Although formerly hunted occasionally in small numbers off Japan, currently there is no directed hunt for this species. Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts, including this species, are known to become entangled and drown in such gear in the Sea of Japan and California (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Park 1999). The full extent of the entanglement threat to Stejnegerâs Beaked Whale is unknown.</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause of the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;Recurrent mass strandings (8 such events between 1975 and 2018) of apparently healthy Stejnegerâs Beaked Whales have occurred near a US naval installation in the Aleutian Islands (Walker<em> </em>and Hanson 1999, Baumann-Pickering et al. 2011). Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). Plastic twine was found in the digestive tracts of two Stejnegerâs Beaked Whales, and Walker and Hanson (1999) suggested that this material was ingested incidentally during suction feeding. Yamada <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported that ca. 73% of the stranded specimens in Japan had plastic material in their stomachs. </p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in various other species of mesoplodonts (Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Kajiwara<em> et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). The levels of these residues in mesoplodonts are generally lower than in other small cetaceans but Stejnegerâs Beaked Whale is an exception. The organochlorine levels in this species, at least in Japanese waters, are the highest reported for any species of beaked whale and may represent a potential health hazard of unknown significance</p>  <p>Mesoplodonts are small whales that live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes is difficult to document, but some possible cases were reported by Waring <em>et al</em>. (2009). In addition, Honma <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported a Stejnegerâs Beaked Whale killed by a vessel in the Sea of Japan. </p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species, although the nature of these impacts is unknown at this time (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of abundance, but, based on strandings in the Aleutian Islands and western Japan, the species does not seem to be especially rare; in Japan alone, 120 strandings were reported between 1999 and 2011 (Tajima <em>et al. </em>2015). There may be a resident subpopulation in the Sea of Japan and southern Okhotsk Sea (Yamada 1997, Walker and Hanson 1999, Kakuda and Yamada 2001, Tajima <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Stejneger's Beaked Whales are found in continental slope and oceanic waters of the North Pacific Ocean, from southern California northward in the east and from the Sea of Japan, including the Korean Peninsula (Park 1999), northward into the southern Okhotsk Sea in the west. They also occur around the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea and throughout the Aleutian Islands (Mead 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006, Yamada 1997). Stejnegerâs Beaked Whale appears to be primarily a cold-temperate and subarctic species, and it is the only mesoplodont found in Alaskan waters. It strands most commonly in Alaska, especially in the Aleutian Islands and on the west coast of Japan, with many fewer strandings along Japanâs Pacific coast. </p>",,Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Global trends in abundance are not available, however, worldwide abundance is at least 180,000 based on the sum of estimates from the eastern tropical Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and the southwestern Indian Ocean.&#160; Since these estimates refer to only a small proportion of the range of the species, the actual total abundance is likely considerably greater. Threats that could cause declines include high levels of anthropogenic sound, especially military sonar and bathymetric surveys, and localized interactions with drift gillnet and pelagic longline fisheries. </p>  <p>The Melon-headed Whale was assessed as Least Concern in 2008. The species has a moderate global abundance and a widespread tropical distribution, and while there is little information available on trends in abundance, no major threats have been identified that are likely to be causing a global decline of the species. It is therefore again assessed as Least Concern.</p>","<p>Melon-headed Whales occur in deep oceanic waters. Sightings are relatively rare over the continental shelf (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009). They can be common around some oceanic islands where ocean bottom topography is steep (for a review see Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009). They are primarily distributed in waters ranging from 300 to 2,000 meters in depth (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009; Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2011; Baird <em>et al</em>. 2013; Aschettino <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the eastern tropical Pacific, the distribution of sightings suggests that the oceanic habitat of this species is primarily in upwelling-modified and equatorial waters (Perryman<em> et al</em>. 1994). Off the main Hawaiian Islands, Melon-headed Whales use cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies as offshore foraging grounds (Woodworth <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>Around the main Hawaiian Islands, two populations have been identified using photo-identification data: one exclusively observed in the coastal waters (median depth of encounter = 381 m) off the northwestern region of the island of Hawaiâi and another larger population occurring in deeper oceanic waters (median depth of encounter = 1,662 m) throughout the main Hawaiian Islands (Aschettino <em>et al.</em> 2012). Recent genetic studies conducted across the three main ocean basins suggest that Melon-headed Whales, including those that are resident to oceanic islands, maintain a relatively high level of genetic connectivity compared to other species of large delphinids such as Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala</em> spp.), Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) and other âblackfishâ (Martien <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Melon-headed Whales usually form large groups of up to 1,000 individuals, but these groups usually contain an assemblage of smaller units (Brownell <em>et al.</em> 2009). They also frequently associate with other species, such as Fraserâs Dolphins (<em>Lagenodelphis hosei</em>) and Short-finned Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala macrorhynchus</em>) (Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2006; Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Melon-headed Whales are nocturnal predators feeding on a variety of mesopelagic fishes, squids, and shrimps (Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2011, West <em>et al</em>. 2018). In Hawaii, the relative contribution of mesopelagic fish and cephalopods is roughly equivalent (West <em>et al</em>. 2018). Melon-headed Whales (along with other large delphinids such as False Killer Whales <em>Pseudorca crassidens</em>) could be important foraging facilitators for species of epipelagic seabirds foraging in tropical oligotrophic waters, particularly Procellariiformes (Pitman and Balance 1992; Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2015).","<p>Melon-headed Whales were hunted in Hawaii at least in the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century. They were hunted historically in the Solomon Islands in small numbers. They are killed occasionally in small-scale hunts targeting cetaceans, including in Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the eastern Caribbean Sea (Caldwell <em>et al.</em> 1975; Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993; Perryman <em>et al</em>. 1994; Dolar <em>et al</em>. 1994; Ilangakoon 1997; Mustika 2006). In the past, Melon-headed Whales were taken only occasionally in Japanese hunts (Kasuya 2017), however, catches have increased recently in the drive hunt off Taiji. In the 2017/2018 season the catch limit was 704 individuals and at least 7 groups were driven ashore to be killed or for use in aquariums (IWC 2018). Dolar <em>et al</em>. (1994) investigated the hunts for marine mammals in the central and southern Visayas, northern Mindanao and Palawan, Philippines. Hunters at several sites took Melon-headed Whales for bait or human consumption. In Sri Lanka, Ilangakoon (1997) reported that about 4% of the cetaceans delivered to four fish landing sites between May 1985 and December 1988 were Melon-headed Whales, at least some of them taken by harpoon.</p>  <p>Melon-headed Whales exhibit injuries due to interactions with pelagic longline fisheries in the Mozambique Channel (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2008). Incidental captures in offshore tuna fisheries are rare in the eastern tropical Pacific (Perryman <em>et al. </em>1994), and have not been recorded in purse-seine fisheries in the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Escalle <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, bycatch of this species has been recorded in tuna drift gillnet fisheries in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997) and India (Jeyabaskaran and Vivekanandan 2013). As with most other cetacean species, bycatch in drift gillnets is likely to occur in most countries of occurrence, but there is little information available on mortality rates.&#160; Bycaught animals are sometimes used as bait in fisheries (Mintzer <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>  <p>Melon-headed Whales are vulnerable to anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by naval sonar and bathymetric mapping with echosounders (Southall <em>et al.</em> 2013). Anomalous movement of Melon-headed Whales into a bay in Hawaii was associated with military sonar (Southall <em>et al</em>. 2006), and the frequency of mass stranding events for this species have increased in the last 30 years (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2006), especially in Japan (Amano <em>et al</em>. 2014). In 2008, a mass stranding event involving about 100 Melon-headed Whales, at least 75 of which died, occurred along the northwest coast of Madagascar. This was linked to the use of a high-power 12 kHz multi-beam echosounder system that was considered to have caused the stranding (Southall <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>  <p>Evidence from stranded individuals of several similar species indicated that they had swallowed discarded plastic items, which may have eventually led to their deaths (e.g. Lusher <em>et al. </em>2018). Off Japan, concentrations of PCBs, DDTs, and HCB in Melon-headed Whales have decreased during the 1980-2000 period, whereas PBDE and CHL levels showed a temporal increase (Kajiwara <em>et al. </em>2008). Individuals in both Hawaii and Japan had PCB concentrations at levels thought to be capable of causing toxic effects (Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2008; Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>","<p>Melon-headed Whales can be relatively common in some areas of their range, for example where deep water approaches islands, such as around the main Hawaiian Islands (Aschettino <em>et al.</em> 2012), in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (Dulau-Drouot <em>et al. </em>2008, Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010, 2011) and around some archipelagos in the western tropical Pacific (e.g. Marquesas Islands) (Gannier 2000; 2002). However, only a few abundance estimates are available.&#160; </p>  <p>In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the best available estimate is 2,235 individuals (CV=0.75) based on a summer 2009 survey covering the US EEZ seaward of the 200m isobath (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). Insufficient sightings in the western North Atlantic mean that it has not been possible to estimate abundance which however is very low (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2007). No other estimates are available for other tropical regions of the Atlantic.</p>  In the eastern tropical Pacific, based on large-scale surveys conducted between 1986 and 1990, 45,400 (CV=47%) Melon-headed Whales were estimated (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands EEZ resulted in abundance estimates of 2,947 (CV=1.17) in 2002 (Barlow 2006) and 2,860 (CV=1.04) in 2010 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2013). Mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data collected between 2002 and 2009 resulted in abundance estimates of 5,794 (CV=0.20) in the main Hawaiian Islands population and 447 (CV=0.12) in the Hawaiâi (Big Island) resident population (Aschettino 2010). In the eastern Sulu Sea and in the TaÃ±on Strait in the Philippines, 921 (CV=83%) and 1,383 (CV=82%) individuals, respectively, were estimated from line transect surveys conducted in 1994 and 1995 (Dolar <em>et al. </em>2006). In the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean, aerial surveys were conducted between December 2009 and April 2010, and allowed to generate abundance of small Globicephalinae (<em>Feresa attenuata</em> and <em>P. electra</em>) of which the majority of individuals are likely to be Melon-headed Whales (Laran <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the Mozambique Channel, abundance was estimated across three survey blocks; northern (97,598, CV=33%), central (24,360, CV=47%) and southern (9,581, CV=72%) (Laran <em>et al. </em>2017).",Unknown,"<p>Melon-headed Whales occur mainly in tropical and subtropical waters between 40Â°N and 35Â°S (Perryman and Danil 2018). A few extralimital strandings have been recorded in western Europe (England, France), Maryland (USA), central Japan, and Cape Province (South Africa) (Best &amp; Shaughnessy 1981; Perryman <em>et al</em>. 1994; Spitz <em>et al. </em>2011; Amano <em>et al</em>. 2014). Melon-headed Whales occur in deep oceanic waters, but are frequently associated with oceanic islands and archipelagoes (Brownell <em>et al. </em>2009). &#160;They are frequently encountered around the main Hawaiian Islands (Aschettino <em>et al</em>. 2012), western Indian Ocean islands such as La Reunion and the Comoros (Dulau-Drouot <em>et al. </em>2008, Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010, 2011), Timor-Leste in eastern Indonesia (Mustika 2006), and Palmyra in the central Pacific (Brownell <em>et al. </em>2009). In French Polynesia, they are relatively common around the Marquesas (Gannier 2002), but uncommon in the Society Islands (Gannier 2000). In the Wider Caribbean Region, they occur in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Mullin <em>et al. </em>1994) and in the Lesser Antilles, but are relatively uncommon (Watkins <em>et al. </em>1997, Yoshida <em>et al. </em>2010). &#160;They have not been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea&#160;or the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara e<em>t al</em>. 2017).<strong></strong></p>","<p>Melon-headed Whales are taken occasionally in small numbers by hunting directed at cetaceans in Japan, Saint Vincent, Taiwan, West Africa, and possibly elsewhere.

50369903,17027,Phocoena phocoena,Least Concern,,2020,2020-05-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p>Harbor Porpoises are found in temperate to sub-polar waters of the Northern Hemisphere in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Black Seas. They occur primarily in coastal and continental shelf waters. <br/><br/>Harbor Porpoises are bycaught often in fishing gear, especially gillnets, throughout their range and several populations are of conservation concern, including the Baltic Sea subpopulation which is classified as Critically Endangered (Hammond et al., 2016), and the Black Sea subspecies which is classified as Endangered (Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008). They are also subject to direct hunting in some areas, especially in Greenland. Other factors that likely affect the health of Harbor Porpoises include contaminants, noise, and prey depletion. Despite this, the species remains one of the most widespread and abundant cetaceans in the Northern Hemisphere, available estimates indicate that there are well over a million Harbor Porpoises globally, and there is no evidence that the threats are resulting in a continuing global population decline. This species was listed as Least Concern on the Red List in 2008 and it remains Least Concern in this updated assessment. Despite this, there are some populations, such as the Afro-Iberian Harbor Porpoise population, that are of conservation concern and may warrant separate subpopulation assessment. <br/><p></p>","<p>Harbor Porpoises mature earlier and have shorter gestation and lactation periods and life spans than most other cetaceans. Their normal reproductive cycle is annual.&#160; Throughout their range, Harbor Porpoises are largely limited to continental shelf waters. They typically frequent bays, estuaries, and tidal channels less than about 200 m in depth although in some areas, such as Greenland, they are found regularly beyond the 300m depth contour (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carretta <em>et al</em>. (2001) found that the main distribution of Harbor Porpoises in northern California was in waters shallower than 60 m deep. However, dives to at least 400 m have been recorded via telemetry (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/> <br/> Harbor Porpoises eat a wide variety of fishes and cephalopods, and the main prey items vary regionally (see Smith and Gaskin 1974, Recchia and Read 1989, Fontaine <em>et al</em>. 1994, Gonzales <em>et al</em>. 1994, Aarefjord <em>et al</em>. 1995, Gannon <em>et al</em>. 1998, Read, 1999, BÃ¸rjesson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2004, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).&#160; Although small schooling fish (e.g. herring) are important, demersal foraging is characteristic in many areas. &#160;In most areas of the North Atlantic, the diet is dominated by just a few prey species from six families (in terms of biomass): Gadidae, Clupeidae, Osmeridae, Ammodytidae, Gobiidae, Carangidae. In terms of prey numbers, other groups with small individual body size, notably gobies, assume more importance. Off the Iberian Peninsula where the continental shelf is narrow, pelagic and offshore species are more important than in most other areas.&#160; Dietary shifts have been seen when important prey have declined in abundance â and originally preferred prey species do not necessarily reappear in the diet of the porpoises when stocks recover. This tendency to switch prey and not revert to âidealâ prey once stocks recover, coupled with their high metabolic rate, makes Harbor Porpoises vulnerable to prey depletion (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).</p>  <p>Surveys in 1994, 2005 and 2016 in the North Sea and adjacent waters showed a shift in distribution from northern to southern areas (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2002, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017), a change that is reflected by increases in sightings from shore in countries like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Camphuysen 2004, Thomsen <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160; <br/> <br/> The ecology of Black Sea Harbor Porpoises may be unusual, reflecting the high degree of geographic isolation of their habitat, the low water salinity, seasonal fluctuations of water temperatures and large amounts of anoxic waters below 100-250 m (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Birkun 2010).<br/> <br/> <br/> </p>","<p><strong>Direct Catches</strong><br/> Harbor Porpoises have been hunted in many parts of their range, e.g. Puget Sound, Bay of Fundy, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Labrador, Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, Black Sea, and Danish Belt Seas (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). There is evidence that Harbor Porpoises were harvested by indigenous people in Maine (USA) and the Canadian Maritimes before the 1960s, and the meat was used for human consumption, oil, and fish bait. The extent of these past harvests is unknown, though it is believed to have been small and localized. Many of the above hunts are now closed but Harbor Porpoises are still hunted regularly in Greenland where both their meat and skin are consumed. The Greenland hunt is currently unregulated, however, catches do have to be reported. In Greenland more than 700 per year were taken in 1990-1993 (Teilmann and Dietz 1998). In 2003 the reported catch had increased to 2,320 (NAMMCO 2005). Catches increased between 1990 and 2017, up to an average annual harvest of approximately 2200 animals and a total of 55,495 individuals are estimated to have been killed between 1993 and 2017 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). These catch statistics may underestimate total mortality because there is a degree of under reporting and because an unknown proportion of animals killed may not be successfully secured by hunters. An annual total removal of 2,900 Harbor Porpoises allows for a 70% chance that the population will increase, but assessment of the population-level impacts of the hunt is hampered by unreliable reporting (NAMMCO 2019) and the sustainability of the current harvest level is questionable. Harbor Porpoises are also hunted and bycaught in the Faroes but quantitative data are lacking (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).</p>  <p>In Japan, there has never been a directed hunt for Harbor Porpoises. Differences in the local names used for cetacean species in Japan in the past mean that catches of other species may have been misreported as Harbor Porpoises (Kasuya 2017). In the Black Sea, large directed takes occurred during 1976-1983. Within that period, the total number of Harbor Porpoises killed was at least 163,000-211,000. Commercial hunting of Black Sea cetaceans, including Harbor Porpoises, was banned in 1966 in the former USSR (present Georgia, Russia and Ukraine), Bulgaria and Romania, and in 1983 in Turkey. Illegal direct killing of unknown numbers of Harbor Porpoises continued in some parts of the Black Sea until 1991 (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006; Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008).<br/> <br/> <strong>Fisheries Bycatch</strong><br/> Today, the most significant threat to this species in most areas is incidental catch in fishing gear, primarily gillnets. Substantial bycatch rates were documented in the 1980s and 1990s and are summarized in Donovan and BjÃ¸rge (1995). Mortality due to bycatch was estimated for the Gulf of Maine (1,200-2,900/year), Bay of Fundy (80-400/year), West Greenland (1,400/year), North Sea (4,600/year) Celtic Shelf (1,500/year), and also off central California (tens to hundreds per year; Barlow and Hanan 1995). </p>  <p>Bycatch in gillnet fisheries off the central coast of California were documented to cause high levels of mortality and population declines of Harbor Porpoises, with a peak in the 1980âs and a gradual subsequent decline when management measures, including fishery closures in some areas, were put in place to protect marine mammals (Barlow and Forney, 1994). Following implementation of these measures, surveys conducted in 1991-1993 did not indicate increases in populations (Forney, 1995), but increases were documented between 2002 and 2007 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2009). Bycatch in current fisheries off the Pacific coast of the USA does not appear to represent a population-level threat (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2018), with the exception of the salmon gillnet fisheries in southeast Alaksa, where annual mortality from bycatch was estimated at 34 individuals, exceeding the calculated potential biological removal limit of 8.9 individuals per year (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>In Japan, 83 bycatch deaths in set nets and bottom gillnets were reported during 2008-2017, most of them in Hokkaido. This number is likely to be only a small part of the actual mortality&#160;(Marine Mammals Strandings Database, National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, https://www.kahaku.go.jp/english/research/db/zoology/marmam/drift/detail.php?id=93). Annual incidental catches and deaths of Harbor Porpoises in the large set nets at Usujiri, Hokkaido during 1992-1997 were reported as <a style=""mso-comment-reference: RR_1;mso-comment-date:20191017T0946"">3.67 caught, and 0.17 dead per net</a>, respectively, because animals enter the nets but often either leave of their own accord or are released by fishers (Iwata <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although the mortality of animals per net is not large, considering that there are about 1,000 large set nets along the coast of Hokkaido, substantial incidental mortality is suspected. </p>  <p>Across the North Atlantic, gillnets, including bottom-set gillnets, tangle nets and drifting gillnets, are responsible for most of the Harbor Porpoise bycatch, and the data were recently reviewed by IMR/NAMMCO (2019). The fisheries responsible for the majority of Harbor Porpoise by-catch tend to be those using medium to large mesh-size gillnets set for species such as cod, hake, turbot, monkfish and lumpfish. The reason for the high by-catch rates in these fisheries is a combination of net type and fishing effort. The observed decrease in bycatch of Harbor Porpoises in some areas is most likely due to a reduction in fishing effort, which is in turn due to a reduction in total allowable catches of the target species.</p>  <p>Along the US Atlantic coast Harbor Porpoise bycatch in set gillnets was estimated as 2,900 individuals/year in the early 1990s. Rates remained near this level until implementation of Take Reduction Plans in December 1998 that included a series of time and area closures and gear modifications which saw bycatch rates drop to approximately 300-900 individuals/year (Orphanides 2009; IMR/NAMMCO 2019). After that, by-catch increased when compliance with rules related to the use of pingers decreased. Harbor Porpoises are still caught in the gillnet fisheries targeting monkfish and other groundfish on the east coast of the United States from North Carolina north along the continental shelf and into the Gulf of Maine (Orphanides, 2009). In the Gulf of Maine/Lower Bay of Fundy (Canada) the total annual average human-caused mortality and serious injury, estimated using observer data from U.S. fisheries in 2011-2015, was 307 Harbor Porpoises (CV=0.16) (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2018). The majority of this mortality was in the sink gillnet fishery.<br/><br/>The best Harbor Porpoise bycatch estimates for Newfoundland range from 862 (95% CI= 130-2,135) in 2001 to 2,228 (95% CI 315-5,223) in 2003 (Benjamins et al. 2007). Estimates for the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Scotian Shelf stratum range from 2,215 (95% CI= 1,151-3,662) in 2000 to 2,394 (95% CI= 1,440-3,348) in 2001 (Lesage <em>et al</em>. 2004). A preliminary estimate of 1,841 Harbor Porpoises a year is considered as an upper bound for the bycatch in cod gillnets in Iceland over the period 2013-2017 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). The bycatch rate averaged over a 10-year period for Norwegian coastal waters is approximately 2,300 animals/year (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). In 2017, the Harbor Porpoise was the second-most frequently reported cetacean species to strand on the French Atlantic coast (Bay of Biscay) (6.7% of 1211 stranded individuals) and the most frequently reported species on the French Channel coast (74.1% of 307 stranded individuals) (Dars et al. 2017). Recent monitoring of Danish set-net fisheries in the North Sea revealed an average of 5,591 Harbor Porpoises taken annually in the period 1987-2001 (Vinther and Larsen 2002, 2004), with a significant reduction in by-catch towards the end of the time series as a result of a decrease in fishing effort and fish landings. The north-western Iberian Peninsula is a productive fishing area, and has one of the highest rates of marine mammal strandings recorded in Europe. Harbor Porpoises comprised 7% of strandings in Galicia (LÃ³pez <em>et al</em>. 2002) and 13% of strandings in central-north Portugal (Ferreira 2007). Between 1990 and 2010, a total of 305 Harbor Porpoises were recorded as stranded along the north-western Iberian Peninsula and around 60% of these porpoises bore evidence of fisheries interactions. Preliminary data suggest that this would represent an annual human-caused mortality rate of 4.3-11% of the Iberian Harbor Porpoise population, which is very likely to be unsustainable (F. L. Read <em>et al</em>. 2020). The estimated average annual by-catch across Portuguese polyvalent, purse seine and beach seine fleets in 2010 to 2014 was 906 Harbor Porpoises (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).<br/></p>  <p>A study of cetaceans stranded in the Netherlands examined the gross pathology of 255 Harbor Porpoises and found that in the period 1990-2000, and in 2006 and 2007, between 50 and 60% of the animals showed signs of definite or probable by-catch in fishing gear. A study using remote electronic monitoring and logbooks to monitor bycatch in bottom-set gillnet fisheries in the Netherlands yielded an estimated average of 23 Harbor Porpoises (95% C.I. 2-44) caught per year between 2013 and 2017 â thought to represent between 0.05 and 0.07% of the Netherlandsâ Harbor Porpoise population (Scheidat <em>et al</em>. 2018). Evidence suggests that Harbor Porpoise lifespans are shortened in areas of high human activity and increased bycatch risk in the Baltic Sea (Kesselring<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>In the Black Sea incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets is estimated to have been in the thousands annually through the 1980s (e.g., Birkun 2002a). The scale of this mortality has almost certainly increased in recent times owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Black Sea (Tonay and ÃztÃ¼rk 2003; Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008).</p>  <p><strong>Other Threats<br/> </strong>Other types of threats to Harbor Porpoises include chemical pollution, vessel traffic, noise, and depletion of prey by overfishing. Due to their near-shore distribution, Harbor Porpoises are exposed to coastal sources of pollution throughout most of their range. Chemical pollutants (specifically PCBs) have been described as having adverse effects (Hammond<em> et al.</em> 2016). Immunosuppression by contaminants (heavy metals and PCBs) is reported in the eastern North Atlantic (Bennet <em>et al.</em> 2001, Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2005), and a similar cause was suggested for the high rate of infectious disease found in stranded Harbor Porpoises in Canada (Fenton <em>et al</em>. 2017). Following the EU-wide ban of commercial penta- and octa-mix polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) products in 2004 (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012), a significant (and consistent) decline was observed in concentrations of brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) in marine sentinel species (including the Harbor Porpoise) during the period 2008 to 2012 (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Declines were also observed in HBCD, tributyltin (TBT) and organochlorine pesticide concentrations in the blubber of UK-stranded Harbor Porpoises over the same period (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Concentrations of PCB, a known endocrine disruptor, in Harbor Porpoise blubber have remained stable since 1997, with mean Î£PCB concentrations in adult male and female porpoises (sampled between 1990 and 2012) exceeding an established mammalian toxicity threshold of 9 mg/kg Î£PCB for onset of physiological (immunological and reproductive) endpoints in marine mammals (Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2016, Kannan <em>et al.</em> 2000, Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Preliminary results suggest that reproductive dysfunction in UK porpoises, either through endocrine-disrupting effects or via immunosuppression and increased disease risk, is related to PCB exposure.<br/> <br/> Noise pollution in coastal waters is increasing, and seal scarers, which are powerful acoustic harassment devices designed to keep seals away from fish farms and fishing gear, are increasing in number. They are known to deter porpoises at distances of many kilometers, and likely more than 10 km (Johnston 2002, Mikkelsen <em>et al</em>. 2017, Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 2002). In almost all studies (in captivity and in the field) the reaction of porpoises to sounds has been negative (evasion).&#160; <br/> <br/> Habitat degradation and prey depletion caused by intensive fishing in the Black Sea, together with the explosive growth of populations of invasive species, are considered significant threats for Harbor Porpoises in this semi-enclosed sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Reduced prey availability coincided with two mass mortality events (in 1989 and 1990) that affected all three Black Sea cetacean species, but primarily Harbor Porpoises (Birkun 2002c). Severe pulmonary nematodosis, caused by <em>Halocercus spp</em>. and complicated by bacterial super-infection, was recognized as the proximate cause of the deaths, which were mainly of young animals.</p>  <p>An explosion at a gas-drilling platform in the Azov Sea in August 1982 resulted in the deaths of over 2,000 Harbor Porpoises (Birkun 2002b).&#160; </p>","<p>No synoptic surveys have covered the entire range of the species across ocean basins, but abundance has been estimated for many portions of the range. In the North Atlantic (including the Black and Azov seas), 18 assessment units have been proposed (IMR/NAMMCO 2019), and in the North Pacific, several population units or stocks have been identified based on genetic studies (Chivers <em>et al</em>. 2002, Taguchi <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p><u>Pacific Ocean</u><br/> Based on aerial or vessel surveys conducted between 2007-2013 corrected for availability bias, about 68,500 animals occur along the west coast of the USA (including 2,917 (CV=0.41) in the Morro Bay population, 3,715 (CV=0.51) in the Monterey Bay population, 9,886 (CV=0.51)] from San Francisco to the Russian River, 35,769 (CV=0.52) in northern California and southern Oregon, 21,487 (CV = 0.44) in Oregon and Washington , and 11,233 (CV=0.37) in Washington inland waters) (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p>Aerial line transect surveys conducted in summer 1998 and 1999 estimated (corrected for availability and perception bias) about 90,500 Harbor Porpoises (including 11,146 (CV=0.24) in coastal and inland waters of southeast Alaska, 31,046 (CV=0.21) in the Gulf of Alaska, and 48,215 (CV=0.22) in the Bering Sea) (Hobbs and Waite 2010, Muto <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using vessel-based line transect methods, from 2010-2012, there were estimated to be 975 (CV=0.1) Harbor Porpoises in inland waters of Southeast Alaska (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dalheim <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p><u>Atlantic Ocean</u><br/> A comprehensive review of the status of Harbor Porpoises in the entire Atlantic Ocean was conducted in 2018 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019), and compiled abundance estimates are available in the online supplementary files here: <a href=""https://nammco.no/topics/scientific-workshops-symposia-reports/#2018"">https://nammco.no/topics/scientific-workshops-symposia-reports/#2018</a> and summarized below.</p>  <p>In the western Atlantic, an abundance estimate of 79,883 (CV=0.32) Harbor Porpoises was generated from a shipboard and aerial survey of the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy in JuneâAugust 2011 (Palka 2012, Hayes <em>et al. </em>2018). This estimate is likely negatively biased because no correction was made for availability bias (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018). Aerial line transect surveys of the Atlantic coast of Canada in 2016 generated a Harbor Porpoise abundance estimate of 256,355 (CV=0.40), comprised of a Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) stratum with 48,723 individuals (95% CI= 23,566-100,754), a Gulf of St Lawrence stratum with 185,258 animals (95% CI=101,006-286,117), and a Scotian Shelf stratum with an estimate of 20,464 individuals (95% CI=6,831-37,317) (Lawson &amp; Gosselin 2018).&#160; </p>  <p>Abundance estimates for Harbor Porpoises in East and West Greenland were generated from aerial surveys conducted in 2007 (West Greenland only) and 2015 (West and East Greenland).

Aerial surveys in the Faroes in June 2010 estimated 5,175 (CV=0.44, 95% CI=3,457-17,637) Harbor Porpoises, however these surveys did not cover areas outside the 300 m depth contour and therefore this is considered a minimum estimate (Gilles <em>et al.</em> 2011, IMR/NAMMCO 2019). </p>  <p>Harbor Porpoises (along with Common Dolphins) were the most abundant cetaceans recorded during the SCANSIII survey program in July 2016 in the European Atlantic (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). The program estimated a total of 466,569 (CV=0.154, CI=345,306-630,417) Harbor Porpoises from aerial and ship surveys, which included 24,526 porpoises (CV=0.28, CL low=14,035, CL high=40,829) in Norwegian coastal waters, 24,370 (CV=0.23) in western Scotland, 53,336 (CV=0.24) in the Celtic and Irish Seas, 345,306 (CV=0.18) in the North Sea, 67,691 (CV=0.22) in the Kattegat/Belt Seas/Skagerrak area, and 2,898 (CV=0.32) around the Iberian Peninsula of Spain and Portugal (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017, Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2018). Ship-based line-transect surveys between 2002 and 2007 estimated Harbor Porpoise abundance in the Barents Sea as 55,394 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). Line transect aerial surveys conducted throughout the waters of the Netherlands from May 2008 to March 2010 generated an estimate of 66,328 porpoises (95% C.I. 32,745â125,220; CV=0.34) (Scheidat <em>et al</em>. 2012). No abundance estimates are available for Harbor Porpoises off Northwest Africa.</p>  <p><u>Baltic Sea</u><br/> Abundance of Harbor Porpoises in the Baltic Sea was estimated as 497 animals (95% CI=80-1091) based on two years (May 2011-Apr 2013) of static acoustic monitoring data collected at 304 survey stations (SAMBAH 2016). Aerial surveys were conducted during different seasons in the years 2002 to 2006 to obtain estimates of abundance in the southwestern Baltic. Abundance estimates for the total area ranged from 457 (CV=0.97) in March 2003 to a high of 4,610 (CV=0.35) in May 2005 (Scheidat <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p><u>Black Sea</u><br/> The results of line transect surveys conducted during the early 2000s in different portions of the Black Sea suggested that the total population of Harbor Porpoises was at least several thousand and perhaps as many as 10,000-12,000 (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Ongoing surveys mean that this estimate will be updated in the near future.</p>  <u>Global</u><br/> Taken together, these numbers indicate that the global abundance of Harbor Porpoises is well over a million individuals.",Unknown,"Harbour Porpoises are found in cold temperate to sub-polar waters of the Northern Hemisphere (Gaskin 1992, Read 1999). They are usually found in continental shelf waters, although they occasionally travel over deeper offshore waters. In the North Pacific, they range from central California and northern Honshu to the southern Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (including the Bering and Okhotsk Seas, and Sea of Japan). In the North Atlantic, they are found from the southeastern United States to southern Baffin Island (they apparently do not enter Hudson Bay) in the west, and from Senegal to Novaya Zemlya in the east. They also occur around southeast and western Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, and this is the only cetacean species that currently regularly occupies the Baltic Sea. The species occurs in the Black Sea, Marmara Sea, and Sea of Azov, but with the exception of the adjacent northern Aegean Sea, they do not regularly occur in the Mediterranean Sea.","<p>Most directed harvests of this species have now been closed, but they continue in Greenland (NAMMCO 2019).</p>",Marine,"<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES and Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). It is on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention, Appendix I of the Berne Convention and Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive. Harbor Porpoises are covered under ACCOBAMS (CMS Agreement for the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Areas) and are âmanagedâ by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO). The CMS 13th Conference of Parties (COP) in February 2020 adopted a Concerted Action for Baltic and Iberian Harbor Porpoise populations.</p>  <p>The introduction of fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, including time/area closures, off California and in inland waters of Washington State, effectively reduced Harbor Porpoise mortality and led to population increases over time (Forney 1995, Carretta et <em>al. </em>2009).</p>  <p>In the North Sea, bycatch (incidental mortality) has been determined to be above the advised maximum level of removals. The European Union adopted a regulation aimed at reducing the incidental catch of small cetaceans in fisheries in EU waters. The use of acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) has proven to be effective in reducing bycatch mortality for this species without negatively impacting target fish catches (CarlstrÃ¶m <em>et al</em>. 2009; Larsen and Eigaard 2014). As such, EU regulations require the use of pingers in some EU gillnet fisheries in the North and Baltic Seas, and the use of onboard observers to monitor bycatch on vessels of over 15 m in length. Recommended improvements to these measures and their implementation include better monitoring, data collection and management to more effectively assess and mitigate bycatch (Dolman<em> et al.</em> 2016), and the use of time area closures in conjunction with acoustic deterrents (Beest<em> et al.</em> 2017). Similarly, on the east coast of the USA, Harbor Porpoises have been the subject of Take Reduction Plans since 1998 that include time and area closures and gear modifications.&#160; </p>",Afrotropical|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is known from only a few tens of sightings and a few strandings, all in the southern hemisphere. There is no information on global abundance or trends in abundance for this species. The limited number of records suggests that they are not common, or they are distributed principally very far from land and difficult to detect and identify, or both of these (Mead 2018). Even in Australia and New Zealand where the majority of sightings have been made, the species appears to be rare (Donnelly <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Shepherdâs Beaked Whale was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008 and it remains extremely data-poor. The Red List Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) state that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DDâ. In this instance Critically Endangered (if it is rare and declining) and Least Concern (if it is common but largely undetected or misidentified) are both plausible categories and it therefore continues to be classified as Data Deficient. </p>","<p>This species generally lives far offshore, well away from coasts; however, where there is a narrow continental shelf, Shepherdâs Beaked Whales may sometimes occur in deep water close to shore. Information on this species is derived from a very limited number of verified sightings and a handful of strandings, therefore its <span lang=""EN-IE"">habitat preferences remain poorly understood (Donnelly <em>et al</em> 2018). Almost all sightings in Australia (n=12) and New Zealand (n=6) were in continental slope waters with depths exceeding 310 m. Mean depth of all sightings was 1,208 Â±871 m, and only one sighting (3,940 m) was recorded in waters deeper than 2,000 m (Donnelly <em>et al</em>. 2018).

It is rarely found close to mainland shores, except in submarine canyons or in areas where the continental shelf is narrow and coastal waters are deep (Heyning 1989, 2002) and is mostly a pelagic species that appears to be confined by the 10Â°C isotherm and the 1,000 m bathymetric contour (Houston 1991, Robineau and di Natale 1995).<br/> <br/> Like all beaked whales, Cuvier's Beaked Whales appear to prefer deep waters for feeding.

They appear to feed mostly on deep-sea squid, but also sometimes take fish and crustaceans (Heyning 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005). In the North Pacific West <em>et al.</em> (2017) noted fish in three of 16 stomachs examined, representing 12.1% of prey by mass overall. While five families of fish were documented, one species, <em>Albatrossia pectoralis,</em> made up 97% of the fish prey items documented. In addition, otoliths from the codling family Moridae were found in a specimen from South Africa (Sekiguchi 1994). They apparently feed both near the bottom and in the water column. As with other beaked whales, suction appears to be used to draw prey items into the mouth at close range (Heyning and Mead 1996).</p>","<p>Because of&#160;their offshore occurrence and tendency to feed on deep-sea squid, Cuvierâs&#160;Beaked Whales are probably little exposed to human activities that occur in coastal waters (tourism, many types of fisheries, etc.). However, the few studies carried out on this species highlight one main threat, which is certain forms of human caused underwater noise. This threat affects the species world-wide. Military sonars and possibly high-energy sounds from other anthropogenic sources have repeatedly resulted in the stranding and death of Cuvierâs Beaked Whales. Recent atypical mass strandings (AMSs) of Beaked Whales have been linked to high-powered naval sonar and seismic exploration (e.g., Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Deployment of military sonar has led to strandings of beaked whales suffering from chronic and acute tissue damage due to the <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly the result of decompression sickness (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al.</em> 2005). In particular, several AMSs of Cuvierâs Beaked Whales have been associated with naval activities in the Canary Islands, from the mid- to late-1980s until 2004 (Bernaldo de QuirÃ³s <em>et al</em>. 2019). In 2004 a moratorium on mid-frequency active sonar was established by the Spanish Government around the Canary Islands and there have not been any additional AMSs since. Another AMS event occurred in March 2000 in the Bahamas during a naval exercise (Rowles <em>et al</em>. 2000, Anon. 2001). A number of AMS events in the Mediterranean were consistent with naval activity in the region (PodestÃ  <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2016, CaÃ±adas and Notarbartolo 2018). Moore<em> et al</em>. (2018)<em> </em>also reported that AMSs were strongly correlated in locations (Japan, Puerto Rico and Italy) where US Naval fleets were based. Simonis<em> et al. </em>(2020) report that three of eight Cuvierâs Beaked Whale stranding events in the Mariana Archipelago (totaling 10-11 individuals) between 2006 and February 2019 occurred during or within six days after naval activities, and that this co-occurrence was highly significant. This study also highlighted that both single animal and mass stranding events may be sonar-associated. The US Navy is funding research to explore possible mitigation measures. Geophyical surveys which use airguns for oil and gas exploration are also of concern, particularly in the Mediterranean (PodestÃ  <em>et al</em>. 2016, CaÃ±adas and Notarbartolo 2018). A stranding of two Cuvierâs Beaked Whales in the Gulf of California was closely correlated with a seismic survey (Malakoff 2002).<em></em></p>  <p>Never a main target of commercial whalers, Cuvierâs Beaked Whales have sometimes been taken as bycatch in other directed fisheries, such as those in the Caribbean Islands, Indonesia, Taiwan, Peru, and Chile (Heyning 1989, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the Japanese <em>Berardius</em> fishery, Cuvierâs Beaked Whales were taken in the past on an opportunistic basis, with catches varying from 3 to 35 animals yearly (Omura <em>et al</em>. 1955). Although the <em>Berardius</em> fishery still continues, there have been no direct takes of Cuvierâs Beaked Whales for decades (Nishiwaki and Oguro 1972).</p>  <p>Bycatch of Cuvierâs Beaked Whales has been reported in several commercial fisheries. Julian and Beeson (1998) reported a mortality of 22-44 individuals per year in the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery from 1992 to 1995.&#160;The introduction of the use of pingers in the fishery in 1996 resulted in a complete cessation of bycatch in this fishery (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Willis and Baird (1998) noted one Cuvierâs Beaked Whale killed in a fishery for flying squid offshore of western Canada in 1986. Notarbartolo di Sciara (1990) reported on two Cuvier's Beaked Whales that were thought to have been killed in the Italian Swordfish (<em>Xiphius gladius</em>) fishery during 1986-1988. Bycatch in the western North Atlantic is very low, with one animal reported between 1994 and 1998 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cuvierâs Beaked Whales are occasionally taken incidentally in driftnets in the Mediterranean Sea. Prior to the driftnet ban of 2002, occasional bycatch in pelagic driftnets was reported from Spanish, French, and Italian waters (Banca Dati Italiana Spiaggiamenti 2015, PodestÃ  and Magnaghi 1989). But, there are also reports of entanglements after the ban. During the MED09 survey in the AlborÃ¡n Sea, a CuvierÂ´s Beaked Whale was found alive entangled in a driftnet, and two Moroccan driftnet fishing vessels were spotted a few miles away.&#160;</p>  <p>There are reports of ingestion of plastic debris by Cuvierâs Beaked Whales. Two stranded animals in Greece had stomachs with many pieces of plastic bags (A. Frantzis pers. comm., Frantzis 2009), as did a stranded animal in Croatia (Holcer <em>et al</em>. 2007. Other reports are described in GomerÄiÄ <em>et al</em>. (2006), and PodestÃ  and Meotti (1991). Poncelet <em>et al</em>. (1999) described a considerable amount of plastic debris in the stomach of a Cuvierâs Beaked Whale washed ashore on the French Atlantic coast. </p>  <p>Given their diet is primarily composed of deep-water squid, with smaller contributions of fish and crustaceans (West <em>et al</em>. 2017), there is relatively little competition with commercial fisheries (Arkhipkin <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Low levels of organochlorines were reported from Cuvierâs Beaked Whales from Hawaii and Bermuda (Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Knap and Jickells 1983). Low levels of flame retardant compounds were reported from this species (Law <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of beaked whales, mainly mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016) and is a potential health hazard of unknown significance. However, the residue levels in beaked whales are much lower than other small cetaceans (Cockcroft 1999). High concentrations of mercury, selenium and cadmium have been detected in animals sampled from the Ligurian Sea (Capelli <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em> </em>However, in all reported cases, organochlorine residues found in Southern Hemisphere small cetacean are lower than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (OâShea <em>et al. </em>1980, Reijnders <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect Cuvierâs Beaked Whales, although the nature of impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p><p></p>","<p>Determining abundance of Cuvierâs Beaked Whales is difficult for several reasons: 1) they are widely distributed in offshore waters of most of the worldâs oceans; 2) in areas where multiple species of beaked whales occur some sightings cannot be identified to species; 3) they regularly make long, deep dives and animals may be below the surface and not detected during surveys; and 4) the body size is relatively small and group size is often small making detection in rough offshore waters difficult even if the animals are at the surface.<em> </em>Global abundance of this species is unknown but there are estimates of numbers in some areas. </p>  <p>Wade and Gerrodette (1993) estimated an abundance of about 20,000 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.27) Cuvierâs Beaked Whales in the eastern tropical Pacific region (19 million km<sup>2</sup>), but a re-analysis of the same data increased the estimate to about 80,000 after accounting for diving animals that were missed (Ferguson and Barlow 2001). Barlow (2003) estimated Cuvierâs Beaked Whale abundance off the U.S. west coast from shipboard surveys as 8,311 (CV = 0.50) in 1991-1993, 1,876 (CV = 0.81) in 1996, and 1,892 (CV =1.08) in 2001. A survey of that same region in 2014 yielded an abundance estimate of 3,775 (CV = 0.68) (Barlow 2016). A trend analysis of all data from surveys conducted during 1991-2014 estimated the number of Cuvierâs Beaked Whales in this region as 3,928 (CV = 0.67) in 2014, with evidence of a decline in abundance over the study period that occurred mostly between 1993 and 1996 (Moore and Barlow 2013).</p>  <p>Shipboard surveys of the Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding the Hawaiian Islands in 2002, 2010 and 2017 produced abundance estimates of 1,216 (CV=0.77), 338 (CV=1.01) and 4,431 (CV=0.41) in the three years, respectively (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2020). Cuvierâs Beaked Whales were the most abundant beaked whale of the three species documented in two of the three years (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2020). Using photoidentification data, Baird (2016) estimated that 52 animals used the west side of Hawaii Island over a four-year study period.</p>  <p>Waring <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported results of shipboard and aerial surveys conducted in 2011 in the western North Atlantic from the lower Bay of Fundy to central Florida and estimated 6,532 (CV = 0.32) Cuvierâs Beaked Whales in the survey area, but these estimates were not corrected to account for those individuals that were diving.<strong> </strong>In an area of 15,765 km<sup>2</sup> off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, McLellan et al. (2018) estimated between 50 (95% CI 30-80) and 90 (95% CI 110-380) Cuvierâs Beaked Whales, depending on the assumptions used regarding surfacing synchronicity. In summer 2009, surveys dedicated to estimating cetacean abundance were conducted in offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico resulting in an abundance estimate for Cuvierâs Beaked Whales of 74 (CV = 1.04). The estimate for unidentified beaked whales was also 74 (CV = 1.04), and may have also included an unknown number of Cuvierâs Beaked Whales (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). CaÃ±adas <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated 2,286 (CV = 0.49) Cuvierâs Beaked Whales in the European Atlantic based on ship-based surveys conducted during 2005-2009. This estimate was adjusted for unidentified beaked whales but not for diving. PodestÃ  <em>et al.</em> (2016) estimated that about 100 individuals are found in the northern Ligurian Sea. Using photo-identification off El Hierro in the Canary Islands, Reyes SuÃ¡rez (2017) estimated 87 (95% CI 73-103) or 84 (95% CI 70-101) individuals over a six-year period.</p>  <p>Cuvierâs Beaked Whales are undoubtedly among the most common and abundant of all the beaked whales, and worldwide abundance is likely to be well over 100,000. There is no information on trends in abundance for any population. except off the west coast of the United States (Moore and Barlow 2013). This is the only widely-distributed beaked whale species for which a global assessment of genetic diversity has been conducted. The results of that study suggest that there is probably little movement of Cuvierâs Beaked Whales among ocean basins (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2005). Substantial variation in morphology has been recorded across the range of the Cuvierâs Beaked Whale (Heyning 1989), which suggests the existence of local subpopulations including one in the Mediterranean Sea (CaÃ±adas and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2018). In areas where satellite tagging and/or photoidentification studies have been undertaken (e.g., Hawaii, North Carolina, Ligurian Sea, Canary Islands), limited movements and strong site fidelity has been documented, suggesting substantial subpopulation structure (Baird 2019, Foley <em>et al</em>. in review, PodestÃ  <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reyes SuÃ¡rez 2018).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Cuvier's Beaked Whales have the most extensive range of any beaked whale species (Heyning 1989, 2002, Baird 2018). They are widely distributed in offshore waters of all oceans, from the tropics to the polar regions, in both hemispheres. Their range covers most marine waters of the world, with the exception of shallow areas and very high-latitude polar regions. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas, such as the Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk (but not in the Baltic,Black or Red Seas). This is the only species of beaked whale regularly found in the Mediterranean Sea (PodestÃ &#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). South of the Antarctic Convergence (60Â°S) they are uncommon (Branch and Butterworth 2001).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The Cuvierâs Beaked Whale was hunted at a low, and largely opportunistic, level. Nishiwaki and Oguro (1972) reported that 189 Cuvierâs Beaked Whales were caught at coastal whaling station in Japan during 1965-1970 and that such operations had diminished in later years.

The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.â Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and across a substantial swath of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere and the western North Pacific. Therefore, it is not rare (see Supplement for definitions), therefore the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied and the species does not belong in the DD category.</p>    This species is not rare and it appears to be fairly common in at least some parts of its large range (see Supplement for definitions), which spans parts of both the Pacific and Indian Oceans.&#160; Longmanâs Beaked Whales are vulnerable to low-level threats in a substantial portion of their range. However, well-documented threats (especially anthropogenic noise) are not significant in much of the range. &#160;In addition, the large range allows the potential to contain demographically independent populations that could buffer overall risk to the species. &#160;Plausible categories are NT or LC.&#160; Least Concern is the more appropriate category since the species is fairly common in parts of its large range and subpopulations (demographically independent populations) may exist (see Supplement).","<p>Little is known about the biology of this species.&#160; Live sightings come from scattered locations, mainly in deep, oceanic waters in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, in areas with surface water temperatures of 21-31Â°C. Dive times of up to 33 min have been recorded (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). School sizes tend to be large and may vary regionally: reported mean school sizes range from 7.2 (western Indian Ocean) to 29.2 (western Pacific), with individual groups ranging from 1-100 individuals (Pitman <em>et al</em>. 1999, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160; Stomach contents of single animals stranded in Japan (Yatabe <em>et al</em>. 2010) and the Philippines (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2012) contained beaks of various mid-water squids.</p>","<p>Little specific information is available on threats to Longmanâs Beaked Whales. </p>  <p>Although there has never been a directed fishery for them, pervasive gillnet and longline fisheries throughout their range raise concern that at least some bycatch occurs, as is true for other beaked whales (e.g., Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Sri Lanka, for example, there is evidence of occasional incidental or directed takes of animals identified as Southern Bottlenose Whales (<em>Hyperoodon planifrons</em>, Dayaratne and Joseph 1993), which in retrospect were most likely Longmanâs Beaked Whales (Anderson et al. 2006, Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2009). Even low levels of human-caused mortality might be unsustainable for populations of this naturally uncommon species. <br/> <br/> In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;Two Longmanâs Beaked Whales (possibly a mother and calf) stranded alive in Taiwan coincident with naval training exercises in the area; at least one of these individuals had lesions consistent with gas embolism (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2008). </p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). Two Longmanâs beaked whales examined had plastic in their stomachs (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 2012) and another may have died from ingesting plastic bags (Kaladharan <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in various species of mesoplodonts (Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Kajiwara<em> et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016), including&#160; this species (Bachman <em>et al</em>. 2014), but the potential health hazard is of unknown significance. </p>  <p>All beaked whales normally live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some possible cases have been reported (Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2004, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>  <p>Morbilliviruses became recognized as pathogens in marine mammals in the late 1980s (Van Bressem et al. 2014). Infection was first confirmed in Longmanâs Beaked Whale in 2010 from a stranding in Hawaii (West <em>et al</em>. 2013), and this disease syndrome may have contributed to a mass stranding in New Caledonia (Garrigue <em>et al.</em> 2016). The prevalence and potential impact of morbillivirus on this species is not currently known.<br/> <br/> Predicted effects of global climate change on the marine environment may affect Longmanâs Beaked Whales although the nature and severity of impacts are unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>","<p>There is no information on trends in the global abundance of this species.

They are among the more commonly studied cetaceans in the Indian Ocean, especially in Shark Bay, Western Australia. However, information on distribution, population size, and trends in abundance and mortality from much of the speciesâ range is still very limited. As they are primarily coastal, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins often co-occur with fisheries, and bycatch is a major cause of concern for this species. Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are also at risk from high levels of noise and chemical pollution, industrial activity such as oil and gas development, and habitat reduction caused by land reclamation and coastal development (Curry and Smith 1997, Wells and Scott 1999, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003, Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2008). Furthermore, survey data suggest that Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in relatively small populations or communities with limited geographic ranges, especially where they reside close to islands (KrÃ¼tzen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Natoli <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Fury <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, SÃ¤rnblad <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2018), which can exacerbate the impact of human activities and demographic stochasticity on this species. </p>  <p>Estimates of abundance from populations for which information on bycatch is also available indicate that human-caused mortality is frequently unsustainable (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em><em> </em>1992, Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2012, Preen 2004). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Based on the sum of existing abundance estimates, the total population size for the species over its entire range is likely well in excess of 40,000 individuals. Large parts of the range have never been surveyed (e.g. much of the Arabian Sea, Arabian/Persian Gulf, Pakistan, India, Red Sea, Somalia, Yemen, Mozambique, Indonesia, Philippines).</p>  <p>The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin was classified as Data Deficient in 2008. The species distribution overlaps the range of several other coastal cetacean species that are red-listed as Endangered (Irrawaddy Dolphin <em>Orcaella brevirostris</em> and Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa plumbea</em>) or Vulnerable (Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa chinensis</em> and Australian Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa sahulensis, </em>Australian Snubfin Dolphin<em> Orcaella heinsohni</em> and the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise <em>Neophocaena phocaenoides</em>) and are subject to the same anthropogenic threats. However, compared to these other species, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is assumed to be under less immediate threat because it has a wider geographic range and probably larger numbers, greater behavioural plasticity and broader habitat preferences. Data are insufficient to present a robust case for listing the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin in a threatened category (CR, EN, or VU). However, its coastal distribution, inferred local declines, and intensity of threats throughout its range lead to the conclusion that Least Concern is not an appropriate category.</p>  <p>The Red List Guidelines (version 11, 2014) state that âthe category Near Threatened is applied to taxa that do not qualify as threatened now, but may be close to qualifying as threatened, and to taxa that do not currently meet the criteria for a threatened category, but are likely to do so if ongoing conservation actions abate or cease.â Also, to qualify for Near Threatened, the taxon âshould be close to qualifying for the Vulnerable category; estimates of population size or habitat should be close to the Vulnerable thresholds, especially when there is a high degree of uncertainty, or possibly meet some of the subcriteria; and this may be combined with biological susceptibility and threat.â Considering the above, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is listed as Near Threatened because: 1) it occurs in a relatively small and restricted near-shore range<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, 2) it is highly vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and its range overlaps with intensive fisheries known to entangle and kill dolphins, 3) its near-shore habitat is subject to increasing anthropogenic threats resulting in habitat loss and degradation, and 4) it is experiencing mortality rates that are likely to be causing population declines in several areas. The species therefore comes close to meeting criterion A4 for Vulnerable. Population size is inferred and suspected to have declined by close to 30% throughout the range of the species, over three generations and in a time period encompassing the past, present and future. The causes of the reduction (gillnet entanglement and coastal habitat degradation) have not ceased. Generation length for Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, according to Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007), is 21.1 years, therefore three generations is 63.3 years. Thus, an annual decline of around 0.5% would result in exceeding the 30% decline in 3 generations. Gillnet fisheries and coastal development are increasing throughout the range of the species and bycatch is anticipated to remain stable or to increase in the future without urgent and intensive efforts which are unlikely to be forthcoming.</span></p>  <p>It is important to emphasize that numerous isolated populations of this species would likely qualify as threatened subpopulations, particularly those found around island groups in the Indian Ocean.</p>","<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins generally occur over shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf or around oceanic islands. In some locations, they occur relatively far from shore, but in the shallow waters of reef banks (Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2012). In comparison to other areas, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins off the coast of Bangladesh occur in relatively deep offshore waters at the head of the Swatch-of-No-Ground submarine canyon where they were detected at an average depth of 202m (SD=112, range=45-395) (Smith and Mansur 2013). In the Clarence River estuary and Richmond River estuary in northern New South Wales, Australia, dolphin distribution varied according to season and tidal state (Fury <em>et al.</em> 2008). Along the coast of Adelaide, South Australia, dolphins occur in shallow nearshore areas and temperate reefs in summer, shallow nearshore areas in autumn and deep waters further offshore in winter (Zanardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Coffin Bay, Thorny Passage Marine Park, South Australia, dolphins showed no distinct seasonal shifts in distribution patterns and areas of high probability of dolphin occurrence were located mainly within the inner area of Coffin Bay, associated with shallow waters (2â4âm and 7â10âm) and located within 1km of land (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2018a). Strong site fidelity and restricted ranging patterns are characteristic of some populations (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2018b).</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins sometimes occur in mixed groups with Common Bottlenose Dolphins, Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa plumbea</em>), spinner dolphins (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>), Australian humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) and possibly other delphinids (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015; Koper and PlÃ¶n&#160;2016). They feed on a wide variety of schooling, demersal and reef fishes, as well as cephalopods (Ross 1984; Amir <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2005; Yamazaki <em>et al.</em> 2008). In some locations, large predatory reef fishes can represent an important proportion of their diet (Belonidae and Carangidae), such as around the island of Mayotte, in the SW Indian Ocean (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2014). Group size is generally less than 30 (see Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, for a review), but in South Africa mean group size in Algoa Bay is 76, and groups of up to 600 individuals are commonly observed (Bouveroux <em>et al.</em> 2018, Melly <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>Bycatch is the dominant threat affecting Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins throughout their range. However, there are very few estimates of mortality rates or abundance over time to evaluate the severity of the impact. In Australia, the major threats include bycatch in trawls and gillnets as well as in shark nets set at popular coastal beaches to protect bathers (Hale 1997, Paterson, 1990). A total of 15 Bottlenose Dolphins (species unknown) were confirmed to have died from net entanglement in southern blue-fin tuna feedlots between 1994 and 2000 (Kemper and Gibbs 2001). Research by Mintzer <em>et al.</em> (2018) into the global use of cetaceans as bait in fisheries reported that this practice is much more widespread within Taiwanese fisheries than is presently recorded. From 1974 to 1986, the Taiwanese shark and tuna gillnet fishery exploited the waters off northern Australia, including the Arafua and Timor Seas and was responsible for the incidental catch of a variety of small cetaceans, with <em>Tursiops </em>spp<em>. </em>likely<em> aduncus</em> comprising 60% of the total cetacean catch (Harwood &amp; Hembree 1987). The annual mortality of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins may have exceeded 2,000 animalsâseverely impacting local population[s] (Young and Iudicello, 2007). As a result of this bycatch, the fishery was closed in 1986 (Young and Iudicello, <a style=""mso-comment-reference:GB_3;mso-comment-date:20190614T1311;mso-comment-parent: 1""></a><a style=""mso-comment-reference:GB_2;mso-comment-date:20190614T1310; mso-comment-parent:1""></a><a style=""mso-comment-reference:LU_1;mso-comment-date: 20190603T0957"">2007</a>). </p>  <p>Off western Kyushu, Japan, mortality of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in bottom-set gillnets was estimated at 12-14 individuals per year, which was considered unsustainable for the local population thought to number only somewhat more than 200 individuals (Shirakihara &amp; Shirakihara 2012). Photo-identification data collected off the coast of Bangladesh indicated that 28.2% of identified individuals had injuries related to entanglement gear (Mansur <em>et al.</em> 2012), and similar methods used in the coastal waters of Mayotte (Comoros archipelago, Mozambique Channel) showed that 19% of identified individuals bore signs of non-lethal interactions with coastal artisanal fisheries (Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2008). In Bangladesh, between August 2016 and April 2018, 31 small-scale gillnet fishing vessels participating in a Citizen Science Fishermen Safety Network reported fatal entanglements of 14 dolphins and porpoises, of which seven were Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, during 177 fishing trips (Wildlife Conservation Society 2018). Off the island of Zanzibar (Tanzania), 43 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin captures in artisanal drift gillnets were reported from 1995 to 1999. The magnitude and population-level impact of gillnet bycatch in Zanzibar was assessed in 2003-2004, and it was found that annual bycatch rates were unsustainable as they represented 9.3% of the estimated local population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Amir 2010). Bycatch was also evaluated recently in drift gillnets off Zanzibar using landing data (Temple <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2019), and there are reports of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin mortality in coastal artisanal fisheries off mainland Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique (Kiszka 2015, Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2009). Bycaught dolphins are often used as bait in longline fisheries targeting sharks (Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2018, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, an average of 34 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins per year were accidentally killed by bather protection nets around beaches between 1981 and 1989 (Cockroft 1990). This increased to an average of 45/year from 1990-1999, and from 2000-2009 the estimate was 27/year (Cliff &amp; Dudley 2011). In general, catches have steadily declined since the 1980âs due to better management of nets and the replacement of some shark nets (gillnets) with drumlines (baited hooks) in recent years (PlÃ¶n, unpublished). However, the majority of bycaught animals are immature individuals and mature females, raising concern about population-level impacts (PlÃ¶n, unpublished). In most areas limited data on bycatch or a lack of information on population size mean that it is not possible to determine whether annual catch rates are sustainable or not. However, the strong overlap in gillnet fishing effort and the coastal distribution of this species, combined with fairly small population sizes in many areas that have been surveyed, suggest that fishery bycatch is sufficiently high to cause population declines in many places.</p>  <p>The speciesâ near-shore distribution makes it vulnerable to environmental degradation, direct exploitation, and fishery conflicts (Curry and Smith 1997, Wells and Scott 1999; Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). Until hunting was outlawed in 1990, <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> was the target of a large-scale drive fishery in Taiwanâs Penghu Islands. Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in southern Japan and due to confusion with the commonly hunted Common Bottlenose Dolphin it is not clear whether they were ever specifically targeted by Japanese coastal cetacean fisheries in the past (Kasuya 2017). Some Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are taken in the small cetacean fisheries in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997) and Indonesia (Mustika 2006). Socio-ecological interview surveys in southwest Madagascar in 1999 indicated extensive hunting of coastal dolphins by Anakao fishermen of the Vezo community (Andrianarivelo, 2001). Dolphin species most often taken were the Spinner Dolphin, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin and Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin. Vezo fishers hunted coastal dolphins for local consumption and sale of meat (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Andrianarivelo (2001) estimated that over 6,000 individual dolphins, predominantly <em>Stenella</em> spp. and <em>Tursiops</em> spp. were taken in drive hunts between 1985 and 1999 from a single village, Anakao, and there was a substantial increase in catches evident during 1995â1999 accounting for 57% of all catches (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2009). The trend suggested an increase in intensity of hunting and impact on populations, likely associated with a change in hunting technique (from harpoons to nets) in the mid to late 1980s, and depletion of other food resources (e.g. decrease in fish populations), and subsequent increased adoption of cetacean hunting and consumption throughout the 1990s (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Subsequent interview surveys conducted between 2010-2013 demonstrated continuing high levels of both hunting and by-catch reported for <em>Tursiops</em> spp. along the entire west coast of Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were one of the most common species targeted by a drive-hunt in Zanzibar that stopped in 1996 (Berggren <em>et al.</em> 2007, Stensland and Berggren 2007). Anecdotal evidence suggests that several species of delphinids are hunted in the Seychelles (despite national prohibition), including Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Kiszka 2015). Although illegal, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were recorded as hunted in a harpoon fishery in southern Myanmar with six carcasses documented as being sold in March 2006 at the Maungmagan market (Tint Tun 2006). This species is one of the more common small cetaceans that are used as bait to catch sharks. There is no current evidence of traditional use/trade for consumption or medicinal use across the species range in Australia although it may have happened in the past. </p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the cetacean species most commonly kept in captivity in Asia (Wang <em>et al.</em> 1999, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). Since the early 1960s, live-captures of <em>T. aduncus</em> for oceanarium display have occurred in many areas, including South Africa, Australia, Taiwan, Japan and Java (Best and Ross 1984, Tasâan and Leatherwood 1984, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1994, Cawthorn and Gaskin 1984, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984). In 1974, 58 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were captured from Amami Oshima, Japan, for the Okinawa Expo and the aquarium which held them became the Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 1984). In 2003, a live-capture export trade was initiated in the Solomon Islands and a minimum of 108 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were exported between 2003 and 2011 to Mexico, UAE, China, the Philippines and Singapore (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2013; Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2010). This level of removals from the local population(s) is probably unsustainable (Reeves &amp; Brownell 2009). In the mid 2000âs in Australia, 32 Bottlenose Dolphins, including both <em>T. aduncus </em>and <em>T</em>. <em>truncatus</em>, were held at Sea World, Surfers Paradise, Queensland, and four <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> were kept at Pet Porpoise Pool, Coffs Harbour, New South Wales (International Species Information System 2009). In China in 2014, 39 captive facilities housed 491 cetaceans, most of them<em> Tursiops</em> spp. most from Japan and not <em>T. aduncus</em> (Chinese Cetacean Alliance 2015). Twenty-three Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are held at Ocean Park in Hong Kong, and one in Sea World, Durban (<a href=""http://www.species360.org/"">www.Species360.org</a>, reported March-2019). </p>  <p>In South Africa, of the six dolphin species (n = 90) incidentally captured in shark net installations or stranded off the east and south coasts between 2005 and 2009, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins had the second highest levels of persistent organochlorines and approximately half of adult <em>T. aduncus</em> had PCB concentrations above the previously determined threshold (17,000 ng g<sup>â1</sup> lw) for impairment of immune functions in aquatic mammals (Kannan <em>et al.</em> 2000; Gui <em>et al.</em> 2016); however it is important to note that other small cetaceans often report levels much higher than this. Despite this, systematic health assessments conducted on animals incidentally caught in shark nets between 2010 and 2012 indicated that Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were generally in good health (Lane <em>et al.</em>, 2014). In Zanzibar, levels of organochlorine pesticides in Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were lower than those reported from other regions, but methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ether levels were higher (Mwevura <em>et al.</em> 2010). Along the coast of La RÃ©union, DDTs, PCBs, and methoxylated-PBDEs were commonly found in blubber tissues of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Dirtu <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2016). However, concentrations were low compared to other locations, including Zanzibar (Mwevura <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p>Several diseases appear to be increasing in occurrence in coastal small cetaceans, raising concern for the health of these animals. Since the early 2000s, there have been several dolphin mortality events in Australia that have included <em>T. aduncus</em> (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2016). In these events all the dolphins tested positive for the cetacean morbillivirus. &#160;There are reports of a lobomycosis-like disease and other poor skin conditions in Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins from Mayotte and Japan which is a concern for these locally restricted populations (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009, Van Bressem <em>et al.</em> 2013, Tajima <em>et al.</em> 2015). The etiology of the disease was not established, but it may be related to the degradation of their coastal habitat (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009). The bacterial pathogen of the genus <em>Brucella</em>&#160;has also been reported from Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. Forty of 58 serum samples from <em>T. aduncus</em> from the Solomon Islands tested positive for antibodies to <em>Brucella</em> (Tachibana <em>et al.</em> 2006). This pathogen in dolphins can be a severe disease and cause abortions, male infertility, neurobrucellosis, cardiopathies, bone and skin lesions and death (Moreno&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;</p>  <p>Climate change, especially increases in sea surface temperature that are prevalent throughout coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, are negatively affecting coastal habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass beds used by Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. For example, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, an unprecedented marine heatwave in 2011 caused catastrophic losses of seagrass meadows along with mass mortality in invertebrate and fish communities. Long-term demographic data on Shark Bayâs resident Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin population revealed a significant decline in female reproductive rates following the heatwave (Wild <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the species most commonly targeted by dolphin-watching operators in the Indo-Pacific region and in some places where regulation is poor, the animals are harassed. Although dolphin-watching tourism is certainly not a threat to the species as a whole, changes in dolphin behavior have been observed in areas with intense dolphin-watching activity off Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, Japan (Matsuda <em>et al.</em> 2011) and in Menai Bay, Zanzibar (Christiansen <em>et al.</em> 2010) and around Mauritius (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2014). In Shark Bay, Western Australia, an increase in dolphin tourism coincided with a 14.9% decline in local dolphin abundance (95% CI=â20.8 to â8.23) (Bejder <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>The disturbance caused by marine construction and demolition, port development, reclamation, dredging, and other forms of habitat destruction and degradation, together with associated anthropogenic noise, is hard to quantify, but such activities and processes are widespread throughout the coastal range of this species. Individually and cumulatively, they may be causing population declines through increased mortality, impaired health, and/or reduced reproductive fitness as well as by habitat displacement.</p>","<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the best-studied species of small cetaceans in the Indian Ocean and in the western South Pacific (Solomon Islands). Although estimates of abundance (detailed below) are available for many local areas, the majority of their range has yet to be surveyed.&#160; Some available estimates are imprecise, lacking in sufficient details to evaluate their accuracy and context, and/or were generated sufficiently long ago (e.g. 20+ years ago) that, with increases in fishing intensity and coastal development, the present situation could be much different. In most locations studied, population sizes are small, typically in the low hundreds of individuals or fewer (&lt;100)<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. Exceptions include an estimate of between 1,700-2,200 individuals generated from data collected in 2005-2009 in Bangladesh, which represents an unknown portion of a larger super-population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins that extends farther west into un-surveyed waters in India; 2,000-3,000 dolphins documented to occur in Shark Bay, Western Australia; and a large population in the Algoa Bay region, South Africa estimated at about 28,000 individuals from data collected in the late 1990s (see details below).</p>  <p>In Australian waters, estimates of local populations indicate that this species is common mainly in inshore and nearshore waters. However, further genetic work is required to better define the distribution of the species, especially with regard to the taxonomic identity of particular populations to either <em>T. aduncus</em> or <em>T. truncatus</em>. Abundance estimates from surveys carried out between 2003 and 2006 for the Clarence River and Richmond River estuaries in northern New South Wales, were 71 (62â81 95% CI) and 34 (19â 49 95% CI), respectively (Fury <em>et al.</em> 2008). &#160;Abundance estimates in Jervis Bay ranged from 61 Â±3.2 in summer 1998/99 to 108 Â±7.1 in summer 1997/98, and from 143 Â±8.1 in summer 1999/00 to 160 Â±8.1 in summer 1998/99 in Port Stephens (MÃ¶ller <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Moreton Bay, Queensland, a population size of 554-622 (95% CI: 510â598) was estimated from boat-based surveys in 2008-2010 (Ansmann <em>et al.</em> 2013), with a further 700 to 1,000 individuals believed to occur off Point Lookout in 1998-99 (Chilvers and Corkeron&#160;2003). In southern Australia, where Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are those identified as â<em>T. australis</em>â (Charlton-Robb, 2011), resident populations of 80â100 animals occur in Port Phillip Bay and 50-150 in the Gippsland Lakes (unpublished data cited in Charlton-Robb <em>et al.</em> 2015). Local population estimates for South Australia indicated that approximately 74 resident Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins inhabited the Port River estuary and Barker Inlet, Gulf St Vincent (Steiner and Bossley 2008). From 1989 to 2005, between 95 (SE Â±45.20) and 239 (SE Â±54.91) individuals occurred in Adelaideâs coastal waters in winter 2013 and summer 2014, respectively (Zanardo <em>et al.</em> 2016), and 306 (95% CI: 291â323) occurred in Coffin Bay between September 2013 and October 2015 (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Abundance estimates of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins, (likely to be the putative species ""<em>T. australis</em>"" based on their coastal distribution and small group size), was estimated&#160;using double-observer platform aerial surveys over an area of 42,438 km<sup>2</sup> within two gulfs of South Australia.&#160; A total of 3,493 (CV = 0.21; 95% CI = 2,327-5,244) individuals were estimated in summer/autumn, and 3,213 (CV = 0.20; 95% CI = 2,151-4,801) in winter/spring of 2011 (Bilgmann <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;&#160;A population of 63 (95% CI = 59 to 73) to 185 (95% CI = 171â200) Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins was estimated off Bunbury, Western Australia, during winter 2007 and in summer 2010, respectively (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sprogis <em>et al.</em>, 2016). In coastal and estuarine waters near Perth, Western Australia, total estimated abundances in the Swan Canning Riverpark estuary, Gage Roads, and Cockburn Sound/Owen Anchorage between June 2011 and May 2015 were 16, 172, and 103, respectively (Chabanne <em>et al.</em> 2017). Aerial surveys in 1989 and 1994 indicated that a population of 2,000-3,000 dolphins occurred in Shark Bay, Western Australia, most being Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Preen <em>et al.</em> 1997). In North Western Australia, 157 (95% CI: 137â186) individuals were estimated to inhabit Beagle Bay and 35 (27â48) to 60 (42â87) Cygnet Bay in 2012â2013 (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Darwin Harbor and two neighboring sites, Northern Territory, abundance estimates ranged from 20 (95% CI 17 to 23) in October/November 2013 to 38 (95% CI 28 to 47) in October 2012 (Brooks <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Between 1994 and 2001, a total of 169 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were identified off Mikura Island, Japan (Kogi <em>et al.</em> 2004), and 216 individuals (CV=2.1%) were estimated off Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, western Kyushu, Japan, in 2008 (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2012). Approximately 1,000 km south of Tokyo an estimated 200-300 animals occur around the main Ogasawara Islands (Mori 2005). In the Swatch-of-No-Ground (SoNG) submarine canyon, off the coast of Bangladesh, mark-resight abundance estimates generated for 2005-2009 were 1,701 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1,533â1,888), 1,927 (95% CI = 1,851â2,006), 2,150 (95% CI = 1,906â2,425), and 2,239 (95% CI = 1,985â2,524) individuals (Mansur <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, abundance comparisons from two aerial surveys conducted in 1986 and 1999 in the southern-western area suggested an overall decline of 71% of small cetaceans over 13 years, where <em>T. aduncus</em> is estimated to account for 71% of the overall assemblage of dolphin species (Preen 2004). Surveys of Abu Dhabi waters conducted in 2014-2015 (55 boat-based surveys, 5,592 km of on effort transects) yielded an estimate of 1,834 (95% CI = 1,176-3,124) individuals (DÃ­az LÃ³pez and Methion 2016). Surveys of Dubai waters conducted in 2014 (56 boat-based surveys and 220 hours of effort) resulted in 8 sightings and 92 individuals being identified (A. Natoli, unpublished data).</p>  <p>In East Africa and around some islands of the western Indian Ocean, several abundance estimates are available. Between 1999 and 2002 off southwest Zanzibar, Tanzania the smallest estimate of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin abundance was 136 in 2001 (95%CI = 124-172) and the largest was 179 animals (95% CI = 167-212) in 2002 (Stensland <em>et al.</em> 2006). In southern Kenya, a population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins was estimated using mark-recapture as ranging from 19 individuals (95% CI: 11â33) to a maximum of 104 dolphins (95% CI: 78â139) (PÃ©rez-Jorge <em>et al.</em> 2016) based on photo-identification data collected between 2006 and 2009. Off the southwest coast of Mauritius, a resident population of <em>T. aduncus </em>was estimated to number &lt;100 individuals based on surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010 (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2014). Off the coast of Pemba in Tanzania, another small resident population was estimated to number 83 (CV 7.8%, 95% CI 72-97) individuals (Kasuga <em>et al.</em> in review) and off the island of Mayotte abundance was estimated from closed population models at 82 Â±19 SE individuals from data collected between 2004 and 2009 (Pusineri <em>et al.</em> 2014). Along the coast of La RÃ©union, an abundance of 72 (SE=6.17, 95%CI = 61-85) was estimated based on photo-identification data collected along the west coast from 2009 to 2014 (Dulau <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2017).</p>  <p>In South Africa, there appear to be both coastal (with mostly small group sizes) and migratory (with large group sizes) populations of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, but the boundaries between these are not well defined (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the number of individuals in the area between the Tugela River and Durban was estimated at 520 (160â970, 95% CI) in 1989 (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em><em> </em>1992). A maximum of 350 individuals was estimated in the area between Durban and Ramsgate (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em> 1991). Overall, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in the KZN area are likely fragmented into several populations (Natoli <em>et al.</em>, 2008). A migratory population in southeastern South Africa is estimated at more than 2,000 individuals and is characterized by large groups of hundreds of individuals (Natoli <em>et al.</em> 2008). An estimate of 28,482 (95% CI = 16,220â40,744; CV = 0.22) based on field work conducted in the mid 1990âs was calculated using POPAN mark-recapture analysis of photo-identified individuals in the Algoa Bay region of the Eastern Cape (<a name=""_Hlk3288225"">Reisinger and Karczmarski </a>2010). Due to the very low number of recaptures (131 out of 1,569 total captures), the estimation models fit the data poorly, which means that the point estimate, as well as the 95% CI, may not be accurate; however, the large number of identified individuals and small number of recaptures confirms that there was a sizeable population of this species in the wider Algoa Bay region at that time. Group sizes of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in Algoa Bay are consistently large for this species, being reported as typically ranging from 200-600 individuals (Ross 1982; Melly <em>et al.</em> 2017; Bouveroux <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is important to note that with intensifying fisheries and coastal development, the relatively favorable status of these dolphins in Algoa Bay could be very different now, 20+ years after the data used to generate the estimate by Reisinger and Karczmarski (2010) were collected.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins have a discontinuous distribution in warm-temperate and tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. They are found primarily in shallow coastal and estuarine waters and in shallow reef complexes (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species occurs from Australia in the east, throughout southeast Asia (including the Malay Archipelago and Cocos [Keeling] Islands) (Tom Jefferson pers. comm.), China (north to the Korean Peninsula) and southwestern Japan) and around the northern Indian Ocean rim (including in the Red Sea and Arabian/Persian Gulf) to the western range limit in eastern South Africa (Wells and Scott 2002, MÃ¶ller and Beheregaray 2001, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins also occur in the coastal waters of many oceanic islands distant from major land masses including the Maldives (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2012), the Andamans (Malakar <em>et al.</em> 2015), New Caledonia (Borsa 2006), the Comoros and Mayotte (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2012), the Solomon Islands (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2015), La RÃ©union (Dulau-Drouot <em>et al.</em> 2008), Mauritius (Webster <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2014) and the Seychelles (Kiszka<em> </em>2015).</p>","<p>It is harvested for food in some places, and for international trade as display animals.</p>",Marine,"Specific conservation actions for this species are lacking from most of  the range of the species although they are generally legally protected  in most range states. Due to increasing pressure of dolphin watching  tourism in Mayotte, specific measures prohibiting swimming with this  species have been implemented. In Australia dolphin watching is  regulated and there are National Whale and Dolphin Watching Guidelines  in place. In other parts of the species range where there are dolphin  watching or swim-with-dolphins tourism these are either unregulated, or  there has been some effort to manage or regulate the activities but  guidelines are not followed. This species occurs in numerous Marine  Protected Areas (MPAs) throughout their range but these are usually  designed with a focus on other marine species and not specifically to  include key habitat for Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. <br/><br/>The  exception to this is an MPA declared by the Government of Bangladesh in  2014 covering 1,700 kmÂ² which encompasses almost all Bottlenose Dolphin  sightings made during intensive cetacean surveys of coastal waters in  Bangladesh between 2004 to 2019. Efforts are still underway to establish  conservation management in this MPA. One promising approach for  reducing Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin bycatch in Bangladesh is an  initiative that requires gillnet fishermen to attend their nets, release  entangled dolphins, and collect data from mortalities in exchange for  capacity building to improve their safety at sea.<br/>Various strategies  have been tested to mitigate the unintentional catch of dolphins in  coastal bather protection nets in South Africa. Devices have been added  to the nets to make the nets more conspicuous acoustically (for example,  air-filled floats, clangers), or to deter the dolphins with sounds  (such as pingers), but these were not successful (Cliff and Dudley  2011). In the past decade, some gillnets have been replaced with baited  hooks (called drumlines) which have lower dolphin bycatch (Cliff and  Dudley 2011). <br/><br/>In Australia bycatch action plans for several  fisheries were introduced in 2001 to reduce the bycatch of dolphins and  other marine animals and these actions are managed by the Australian  Fisheries Management Authority.

Another recent decline of approximately 70% in a large part of the speciesâ range (Yellow Sea, Korea) provides an index of decline (subcriterion b) that may apply throughout many unsurveyed portions of the range. Although the rate of decline in such areas can only be inferred, there is no evidence that threats differ substantially. The scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (45 years; Moore 2015) (A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4). The factor most responsible for such decline is incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d), but the loss and degradation of habitat (including chemical pollution; subcriteria c and e) and vessel strikes (at least in the Yangtze River system; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013) are contributing factors as well. The primary causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population sizeâbycatch in fishing gear and mortality from vessel strikes (both interpreted here as âexploitationâ), decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollutionâhave not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.<br/><br/>As the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission concluded after a review of the species (at the time with no recognized species-level distinction between <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) in 2005 (IWC 2006), âhuman populations adjacent to the Finless Porpoiseâs habitat are increasing in size and becoming more industrialised so the expectation should be that anthropogenic pressures will continue and intensify.â None of the threats has been seriously addressed or mitigated in any part of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoiseâs range, even though threat levels are likely increasing. Partly because of their small size, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994). Incidental mortality in fishing gear is either known or presumed to occur throughout the range of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, IWC 2006).<br/><br/>There is clear evidence of a declining trend in three major parts of this speciesâ range. In the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, a decline of nearly 70% was estimated over a period of 22 years, from 1976-1978 to 1999-2000 (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002, also see Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). There is also evidence of a rapid decline in recent decades in the Yangtze River and adjoining lake systems of China (Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2008, Wang 2009, Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2012) with a 60% decline in the six years between 2006 and 2012 (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2014); the subspecies there (<em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em>) was classified as Endangered in 1996 and uplisted to Critically Endangered in 2013 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2013). Finally, there is recent evidence suggesting a decline of approximately 70% in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in the Korean portion of the Yellow Sea between the early 2000s and 2011 (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015), and there is no reason to believe this decline has been reversed.<br/><br/>There is sufficient information for separate assessment of at least two threatened subpopulations â the subpopulation in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, which likely qualifies for Endangered or Critically Endangered (Hashimoto et al. 2015), and the Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Japan) subpopulation, which likely qualifies for at least Vulnerable (Hashimoto et al. 2015).<br/><p></p>","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, possibly mangrove swamps, estuaries, and some large rivers. However, they can also occur in shallow waters (&lt;200 m deep) quite far from shore (up to 240 km). They appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In Japanese waters, Finless Porpoises prefer shallow depths (&lt;50 m) and close proximity to the shore (&lt;5 km). In the shallow East China Sea, proximity to the shore does not appear to be as important (Amano 2009). </p>  Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range.</p>  <p>In Japan, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises become entangled in a variety of types of fishing gear (Amano 2009). Changes in fishing methods and the use of acoustic deterrents may have reduced the incidental catch in some areas such as western Kyushu (Kasuya 1999, Amano <em>et al.</em> 2017), but substantial numbers are still being taken in gillnets and other fishing gear. A total of 114 specimens were collected in Japan during 1985â1992 from western and north-eastern Kyushu including parts of the western Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 1993): 84 (73%) of them had been killed incidentally in fisheries, 25 had been found dead on the beach or in the sea, and there was no information on the other five. Fishing gears that killed the 84 porpoises were bottom-set gillnets (58), surface gillnets (17), trap nets (7), trawl nets (1) and drifting (ghost) nets (1). Such fishing gears are common in Japan and probably kill Finless Porpoises off other coasts, although usually such catches go unreported. Shirakihara and Shirakihara (2013) estimated 238-270 Finless Porpoises are bycaught annually in Ariake Sound and Tachibana Bay.</p>  <p>In Korea (information is available only from the Republic of Korea), an official reporting system implemented in 2011 resulted in a count of 2,107 Finless Porpoises bycaught inshore, mainly along the west coast, in 2012 (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although reporting apparently has improved, there is still assumed to be substantial under-reporting for the following reasons according to Park <em>et al</em>. (2015): âFirst, each Finless Porpoise caught in a fishÂ­ing net costs approximately $100 (100,000 Wons) [<em>sic</em>]. Therefore, the dead porpoise can be discarded because it has no signifiÂ­cant value. Second, the bycatch of Finless Porpoises is usually reported only in large harbours, with deaths in smaller ports seldom reported (Kim <em>et al</em>., 2013). Therefore, it is likely that the impact of the bycatch of Finless Porpoises on its population is underestimated.â</p>  <p>Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the waters of western Taiwan, including the Matsu and Chinmen Islands (western Taiwan Strait), a considerable number of Finless Porpoises are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters (e.g., Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999), there are serious concerns about the level of bycatch of both Finless Porpoise species. Illegal electric fishing became widespread in the Yangtze River during the 1990s, and it may kill porpoises outright and certainly contributes to the depletion of their prey (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2000).</p>  <p>In some parts of their range, there is an aversion to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data). However, there is a long history of porpoises taken incidentally being sold for human consumption in at least some parts of Japan (e.g., Mizue <em>et al.</em> 1965) and on the Korean peninsula (IWC 2000). According to M. Amano (pers. comm.), consumption of Finless Porpoises no longer occurs in Japan. An analysis of the species composition of odontocete products in Korean markets during 2003â2004 estimated that the true catch of Finless Porpoises in Korean waters during this period was probably about four times the officially reported catch of 142 animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/> <br/> As coastal and riverine animals, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming and rampant harbour (and other) development throughout East Asia means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Porpoise habitat in the Yangtze River system has been degraded by water development, including the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams and about 1,300 smaller dams in tributaries (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2000). Sand mining is intensive in Poyang Lake, until recently a stronghold for Yangtze Finless Porpoises (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). Sand mining is also thought to have played a significant role in the severe decline of Finless Porpoises in the central and eastern Seto Inland Sea, Japan (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Kannan <em>et al</em>. 1989, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1995; Le <em>et al</em>. 1999, Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). A mass die-off of at least 249 Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises along the Saemangeum dike area of the western Korean Peninsula was reported by Park <em>et al.</em> (2012) who speculated that the cause was unusually low temperatures. However, there have been news reports of large (&gt;100) kills of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in local coastal fisheries, so it may be difficult to rule out human activities as a causal factor in such large-scale die-offs.</p>  <p>A survey of levels and drivers of human-caused mortality carried out in 27 fishing settlements along the middle-lower Yangtze channel identified three main categories of observed porpoise deaths: (1) interaction with fishing gear, (2) vessel strikes, and (3) unknown cause (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013). A total of 344 dated porpoise mortality events directly observed by informants between 1950 and 2008 were reported, including 75 porpoise deaths from 1989â1998 and 147 from 1999â2008. This apparent increase was said to be driven by the greater number of deaths attributed to vessel strikes (19 to 35) and unknown causes (31 to 94) in the more recent decade. Comparison of the reported mortality with the estimated abundance suggests that the fraction of individuals removed from the declining porpoise population in the Yangtze had quadrupled over the course of two decades. Turvey <em>et al</em>. concluded that entanglement in rolling hook long-lines was probably responsible for the greatest number of porpoise deaths in fishing gear and that vessel strikes and other anthropogenic factors, such as electrofishing, had become the dominant and increasing causes of mortality in the Yangtze.</p>  The causes of an apparent decline in Finless Porpoise numbers in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan are not fully understood, but include incidental mortality in fisheries as well as various forms of habitat degradation (IWC 2000, 2006). Parts of the coastal regions of the Inland Sea are highly developed and industrialized, so the associated threats of habitat loss (e.g., from reclamation and sand mining) and pollution are suspected to have had some (undetermined) level of impact (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 2002).","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (IWC 2006). Estimates from the early 2000s are available for five subpopulations in Japanese waters, distinguished on the basis of skull morphology and mtDNA variability (Yoshida <em>et al.</em> 1995, Yoshida 2002), as follows: 3,807 (coefficient of variation (CV) 16%) in Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 289 (CV 19%) in Omura Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 3,743 (CV 24%) in Ise/Mikawa Bay (Yoshida 2002); 3,387 (CV 33%) in Chiba/Sendai Bay (Amano <em>et al</em>. 2003); and 7,572 (CV 17%) in the Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Most of the estimates were summarized in IWC (2006). For the Inland Sea subpopulation, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. (2002) recorded a decline in sighting rate of 18-100% for 18 tracklines surveyed in 1976â78 and again in 1999â2000. The declines for 11 of the tracklines were statistically significant. Using abundance indices calculated by multiplying the density indices (no. individuals/cruise distance) and area size of each stratum, an overall decline of 69% is inferred over the 22 years between the two sets of surveys (T. Kasuya pers. comm. 2007, data from Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/> <br/> Surveys in western Korean waters (Yellow Sea) in the early 2000s estimated 21,532 (CV 39%) Finless Porpoises in offshore waters and 5,464 (CV 20%) in inshore waters (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) considered these estimates to be negatively biased (IWC 2006). More recent surveys resulted in density estimates of 0.122 individuals/km<span class=""A78"">Â² (offshore) and 0.151 ind./kmÂ² (inshore), both much lower than the corresponding estimates from surveys in 2004 (offshore, 0.565 ind./kmÂ²) and 2005 (inshore, 0.638 ind./kmÂ²) (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015). Park <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that these results indicated a decline in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in this region of approximately 70% between 2004/2005 and 2011.<br/> <br/> Based on surveys from 1984 to 1991, Zhang <em>et al</em>. (1993) estimated that there were about 2,700 porpoises in the Yangtze River, while Zhou <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated that only 700 remained in the lower reaches between Nanjing and Hukou between 1989 and 1992. Wang <em>et al</em>. (2000) concluded that Finless Porpoise abundance in the Yangtze River had declined considerably and that there could be fewer than 2,000 animals (although this was not based on a rigorous assessment). A two-vessel survey of the Yangtze mainstem in 2006 yielded an estimate of 1,225 (CV 0.13) which, when combined with earlier estimates for Poyang and Dongting Lakes, was interpreted as implying an overall number of about 1,800 in the Yangtze system (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). In some portions of the river where porpoises had been reported to be present in the past, none were seen during the 2006 survey (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2012). Previous estimates of the annual rate of decline of Yangtze Finless Porpoises varied from 5 to 7.3% (see Wang 2009 for a review). However, a survey of the mainstem Yangtze in 2012 determined that only approximately 500 porpoises remained (Mei <em>et al.</em> 2014), indicating a roughly 60% decline in the main river in six years. However, Yangtze River cetacean surveys have been plagued by variable methods and coverage, and therefore decline rates must be viewed with some level of caution.<br/> <br/> There are no abundance estimates for Finless Porpoises in Chinese marine waters other than Hong Kong (IWC 2006), which in any event refer to for <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and not <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The type specimen was from the Yangtze River, Kiangsu [=Jiangsu] Province, China, ~129 km (80 miles) northwest of Shanghai (Pilleri and Gihr 1972).<br/> <br/> In general, this species occurs in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal water around the western Pacific Ocean from the Taiwan Strait to the waters of northern China, Korea and northern Honshu, Japan. (Note that a Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise was discovered recently in the waters of Okinawa Island, Japan (Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010), but it probably represents an extralimital stray rather than an extension of the speciesâ range.) The distribution also includes a few estuaries and rivers (e.g., the <em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em> subspecies appears to be found exclusively in the Yangtze River system; Gao 1991, Gao and Zhou 1995).

50383813,41759,Mesoplodon perrini,Endangered,C2a(ii),2020,2020-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Perrinâs Beaked Whale is known only from six stranding records, all from the coast of California; there are no confirmed at-sea sightings. It can be inferred from the distribution of strandings that the species has a restricted distribution in warm-temperate waters of the Eastern North Pacific off California and may also occur to the south in the waters off Baja California, Mexico, based on (as yet unconfirmed) acoustic detections. This is a small distribution when compared with other beaked whales and is the smallest known range of any species in this poorly known genus. The 1991â2014 abundance estimate for pooled <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (which are not readily distinguishable at sea) across the known range of <em>M. perrini</em> is 1,164 (691, CV=0.59 for Southern California plus 473 (CV=0.86) for Central California) (Table 7 in Barlow 2016). Given the occurrence of several other <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. in the area, this abundance estimate represents an upper bound for <em>M. perrini</em>. The small range of <em>M. perrini</em> overlaps significantly with naval testing ranges off California, where active mid-frequency sonar, known to be implicated in strandings of <em>Mesoplodon</em> species and other beaked whales, is used. Mesoplodonts are also known to be subject to bycatch in drift nets, and to plastics ingestion. An inferred continuing decline is therefore considered probable. Given that the mature population size (which for cetaceans is in the range 35-75% of the total population size; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) is below 2,500, the species qualifies as Endangered under criterion C2a(ii). Because the abundance used is pooled over several species, it is also plausible that this species may qualify as Critically Endangered (CR) with fewer than 250 mature individuals. </p>","<p>Almost nothing is known about the biology of this species. Although there have been no confirmed live sightings, it is assumed that, like all other members of the genus, Perrinâs Beaked Whale occupies oceanic waters beyond the shelfbreak and is a deep diver. A stomach from a stranded Perrinâs Beaked Whale contained two beaks from the squid <em>Octopoteuthis deletron</em>; another contained a single squid eye lens (Mead 1981).</p>","<p>Little specific information is available on anthropogenic threats to Perrinâs Beaked Whale (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>Although there has never been a directed hunt for this species, drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts are known to become entangled and drown&#160; (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009). Entanglement of beaked whales has apparently been eliminated in drift gillnets off California through use of pingers (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, gillnet use without pingers continues off Mexico and even low levels of bycatch could have a significant impact on this apparently rare mesoplodont.<br/><br/>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active mid-frequency sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause of these strandings is often unknown, but some stranded individuals have been found to be suffering from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness linked to disturbance by naval sonar (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005). Given that a large fraction of the known distribution of Perrinâs Beaked Whale falls within US Navy testing ranges off California, this could represent the most significant threat to the species.<br/><br/>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality of cetaceans, especially beaked whales, including mesoplodonts (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Macroplastic items can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and they represent a potential health hazard of unknown significance to Perrinâs Beaked Whales.<br/><br/>Mesoplodonts are small whales that normally live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some possible cases have been reported (Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2004, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Predicted effects of global climate change on the marine environment may have impacts on this species, although the nature of such impacts is unknown at this time (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Although none of the above factors may represent an existential threat to this species, the cumulative impact could account for the likely decline in this apparently very rare species.</p>","<p>There are no confirmed sightings of live Perrinâs Beaked Whales and no specific estimate of abundance. Regular ship surveys (approximately one every four years) were conducted in the area adjacent to all the known stranding sites for this species, from the coast out to 250-300 nm offshore, from 1991 to 2014, but hardly any of the mesoplodont sightings were identified to species. Pooling the data from these surveys, Barlow (2016) estimated the total abundance of <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. where <em>M. perrini</em> is known to occur as 691 in the southern California stratum and 473 in the central California stratum. Strandings from the adjacent coastline suggest that at least six species of <em>Mesoplodon</em> could be included in these estimates:&#160;<em>M. carlhubbsi</em>, <em>M. perrini</em>, <em>M. peruvianus</em>, <em>M. densirostris</em>, <em>M. stejnegeri</em>, and <em>M. ginkgodens.</em> <em>Mesoplodon perrini </em>is the only species in this group that has not been recorded outside of the survey area. Therefore, the pooled estimate from these two strata (1,164, CV=0.49) provides an upper bound for the abundance of <em>M. perrini</em>.<br/><br/>An analysis of the abundance trend from 1991 to 2014 for <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. in the entire survey area off the entire US west coast (between Canadian and Mexican border) yielded wide confidence limits (95% CRI -10 to +18% p.a.; Moore and Barlow 2017), with too few sightings to estimate the trend by stratum. Previously, Moore and Barlow (2013) had estimated, using data from 1991 to 2008, a trend of -8.4% p.a. (95% CRI -18.9 to +0.3% p.a.) and thus an almost certain decline. However, 2014 was an anomalously warm-water year (<em>e.g</em>. Bond <em>et al</em>. 2015), with many warm-water marine species being recorded far north of their usual ranges, including <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. peruvianus</em>. Moore and Barlow (2017) hypothesize that the apparent increase in the abundance of <em>Mesoplodon</em> species in 2014 was likely caused by a shift in distribution of warmer-water species, <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. peruvianus</em> which are also more common than the displaced <em>M. carlhubbsi</em> and <em>M. stejnegeri,</em> into the area rather than a real population increase. Therefore, the long-term trend of <em>M. perrini</em> cannot be quantified at this time, but a probable continuing decline is inferred from the threats documented below.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The six specimens currently known to science all stranded between southern and central California (33â37Â°N). These are the five records reported by Dalebout <em>et al.</em> (2002) from southern California, and a stranding that occurred in Monterey, California in 1997. See the Supplementary Information for a map showing stranding locations. It appears that this species is endemic to the eastern North Pacific Ocean off the California coast in warm-temperate waters and probably south into Mexican waters. Initially, two sightings of mesoplodonts off California in the 1970s were tentatively identified as <em>M. hectori</em> (Mead 1981); it was later suggested that these were <em>M. perrini</em> (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2002), but there is no confirming evidence for either identification.<br/><br/>Acoustic data may provide additional information on the geographic range of <em>M. perrini.</em> A unique beaked whale echolocation pulse (called BW43) has been described from seafloor recording instruments off southern and central California up to 350 nmi offshore (Baumann-Pickering <em>et al.</em> 2014). Based on the restricted range of this sound which, at that time, did not extend beyond the suspected range of <em>M. perrini</em>, Baumann-Pickering <em>et al</em>. (2014) proposed that <em>M. perrini</em> was the most likely source of that sound. More recently, a study with drifting buoy recorders found a concentration of BW43 echolocation pulses off northern Baja California, Mexico (Simonis <em>et al.</em>, 2020).

Even low levels of bycatch could have a significant impact on this species.</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as those from active sonar and seismic survey operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005). </p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018).

Partly because of their small size, which limits their strength to break free once entangled, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994), and incidental mortality in fishing gear has been documented throughout the range of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises. Fishing effort with gear documented to catch Finless Porpoises accidentally (including gillnets, trawls, stow nets, and seines) is intense in many areas where the species occurs or occurred. Although not quantified as rigorously as for some <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> populations, regional declines (and possible local extirpations) of <em>N. phocaenoides</em> have been reported, presumably due to a combination of fishing pressure, coastal development and industrialization, pollution, and heavy vessel traffic (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2005, Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/> <br/>The data are insufficient to make a rigorous quantitative assessment of population trend for this species in any part of its range, but the scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 30% over the last three generations (about 45 years, assuming 15 years/generation as estimated for <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> by Moore 2015) (<a name=""_Hlk486670028"">A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4)</a>. The factor most responsible for such a decline would be incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d, âexploitationâ), but the loss and degradation of habitat (subcriterion c) and pollution (chemical and acoustic; subcriterion e) are likely contributing factors as well. None of the threats has been seriously addressed in any part of the speciesâ range, even though threat levels are presumably increasing.<br/> <br/> Therefore, the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise qualifies for Vulnerable under Red List criteria A2cde, <a name=""_Hlk486670084"">A3cde, and A4cde, </a>considering that the causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population sizeâbycatch, decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollutionâhave not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.","<p>Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. They occur in waters &lt; 200 m deep and can be sighted up to 240 km from shore in some areas. It is uncertain which of the two currently recognized species of Finless Porpoises (possibly both) occurs farther offshore, especially in areas of sympatry.</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).</p>  <p>Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004). <br/></p>  Higher numbers of Finless Porpoises are present in Hong Kong waters in winter and spring than in other seasons (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Seasonal differences in density and distribution, with higher densities in the winter months of November to January, have been observed along the coast of southern Maharashtra, India, and acoustic monitoring data from there have been interpreted to suggest both seasonal and diurnal patterns of occurrence in near-shore waters (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017). Minton <em>et al</em>. (2013) also observed a seasonal signal in their vessel surveys in Kuching Bay, with higher densities of Finless Porpoises observed in March, April, and May, which coincided with the occurrence of larger groups containing very small calves. Observations of porpoise behaviour in the bay were interpreted as suggesting that it is an important feeding and calving area (Zulkifli Poh 2013). Two stranded individuals had large shrimp in their stomachs (G. Minton, pers. comm., cited in IWC 2017).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002b). Finless Porpoises are caught in nets in Iranian, Indian, Pakistani and Malaysian coastal waters, although there are no good estimates of the magnitude of such catches (e.g., see Collins <em>et al.</em> 2005, Jaaman <em>et al</em>. 2009, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2010). In East Malaysia, Finless Porpoises are caught as bycatch in âfish stakesâ in Sabah (Jaaman <em>et al.</em> 2009) and one individual was found entangled in the line of a crab trap in Sarawak (G. Minton pers. comm. 2011), where cetacean bycatch is prevalent (Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016, IWC 2017). Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the Taiwan Strait (where the two species of Finless Porpoises are sympatric), a considerable number of both species are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). In Hong Kong waters, porpoises are caught regularly by trawl nets and gillnets, but there are no estimates of bycatch levels (Parsons and Jefferson 2000, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2002b). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters, the apparently high bycatch of Finless Porpoises (Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999) is a serious concern. In Maharashtra, India, during 2014-2016, at least twenty Finless Porpoise carcasses washed ashore, a few of them known to have drowned in shore seine nets and gillnets (M. Sule, pers. comm<em>.</em>).</p>  <p>As a coastal species, the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise is also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming, causeways, and harbour (and other) development throughout Asia (including the Persian/Arabian Gulf) means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003, Braulik<em> et al. </em>2010). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, Parsons and Chan 1998, Minh <em>et al</em>. 1999, Parsons 1999, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002b, Ramu <em>et al.</em> 2005). The number of reported Finless Porpoise strandings in Hong Kong has increased in recent years, partly due to increasing public awareness and reporting of local cetaceans, but also possibly due to escalating levels of human impacts (T.A. Jefferson pers. comm. 2017). In the Persian/Arabian Gulf, chemicals from recent wars exacerbate total pollution loads in coastal waters from the usual sources such as industry, agriculture and households (Braulik <em>et al. </em>2010). Vessel collisions, especially involving high-speed ferries, may be a particular problem for porpoises in Hong Kong (Parsons and Jefferson 2000).</p>  <p>The following summary of examples illustrates the problems faced by this species:</p>  <p></p><p>In Chinese waters (excluding the considerable fisheries operating in Taiwanese waters), more than 3.5 million gillnets were estimated to be in use in the early 1990s (Zhou and Wang 1994). In India, the use of gillnets reportedly had increased from about 18,000 in 1950 to more than 216,000 by 1980 and gillnets were also being used extensively in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar (Mohan 1994). Since the time of those reports, gillnetting effort certainly would have increased considerably in these and other regions because there are few (if any) restrictions on this kind of fishing gear anywhere in the range of the species. Porpoise habitat in Myanmar is heavily fished with gillnets and other types of gear capable of taking small cetaceans incidentally (Smith and Than Tun 2008). A drift gillnet fishery for elasmobranchs is of concern in the Bangladesh Sundarbans (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008). In East Malaysia, Finless Porpoise numbers are thought to have âgreatly declinedâ due to bycatch in fisheries (Jaaman <em>et al. </em>2009), and commercial fishing (gillnetting, trawling, purse-seining) is intensive off Peninsular Malaysia where bycatch of Finless Porpoises is known to occur even though it is not monitored regularly (L. Ponnampalam pers. comm. August 2017). Surveys in the coastal waters of Vietnam have resulted in very few sightings of cetaceans. In a study by Smith <em>et al.</em> (1997), no sightings were made of Finless Porpoises yet local whale temples contained many skulls of them as well as other cetacean species. A survey around Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam, in 2015 found evidence of Finless Porpoises being bycaught in trawl nets (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm., August 2017). The impacts of war in the 1960s and 1970s, compounded by intense fishing (especially the use of gillnets) in recent years and ongoing, are likely at least partly responsible for the near absence of cetaceans from these waters. In Iran (Persian/Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman/Sea of Oman), bycatch in fisheries appears to be the greatest threat to marine mammals and removals from apparently small, localized populations of Finless Porpoises may be unsustainable (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2010). Two major marine mammal die-offs occurred in the Persian/Arabian Gulf in the 1980s and 1990s, possibly related to major oil spills (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2005). Finless Porpoise sightings in Pakistanâs Indus Delta region were apparently decreasing in the 1970s (Pilleri and Gihr 1972, Pilleri and Pilleri 1979) and by the 1990s the species had nearly disappeared from this badly degraded area (see Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1997). </p>  <p>The Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise is one of several cetacean species that have greatly declined or disappeared from large parts of their range in Thailand, largely as a result of coastal habitat degradation and fishery bycatch (IWC 1994). </p>  No large-scale direct hunting of this species is known to occur. In some parts of their range, people apparently are averse to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data) but in other areas they are consumed. Direct killing or capture of Finless Porpoises appears to be relatively rare (Reeves <em>et al. </em>1997) but development of intentional fisheries for marine mammals from incidental captures (and economic benefits from subsequent consumption and marketing) may have increased in parts of Southeast Asia as preferred marine resources have been over-fished (see Perrin 2002).","<p>Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (Jefferson and Hung 2004, IWC 2006), mostly in regions where the Narrow-ridged species (<em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) dominates, if not exists solely. Numbers of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises in Hong Kong and adjacent waters were estimated to be at least 217 (coefficient of variation (CV) 21-150%) (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002a).</p>  <p>A vessel line-transect estimate of Finless Porpoises in Kuching Bay, Sarawak, Malaysia was 135 individuals (CV 31%, 95% confidence interval 74-246) (Minton <em>et al.</em> 2013). This represents a relatively small part of the speciesâ overall range (known or predicted) in western Borneo; there are no published abundance estimates for nearby areas (IWC 2017). A preliminary estimate of &gt;1,000 from vessel line-transect surveys is available from the Langkawi Archipelago, Peninsular Malaysia (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm., August 2017).</p>  An estimate for a large area in the coastal waters of Bangladesh was 1,382 (CV 55%) but the density was very low compared to some of the reported densities of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in Japanese waters (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>The type specimen was supposed to have come from the Cape of Good Hope, but this location is believed to be erroneous; it is now generally accepted that the type locality is the Malabar coast of India (Rice 1998, Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In general, Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises occur in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal marine waters (as well as some river mouths and estuaries) around the northern rim of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans from the Persian/Arabian Gulf (Preen 2004, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2005) eastwards around the rim of the Indian Ocean to the Indo-Malay region (Ponnampalam 2012) and to Java, Indonesia (but apparently not the Philippines) and northwards to the Taiwan Strait and central Chinese waters (Gao 1991, Gao and Zhou 1995). This is the more tropical and wide-ranging of the two species of Finless Porpoises. Records of this species from northern Chinese waters (e.g., Wang 1992) probably represent rare or extralimital events. Finless Porpoises are seen regularly (when sea conditions are favourable) in Sarawak, East Malaysia (Minton <em>et al. </em>2011), in at least parts of Peninsular Malaysia (e.g., they are the most frequently seen cetaceans around the Langkawi Archipelago according to Louisa Ponnampalam (pers. comm. 2017, J.Y. Wang unpublished data)), year-round (but with seasonal influxes) in Hong Kong (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2002a), and in parts of the western Taiwan Strait (J.Y. Wang unpub. data). They are also present along the East Kalimantan coastline of Borneo (D. Kreb pers. comm. 2011). In India, they are found in shallow waters along virtually the entire length of both the east and the west coasts, with sightings and strandings more commonly reported on the west coast (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017). One possible explanation for the difference is that the east coast has only pockets of preferred habitat, while more continuous or contiguous porpoise habitat is available along the west coast (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Given the paucity of dedicated cetacean survey effort in much of the speciesâ suspected range, the map includes the possible or projected range where oceanic features are consistent with the speciesâ known preferred habitat. As such, the species has not been recorded for all the states within the hypothetical range as shown on the map. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are marked as 'Resident' in the list of countries of occurrence. States within the hypothetical range, but for which no confirmed records exist, are included in the list as 'Seasonal Occurrence Uncertain'.</p>",There is no known trade in the taxon.,Marine,"<p>  </p>  <p>This species (which is presently listed as a single species with <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) is included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).

The sub-committee also recommended that bycatch monitoring be improved in all areas of known overlap between Finless Porpoise occurrence and fishing activity, especially gillnetting.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Water temperature in the streams range between 16.9â18.6 degrees C (17.8 Â± 0.5 degrees C) and the depth of water varies from 40â80 cm. Individuals have been commonly observed on the moss-covered boulders by, next to, and in streams. Most boulders have accumulated leaf litter on the surface, under which individuals and amplectant pairs have been found (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). All juveniles were observed near stream banks covered with leaf litter and gravel. All other individuals were found on the land within ~1-2 m of water. Of the males observed, 89% were found on boulders (2â4 m circumference, 30â50 cm above the water level) in mid-stream (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). When disturbed, individuals of this species dive into the streams and retreat into submerged rocky crevices, remaining underwater up to 15â25 minutes without emerging. Ten pairs in amplexus have also been found underwater, but no details of egg laying and development have been noted (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It is expected to breed in streams by larval development,&#160;as with its congeners.&#160;This species is not likely to tolerate habitat disturbance (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).","Within the Peak Wilderness Nature Reserve, Sripada Peak is a place of worship of all religions in the country of Sri Lanka, with millions of visitors, especially during the six-month-long peak tourism season. During this time, a large amount of garbage collects, light pollution increases, and the forest is exploited (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2013). A stream at one of the popular tourist sites, 'Seethagagula', has been blocked in one place by a private company, and the water has been diverted to an artificial tank to facilitate a place for visitors to bathe (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020).&#160;Downstream from this site large amounts of domestic chemicals (e.g., shampoo) are being disposed of in the stream, and it is suspected that this could negatively impact amphibian populations given that large aggregations of tadpoles (not of this species) were observed at higher elevations of the same stream, but in areas below the polluted site low densities or no individuals were observed (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020). Furthermore, during the dry season the reduced volume of water in the stream may lead to greater concentrations of chemicals in the breeding pools (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020).<br/><br/>Tea cultivation in the surrounding areas is slowly expanding, and illegal tree felling to cultivate tea has become a major threat in the area.&#160;Additionally, during the wet season fish species such as the Stone Sucker&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Garra ceylonensis</span>) travel upstream and block the stream in several places, which could create a barrier for the breeding of this species as it is suspected to breed in streams (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020). Invasive plant species are also suspected of causing changes to the understory and canopy cover of the area (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020). Road construction and the planting of non-native tree species may lead to soil erosion and landslides, making existing habitat unsuitable for this species (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Within&#160;Piduruthalagala Forest Reserve, the construction of mini hydropower stations pose&#160;a threat to the species (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change also presents a threat to this species, as annual rainfall is declining steeply across this region, especially on the perhumid western slopes. This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016).&#160; This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8Â° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1Â° C (De Costa 2008).&#160; These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests).&#160;<span><br/><span><br/><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a6ef881a-7fff-ab3c-8644-7da02d2b74d6"">Forest dieback could be an additional threat to this species. It was first observed in Sri Lankaâs montane âcloudâ forests by Perera (1978). Prior to 2013, dieback was never documented within Peak Wilderness, and now a large area has been affected (Wickramasinghe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).Despite several studies (see Ranasinghe and Dissanayake 2003, Ranasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2007, Chandrajith<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2009), the aetiology of&#160; dieback remains enigmatic, though there has been concern that an environmental stressor that kills extensive stands of woody vegetation, apart from the loss of suitable habitats for amphibians, may also directly threaten amphibians. Gunawardena<em> </em><em>et al</em>. (1998) and Jayalal<em> et al.</em> (2017) suggest that high acidity in mist- and rain-water may present a significant risk to the highland biota in Sri Lanka. While there is no direct evidence to date (see Silva <em>et al.</em> 2019) that amphibians are negatively affected; it is thought to be a threat for species that inhabit areas where mist persists for long periods, and for species found in open habitats with aquatic life history stages in shallow lentic habitats (M.

It was rediscovered in 2009, when close to 100 individuals were recorded over the course of a two-year study to document amphibian species richness across an elevational gradient (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012). Another subpopulation of 57 individuals was discovered 42 km away during further surveys from 2011-2014 (Gabadage <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). This species is thought to be common in suitable habitats during the wet season, however the pristine stream habitats in which it occurs are difficult to find (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).

Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small geographically isolated subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt; 1000 mature individuals. Anthropogenic mortality of only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals per year from a population of 100 individuals would result in 30%, 50% and 80% declines in population abundance after 3 generations, respectively (see Moore 2015 Table 5).</p>  <p>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the speciesâ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the speciesâ range in Australia (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012; Bejder<em> et al.</em> 2012; Cagnazzi<em> et al.</em> 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown<em> et al.</em> 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell<em> et al.</em> 2013). Additionally, the speciesâ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  Considering the available evidence and following a precautionary approach we considered this species as Vulnerable under IUCN criterion C2a(i) because the total number of mature individuals is plausibly fewer than 10,000, a projected continuing decline due to cumulative impacts; and each of the defined subpopulations studied to date is estimated to contain fewer than 1,000 mature individuals. Although the species may not meet any of the criteria for Endangered at this time, it is likely to do so in the near future considering It is possible that 1) number of mature individuals is less than 2,500, 2) the reductions in population size have been larger and pervasive enough to cause a net reduction for the entire species of at least 20% over a period of 2 generations and 3) that the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation across their range is â¤ 250 individuals.","<p>Within their geographical range Australian Humpback Dolphins are found primarily in coastal waters. Opportunistic data collected during aerial surveys designed to estimate the distribution and abundance of Dugongs (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) in the Great Barrier Reef indicated that Australian Humpback Dolphins were sighted on average 6.4 km (se = 1.26, Range 0-55.6 km) from the nearest point of land and 2.7 km (std. err. = 0.27, range = 0-8.1 km) to the nearest shallow area (either point of land or charted reef, less than 2m deep at low tide) (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997). In Queensland and in the Northern Territory humpback dolphins are found mostly within 10 km off the coast (Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). Accordingly, in Keppel Bay, Central Queensland, where up to 10 km offshore waters still remain below 10m in depth, Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were recorded on average 2.8 km (SD = 4.21, Range = 0-24 km) off the coast. In Western Australia, sightings obtained from recent exploratory surveys and ongoing studies seem to confirm a similar pattern, with the majority of the sightings obtained within 5 km off the coast (Brown and Hunt personal communication). In Papua New Guinea, the first tentative sightings of Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were made in the Kikori Delta region; close to the coastline and in waters 1.6-11.4 m deep (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>While coastal waters are arguably the primary habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins, most survey work has been conducted close to the coast, thus the extent to which humpback dolphins use offshore waters is not yet fully understood. Observations of Australian Humpback Dolphins at least up to 55.6 km from land, indicate that this species may occasionally venture further offshore especially in sheltered and protected waters such as in the Great Barrier Reef where sand flats occur almost continuously from the mainland to the outer reefs (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997).</p>  <p>Along the Australian Coast Humpback Dolphins are more likely to be found in relatively shallow and protected coastal habitats such as inlets, estuaries, shallow bays, inshore reefs and coastal archipelagos rather than in open stretches of coastline. In Queensland and Northern Territory, humpback dolphins are mainly found in water less than 20 km from the nearest river mouth and in water less than 15-20 m deep (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). Few animals have been observed in waters up to 30-50 m deep, but remained in close proximity (within 5 km) to the coast (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). In both Queensland and Northern Territory humpback dolphins have been also recorded as far as 20-50 km upstream in large rivers such as the East Alligator River, Northern Territory, and in the Fitzroy and Brisbane rivers in Queensland (Cagnazzi 2010, Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). No studies on habitat use have been conducted in Western Australia. Preliminary surveys and ongoing studies in few locations indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins appear to utilize a wide range of near-shore habitats. For example, around the North West Cape, dolphins have been sighted in clear waters over Ningaloo Reef, and in turbid waters in Exmouth Gulf, and in depths ranging from 1 to 40 m deep (T. Hunt 2015, pers. comm., 19 February) </p>  <p>Among subpopulations there appear to be some differences in habitat selection suggesting high adaptability of this species to local environment characteristics. For example, in Cleveland Bay Australian Humpback Dolphins showed preferences for waters close to the coast and 2-5 m deep, followed by waters 1-2 m deep whereas in Keppel Bay (~630 Km south) humpback dolphins showed preference for waters 2-5 and 5-10 m deep, while In Port Curtis (~700 km further south) humpback dolphins showed preference for water 5-10 and 10-15 m deep. Within these regions humpback dolphins showed selection for various types of habitats including dredged channels, reefs, seagrass flats and mangroves.</p>  Across Australia, humpback dolphins have been observed feeding in a wide range of inshore-estuarine coastal habitats including rivers and creeks, expose banks, shallow flats, rock and coral reefs as well as over submerged reefs in waters at least up to 40 m deep (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012, Cagnazzi 2010, Parra 2006, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). The analysis of stomach contents of 6 humpback dolphins stranded in Queensland indicated they are opportunistic-generalist feeders, preying on a wide variety of fishes including both bottom-dwelling species (e.g., grunts, tooth ponyfishes, croakers, flatheads, and whitings) as<strong> </strong>well as pelagic species (e.g., cardinal fishes, gizzard shads, anchovies, false trevally and barracudas) (Parra and JedensjÃ¶ 2014). Among these, Grunt fish (<em>Pomadasys</em> sp.) were the most numerically important prey accounting for more than half (52.9%) of all prey items, followed by the cardinal fish (<em>Apogon </em>sp., 10.4%) and smelt-whiting (<em>Sillago </em>sp., 9.7%) (Parra and JedensjÃ¶ 2014)","<strong>Habitat Loss and Degradation<br/></strong>Several regions across Humpback Dolphinsâ range in Australia have been substantially modified both inland, to allow mining, agricultural and grazing activities and along the coast to allow industrial ports; marinas, aquaculture and residential developments. Concurrently, several mining industries are undergoing major upgrades and extensions, while new extraction sites have been proposed to meet an increasing export demand of primary resources (carbon, oil, natural gas, woods, aluminium and uranium), particularly in northwestern Australia and along the central coast of Queensland (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Queensland Government 2012). As a result significant expansions of existing ports facilities are underway across the coastal range of Australian Humpback Dolphins (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) For example, by 2020 the port capacity along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Queensland, is expected to triple to support the predicted growth in Queenslandâs annual coal production (Grech <em>et al</em>. 2013). The IUCN considered this unprecedented scale of development as a serious threat to biodiversity in the GBRWHA (Douvere and Badman 2012).<br/><br/>Activities associated with coastal zone developments such as land reclamation, dredging, seismic surveys, drilling, blasting, shipping and resource extraction may result in habitat loss and degradation for Australian Humpback Dolphins. For example, it has been estimated that in the Fitzroy River, Queensland, between 14 to 25% of Australian Snubfin Dolphin (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) habitat (which largely overlaps with that of Australian Humpback Dolphins) will be directly modified if a planned industrial port development were to occur (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Besides their influence on dolphinsâ habitat, these activities have the potential to cause disturbance of humpback dolphinsâ normal activities through physical displacement and increasing underwater noise pollution (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dredging involved in the construction, maintenance and expansion of ports is of particular concern as it may potentially displace dolphins from important habitats as a result of changes in fish distribution, increased vessel activities, declining water quality and underwater noise (Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Todd <em>et al</em>. 2015). Because most ports across the Australian Humpback Dolphins range are located in relatively shallow waters, they all require large volumes of dredging. For example, the Gladstone Western Basin project in Queensland involved the dredging of 22 million cubic meters of soil (Ports Australia 2014).<br/><br/>Additionally habitat loss and fragmentation from coastal zone developments and associated activities can influence the population genetic structure of biological populations through their isolation (Keyghobadi 2007). Given the small densities, strong population genetic structure and limited gene flow found among subpopulations of Australian Humpback Dolphins; loss of genetic variation may reduce the ability of individuals to adapt to a changing environment, cause inbreeding depression, reduce survival and reproduction and increase their probability of extinction (Andrews 2014, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><strong><br/>By-catch</strong><br/>Human-related mortality of humpback dolphins in Australian waters is thought to be largely attributable to by-catch in shark nets set for swimmers protection by the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) and in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries for Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em> Bloch 1970) and Threadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em> Macleay 1884) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> Shaw 1804) (Hale 1997, Paterson 1990). There are no estimates of the magnitude of these indirect takes or of their trend over the time.<br/><br/>Fisheries observers on gillnet vessels operating in northern Australian waters between 1981-1985 reported one Australian Humpback Dolphin among the cetacean species incidentally taken (Harwood and Hembree 1987). At least 18 Humpback Dolphins were collected from shark nets along the Queensland coast between 1968-2001 (Haines and Limpus 2002, Heinsohn 1979). Between 1997-2007 a further 13 humpback dolphins were reported caught in the QSCP shark nets and drumlines (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Shark nets have now been removed from most of the Queensland coast and captures of dolphins appear to be small at a state level (Gribble <em>et al</em>. 1998). For example, between 2008 and 2011 no humpback dolphin was reported caught in the shark nets, despite QSCP accounting for 73% of all cetaceans mortalities (Meager <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, given the low population sizes at which this species occurs, the death of even a few individuals per year at a local level could have detrimental consequences on the viability of local subpopulations.<br/><br/><strong>Water pollution</strong><br/>Sources of anthropogenic contaminants are likely to increase in the future across northern Australia, as a result of a widespread contamination by several new pesticides (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012), increasing annual runoff (Chiew and McMahon 2002), and rapid urban and industrial development. As coastal top predators, humpback dolphins may accumulate high concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants through bioaccumulation (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>The water discharge by many rivers across the Humpback Dolphinâs range in Australia is of poor quality, often with contaminant concentrations likely to cause environmental harm (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2012, Francey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Schaffelke <em>et al</em>. 2012). For example an assessment of the relative risk of pollutants from agricultural and land uses ranked most of the rivers in Queensland as relatively high priority (Waterhouse <em>et al</em>. 2012). Agricultural and industrial-sourced pollutants have been identified as the major threats to the coastal water quality especially along the Great Barrier Reef. As a result various contaminants, were detected in sediments samples as well as in several marine species known to be part of the humpback dolphin diet (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Accordingly, a recent study detected high levels of organochlorine compounds (DDTs, PCBs, HCB) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in biopsy samples collected from humpback dolphins along the Queensland coast (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Although exposure to contaminants may not directly cause the death of an animal, it may affect the dolphinsâ health in numerous ways, including an increased susceptibility to diseases and impairment of metabolic functions (Bossart 2011, De Swart <em>et al</em>. 1996). The immunosuppressive effect of contaminants may play an important role in the death of humpback dolphins following large floods and major industrial coastal developments (DEHP 2012, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Underwater Noise</strong><br/>Sounds introduced into the marine environment by anthropogenic activities (e.g., dredging, pile-driving, underwater surveying, shipping) may have detrimental effects on marine mammals by interfering with their ability to communicate, echolocate, and/or mask other important natural sounds (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 1995, Nowacek <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>For example, impulsive hammering sounds can be loud, and levels as high as 165 dB re 1 mPa were measured 1 km from a hammer used for pipe installation (Bailey <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent study conducted in the Pearl River Estuary of China, near Hong Kong, to monitor the effects of the world's largest vibration hammer (OCTA-KONG) on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins has suggested that the vibration zone detectable by individual animal extends beyond 3.5 km. While Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins clicks do not appear to be adversely affected, the whistles were susceptible to auditory masking and a safety zone of 500 m radius was proposed (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Floods</strong><br/>Peak mortality of inshore dolphins In Queensland, including Australian Humpback Dolphins, followed sustained periods of elevated freshwater discharge (9 months) (Meager and Limpus 2014). In Queensland floods exceed their natural ranges of variation due to inland catchment modifications that result in a large amount of sediments, heavy metals, nutrients and pesticides being discharged into the estuaries and adjacent coastal areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Furnas 2003). Increases in freshwater discharge may also increase exposure to infectious pathogens such as toxoplasmosis; which has been observed and thought to be the cause of death of four Australian Humpback Dolphins (Bowater <em>et al</em>. 2003). Modelling studies estimated that in some areas the annual runoff in catchments across Australia could increase to up to 15% by the year 2030, due to the increased in rainfall associated with global warming (Chiew and McMahon 2002). Thus, the resilience and recovery capacity of the entire coastal ecosystem including humpback dolphinsâ preferred habitat may be put under great threat.<br/><br/><strong>Cumulative threats</strong><br/>The cumulative impact of environmental factors and anthropogenic activities is arguably the primary threat to humpback dolphins (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011). The continuous alteration of coastal systems have greatly undermined the resilience of many wildlife communities, populations, and species living in estuaries, making them more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity events and anthropogenic stressors (Hobday and Lough 2011). The loss of habitat quantity and quality has been identified among the primary drivers of population declines of marine animals. The reduction of suitable habitat may force local populations of humpback dolphins to adjust to the remaining resources through a reduction in survival rate and population size, or emigration to more suitable areas (Andren 1994, Fahrig 1997, Jefferson 2000). Such effects are likely to be exacerbated when natural systems are simultaneously subjected to multiple stressors as a result of cumulative impacts and negative synergistic interactions (Crain <em>et al</em>. 2008, Halpern <em>et al</em>. 2008, Venter <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Recent studies on other inshore dolphin populations living in highly industrialized regions have reported negative population trends. In the Pearl River estuary, China, modelling of demographic data from strandings of humpback dolphins predicted that the population was declining at about 2.4% per annum (Huang et al. 2012), in the Yangtze River the population of Yangtze Finless Porpoise is declining at a rate of about 6% p.a. (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012), while in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, the local isolated bottlenose dolphin population has declined at a rate of about 30% over the last 12 years (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2007). According to this evidence a reduction in the number of Australian Humpback Dolphins could be expected if the impacts of multiple port expansion, development projects, water pollution, vessel traffic and increasing frequency of natural catastrophic events are not properly addressed.","At present, there is no range-wide estimate of the abundance of Australian Humpback Dolphins. Estimates of abundance are available from several discrete locations across Australia (Supplementary Material: Table 1, see Fig. 1 for locations). Additionally, monitoring to estimate abundance is currently underway at several new locations in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Overall, available abundance estimates indicate that humpback dolphins occur in small subpopulations averaging 54-89 individuals and 0.1-0.19 individuals per kmÂ² (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the global number of âmature individualsâ (i.e. individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction) of Australian Humpback Dolphins is challenging, because relevant demographic data are insufficient or non-existent. If we assume that the proportion of mature individuals (Nm) is similar to that estimated for the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>), which is 50% (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007), each subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) numbers &lt;105 mature individuals. Considering that all available abundance estimates for Australian Humpback Dolphins are low (typically less than 150 individuals; Table 1 in the Supplementary Material), the total number of mature individuals across their range is unlikely to exceed 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>Estimates of population size trends across the speciesâ range are unknown. Surveys in Cleveland Bay, northeast Queensland, (1999-2002) showed low population sizes (34-54 individuals) and no clear trends, but indicated that even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates population trends will be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size were greater than 20% p.a. (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a). A longer multiyear study (2006-2011) in the Capricorn and Curtis Coast regions, Central Queensland, showed that abundance estimates declined throughout the study in Keppel Bay and Curtis coast region from 115 and 84 individuals in 2007 to 104 and 45 in 2011, respectively (Cagnazzi 2013). The decline in abundance estimates was associated with a large flood event in 2010 and the concurrent expansion of the Port Curtis port facilities (Cagnazzi 2013). Analyses of data collected until 2014 will clarify whether the observed decline is permanent or just a temporary shift in dolphin distribution.<br/><br/>Ongoing monitoring studies (2011-2014) in Bynoe Harbor, Darwin Harbor and Shoal Bay in the Northern Territory, have shown that the numbers of humpback dolphins in these areas are quite small (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) but have remained fairly stable throughout the years (Brooks and Pollock 2014). Estimates in Port Essington Harbor, Northern Territory, varied widely (48-207) among sampling periods (2008-2010). This variation was likely due to movements in and out of the study area, temporary emigration, temporal changes in behaviour, or temporal changes in detectability (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a).<br/><br/>Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small and localized subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt;1,000 mature individuals and that there could well be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. As with other cetaceans, the low reproductive rates of Australian Humpback Dolphins make them vulnerable to even low rates of anthropogenic mortality. For example, assuming a 3% recruitment rate (as estimated for <em>S. chinensis</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em> in Moore 2015) a discrete subpopulation of 100 individuals would decline by 30%, 50% and 80% over 75 years (three generations) if only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals were removed, respectively, per year due to anthropogenic mortality (see Table 5 in Moore 2015).<br/><br/>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the speciesâ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the speciesâ range in Australia (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell <em>et al</em>. 2013). Additionally, the speciesâ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Population Structure</strong><br/>Overall, the genetic data available suggest that Australian Humpback Dolphins exist as a metapopulation of small and relatively isolated subpopulations with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014, Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data). Analysis of population structure using both microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequence data from humpback dolphins from the Dampier Archipelago, and the North West Cape in north Western Australia (~300 km apart) showed significant levels of population structure with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014). Similarly, analysis of population structure among eight sampling locations (from tens to 1,500 kilo meters apart) along the east coast of Queensland indicated significant population differentiation and low levels of migration rates between most sampling locations (Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data).<br/><br/>The available evidence on abundance estimates (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) and population genetic structure indicates Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small, localized populations with limited gene flow. Abundance estimates suggest that there are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. Additionally, no subpopulation studied to date is larger than 200 mature individuals (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Substantial numbers of humpback dolphins have been killed in localized areas along the east coast of Queensland in anti-shark nets set to protect bathers (Heinsohn 1979, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004) . Humpback dolphins are also known to die in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries primarily for |Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) and T|hreadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em>) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> (Anderson 1995, Hale 1997). Given the continuing vulnerability to bycatch in shark nets and gillnets, low densities in surveyed areas, and increased habitat degradation throughout their range (see threats section) it is likely that a continuing decline of at least 10% will occur over a period of 3 generations (about 75 years, assuming generation length is similar to that estimated for <em>S. chinensis </em>in Moore 2015).",Decreasing,"Australian Humpback Dolphins are found in tropical/subtropical waters of the Sahul Shelf from northern Australia to the southern waters of the island of New Guinea(Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). In Australia humpback dolphins are thought to be widely distributed along the northern Australian coastline from approximately the Queensland-New South Wales border (31Â°27Â´S, 152Â°55Â´E) to western Shark Bay, Western Australia (25Â°51Â´S, E113Â°20Â´E). However, no dedicated wide-scale surveys throughout this range have been conducted and at present, this continuous distribution is inferred primarily from localized studies; strandings, museum records and aerial surveys for other species (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004). Similarly, the extent of their distribution in the southern waters off the island of New Guinea is also still unclear due to the limited amount of marine mammal survey work carried out in this region. Recent surveys in the Kikori Delta region of Papua New Guinea reported a total of 7 groups of humpback dolphins (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014). Photographic records of these animals indicate that they are likely <em>S. sahulensis</em> but genetic studies are needed to solidly clarify which Sousa species occurs off the island of New Guinea. It is also uncertain if the species occurs in the deep waters (~30-90 m depth) over the continental shelf between Australia and Indonesian New Guinea (the Arafura Sea).<br/><br/>Most studies to date indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins occur mostly close to the coast (within 20 km from land) and in relatively sheltered offshore waters near reefs or islands (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Corkeron <em>et al</em>. 1997, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006b). Furthermore, stomach content analyses indicate Australian Humpback Dolphins feed mainly on fishes associated with coastal-estuarine waters (Parra and JedensjÃ¶ 2014). As most survey work has been conducted in coastal waters, this apparent coastal distribution and preference for inshore habitats might be biased.<br/><br/>For purposes of this assessment and in line with discussions on the distribution range for <em>S. sahulensis</em> at the IUCN Workshop to Assess/Re-Assess IUCN Red Listings for Indo-Pacific Genera of Coastal Small Cetaceans (San Diego, 20-21 May 2015), we assume Australian Humpback Dolphins occur 1) continuously across northern Australia and southern New Guinea and 2) up to the 30 m isobath (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Material). Given these assumptions we estimate their geographic range to be approximately 562,193 kmÂ² comprised of: ~405,091 kmÂ² for Australia (QLD: ~202,344 kmÂ², NT: ~98,769 and WA: ~ 103,978 kmÂ²) and ~157,102 kmÂ² for southern New Guinea. The lack of spatial information on the occurrence of Australian Humpback Dolphins throughout their inferred range precludes an accurate estimation of their extent of occurrence (EOO; i.e. area contained within the shortest continuous imaginary boundary which can be drawn to encompass all the known, inferred or projected sites of present occurrence of a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy) and area of occupancy (AOO; i.e. area within its 'extent of occurrence' which is occupied by a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy). Although both EOO and AOO are likely to be significantly less than the geographic range estimated here, the large extent of their potential distribution suggests that their EOO and AOO are very likely to be above 20,000 kmÂ².","<p>There is no robust evidence of traditional use for consumption or medicinal use across the Australian humpback dolphinâs geographical range. In the 1960-70s live-captures (at least 8 individuals) took place in Queensland, Australia, for oceanarium displays (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). A female humpback dolphin wild caught in 1968 and currently held at Sea World (Amity) is estimated to be over 48 years of age. Capture for the purposes of public display is no longer permitted under Australian law.</p>",Marine,"<p>As a recently described new species, Australian Humpback Dolphins have not been listed under any national and International listing. Previous conservation assessments as <em>S. chinensis </em>are summarized<em> </em>in Table 2. The most recent assessment of the conservation status of humpback dolphins (as <em>S. chinensis</em> ) in Australia, concluded the species should be listed as Data Deficient (Woinarski<em> et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>In 2012 The Australian Federal Government commissioned a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and conservation status of Australian tropical inshore dolphins (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2012) and a Draft Coordinated Research Strategy to address knowledge gaps and assess their national conservation status (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2012). These reports led to a technical workshop attended by researchers, statisticians and government and indigenous representatives to review the proposed research objectives identified in the draft research strategy, and agree on research priorities that would allow the assessment of the conservation status of Australian inshore dolphins at a national level. The resulting research strategy (DSEWPaC 2013) identified three specific research objectives applicable to Australian snubfin and humpback dolphins: (1) to conduct a broad-scale assessment of their extent of occurrence and area of occupancy (2) to conduct dedicated multi-year studies of their distribution, abundance and habitat use at selected sites across northern Australia with differing levels of threatening processes; and (3) to undertake a spatial and temporal risk assessment of current and projected threatening processes. Sampling and statistical methods to achieve these objectives have been recently described in Brooks<em> et al.</em> (2014). Following these advances, the Australian Federal Government released in 2014 the Whale and Dolphin Protection Plan, which includes a National Dolphin Conservation Plan. This plan aims to guide research and conservation assessment of Australian Humpback Dolphins and snubfin dolphins by supporting research into their ecology and major threats over the next three years.</p>  <p>Multiple-use marine protected areas in Western Australia (e.g. Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef Marine Park), the Northern Territory (e.g. Garig Gunak Barlu), and Queensland (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Dugong Protected Areas; Moreton Bay Marine Park) cover a substantial portion of the known and presumed habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins in Australian waters and may provide some protection for humpback dolphins. To improve the quality of water discharged into the Great Barrier Reef, in 2008, the Australian Government invested $200 million in The Reef Rescue initiative to help farmers in the Great Barrier Reef catchments to improve farming practices to reduce sediment and nutrient run-off.</p>  <p>In Australia, humpback dolphins have also been identified as a conservation value in Commonwealth waters around Australia in the North, North-west and Temperate East Marine bioregional plans (DSEWPaC 2012a, b, c). These plans were developed under section 176 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and are aimed at improving management and decision making in relation to Australian marine biodiversity and resources. Biologically Important Areas (i.e. areas where species of conservation value displays important behaviors such as breeding, foraging, resting and migration) for the conservation of humpback dolphins were identified using available information at the time and expert scientific knowledge about speciesâ distribution, abundance and behavior in these regions.</p>  National Guidelines for Whale and Dolphin Watching and for interaction with seismic explorations provide some protection for inshore dolphins (DOE 2005, 2008). Strategies to reduce the entanglement and death of Australian Humpback Dolphins in nets set by The Queensland Shark Control Program for protection of bathers include the use of acoustic alarms, mixed use of nets and drumlines, overall reduction in the number of nets, and establishment of mammal rescue squads (DPI 2001, Gribble<em> et al.</em> 1998).",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

However the sum of the actual area of occupied habitat is only 0.9 km<sup>2</sup>. Both EOO and AOO are continuously declining.&#160;Due to the significant levels of human intervention required to support the species, it is on the cusp of being considered Extinct in the Wild, however, for this assessment we are considering the population still to be wild.&#160;The species is assessed as Critically Endangered (A3) as it is highly likely that the total population will decline by more than 80% in the next 10 years due to a combination of pressures which are summarised below.&#160;<br/><br/>1. All three remaining subpopulations (Kameoka, Okayama-1, Okayama-2; geographically isolated from each other) are severely threatened and maintained by conservation efforts at the present. If the conservation activities (e.g., maintaining spawning/nursery grounds, alleviating migration inhibition, etc.) ceased, all the subpopulations would seriously decline or go extinct within a few generations.&#160;<br/><br/>2. Although conditions needed for reproduction are produced by the operation of a movable weir for irrigation in all three sites, the necessity for such operation is decreasing due to other irrigation methods being made available (e.g., pumping water using electricity) and the abandonment of cultivation.&#160;<br/><br/>3. There have been years in which no yearlings were recruited at least in the Kameoka and Okayama-1 subpopulations; and the subpopulations could crash if this was to occur in two or more successive years.&#160;<br/><br/>4. Predation by the introduced Largemouth Bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) and the native Great Cormorant (<em>Phalacrocorax carbo</em>) is a serious problem for the Kameoka and Okayama-2 subpopulations.&#160;<br/><br/>5. In Kameoka, the construction of a park with a football stadium will begin in 2016 with completion scheduled for 2018. This will lead to the destruction of the major nursery grounds for the species.&#160;<br/><br/>6. The spawning conditions for the Okayama-1 subpopulation are currently maintained through intensive volunteer activity; this will be difficult to maintain indefinitely.&#160;<br/><br/>7. A road construction plan, increasing abandonment of paddy cultivation and increasing predation pressure threaten the Okayama-2 subpopulation.","The species reproduced in flood plains or temporary waters around rivers and lakes. Because such natural environments have almost disappeared in western Japan, the species currently utilizes similar environments artificially produced by rice-paddy cultivation. The adult fish gather into a spawning site when the water level rises by heavy rain in the early rainy season (June). Submergence of land is the key to spawning (Iwata 2006; Abe <em>et al. </em>2007a,b). Currently, this is artificially caused by raising a movable weir up at starting irrigation. The fish produce demersal adhesive eggs (Abe and Sakamoto 2011). The eggs hatch within 25 hours after spawning, and rapidly grow up using high productivity (e.g. Daphnia) in flood plains. After the irrigation period (late September), when the water level is lowered, the fish migrate to permanent waters (main channels or streams) and winter in shelters such as crevices in riverbeds and banks.&#160;The majority of fish mature at two years old, and the generation length is roughly 2.5â3 years.","<strong>Historic</strong>: After natural flood plains&#160;(spawning areas)&#160;disappeared, the species utilized the environments around rice paddies. However, paddy fields have largely been converted into housing or industrial areas. In addition agricultural field improvement projects since the 1960s, has led to a loss of environments used for spawning, early development and migration, and chemical insecticide and herbicide seriously affected the ecosystems around paddy fields. In most areas, the agricultural schedule was moved ahead along with the change in rice varieties cultivated, and became conflict with the species phenology. As a result, only three spawning areas currently remain for the species' reproduction.<br/><strong><br/>Current</strong>: Conditions of reproduction are produced by human agricultural activity, e.g., operation of a movable weir for irrigation, in all three remaining sites. The necessity of such operation is decreasing due to other irrigation methods available (e.g., pumping water using electricity) and the abandonment of cultivation. Also, the weirs work as migration inhibitors after they are raised up. Surrounding paddy fields have continued to be converted to housing or commercial areas. This reduces the potential habitat, and possibly causes light and noise pollution. Predation by the introduced Largemouth Bass <em>(Micropterus salmoides</em>) and the Great Cormorant (<em>Phalacrocorax carbo</em>) is a serious problem for the Kameoka and Okayama-2 subpopulations.<br/><strong><br/>Future</strong>: There is a plan to construct a city park with a football stadium by local governments (Kameoka City and Kyoto Prefecture) adjacent to the spawning and nursery ground of the species in Kameoka (the largest subpopulation). A conservation area will be created, but there is great uncertainty whether it can contribute to the conservation of this species, due to insufficient scientific evidence. The spawning conditions for the Okayama-1 and -2 subpopulations are currently maintained by intensive volunteersâ activities, which will be difficult to continue indefinitely. A road construction plan, increasing abandonment of paddy cultivation and increasing predation pressure threaten the Okayama-2 population.","The major population decline of the species occurred over 30 years ago, but habitat loss has continued until recently. The species currently reproduces only at three small areas in Kameoka (the Yodo River system), Okayama-1 (the Asahi River system), and Okayama-2 (the Yoshii River system). These three habitats have been maintained by intensive conservation efforts in the past one to three decades with cooperation among local people, NPOs, researchers, and governments. <br/><br/>Population estimation has been conducted for the Kameoka subpopulation every autumn in the past ten years, and is between 80â730 (average 440) adult fish (Watanabe <em>et al.</em> 2014). The Kameoka subpopulation is the largest of the three extant subpopulations, inferred based on genetically effective population size (Ne) (Watanabe <em>et al.</em>&#160;unpublished data). The recruitment varies drastically among years (from 0 to more than 2,000 yearlings in autumn), making the population unstable.<br/><br/>In the Okayama-1 subpopulation, the number of mature fish migrated to spawning site was about 50 to 160 (average 100) between 2010-2015 (Abe <em>et al</em>., unpublished data). The recruitment of Okayama-1 subpopulation was estimated to be about 210 individuals in 2015.&#160;The size of the Okayama-2 subpopulation has not been precisely evaluated but is roughly estimated at about 250 mature individuals on average based on the observation of upstream migrating fish. Effective population size is estimated to be about 30 to 500 by the genetic analysis in the Okayama-2 subpopulation (Watanabe <em>et al.</em>&#160;unpublished data). The recruitment in the Okayama-1 and 2 changes drastically among years as in the case of the Kameoka subpopulation.",Decreasing,"The species has a small geographical range in western Japan. Historically it occurred only in two geographically distant (&gt;100 km apart) regions; the Lake Biwa and Yodo River basin (in the Kinki Region), and in several rivers including the Yoshii, Asahi, Takahashi, and Ashida rivers in the (Sanyo Region).<br/><br/>In the last decade, reproduction of the species is confirmed only at three small sites; one at Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture, in the Kinki Region (referred to as Kameoka, hereafter), and two at Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture, in the Sanyo Region (Okayama-1 and -2). The subpopulations in the three sites are geographically isolated from each other. The spawning and nursery grounds are only a few hundred meters of a stream and small irrigation channels located within a ~0.15 km<sup>2</sup> rice field at Kameoka; and a 0.002 km<sup>2 </sup>(0.2 ha) conservation field at an abandoned paddy field in Okayama-1; and a&#160;0.005 km<sup>2</sup> (0.5ha)&#160;around a channel and rice field in Okayama-2. &#160;Because the species shows a small-scale migration between spawning ground and winter habitat, adult fish are sporadically found near the spawning sites.","Collection, trade, and possession of the species are prohibited by several Japanese laws, e.g., the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties as a natural monument, the Law for the Conservation of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and other local laws. However, illegal collection and trade are sometimes revealed even in recent years. The amount of such illegal trade is unknown, but the effect of poaching seems not very large.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Collection, trade, and possession of the species is regulated by several laws, e.g., the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties as a natural monument, the Law for the Conservation of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and other local laws.&#160;<br/>All three subpopulations have been maintained by conservation activities. If conservation activities ceased, all the subpopulations would seriously decline or go extinct within a few generations. Conserving and improvement of the spawning and nursery ground habitats have been conducted at all three sites with cooperation among local people, NPOs, researchers, and local and national governments. For example, raising a movable weir is essential to introduce the spawning conditions, but simultaneously works as a migration barrier. So, the adult fish below the weir are brought upstream of the weir by hand. Cultivation of paddy fields is compatible with the life history of the species, however, rapid water level control can pose a threat through the drying up of habitats (in such cases people move the fish to safe areas by hand).<br/><br/>Despite the current problems, the most important and reliable conservation strategy is to maintain the environments of the present habitats against development pressure.&#160;For the Kameoka subpopulation, a city park plan with a football stadium (to be completed in spring 2018) is expected to pose severe environmental changes to the spawning and nursery ground of the species. Based on precautionary principles many academic and conservation societies have called for the proposed plan to be withdrawn.<br/><br/>All three remaining habitats are too small to maintain stable viable populations. Creation of new habitats around the extant places is strongly recommended. <em>Ex situ</em> conservation plans with captive breeding have started for all three populations for future reintroduction or reinforcement.

Therefore, it is evaluated as Least Concern.&#160;However, fisheries landings have decreased notably over time, as the fishing fleet has increased in boats, fishermen and equipment, and is expected to continue decreasing in the near future. Additionally, there are many environmental stressors (e.g. deforestation and sedimentation) with negative effects on river integrity and fish populations within its distribution. Monitoring is therefore recommended.<br/><p></p>","<em>Prochilodus mariae</em> is freshwater, benthopelagic and potamodromous fish, and occupies (in different moments) all freshwater habitats in the mountains, foothills and plains. This species generally can&#160;be found in the flooded forests and lakes  associated with the rivers of the Orinoco basin and within the main  rivers during migration (Barbarino-Duque <em>et al</em>. 1998). In the ribazon<em>, </em>it occurs with several species, such as <em>Brycon, Piaractus, Mylossoma, Leporinus,&#160;Oxydoras,&#160;Brachyplatystoma, Hemisorubin, </em>and<em> Pseudoplatystoma</em>.<br/><br/>The species has two migrations per year; the first for reproduction when the rains increase water levels in April and May, and a second when the water descends in November and December and the fish move from the lagoons to the main rivers and canals to avoid the warming waters (Galvis <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zapata-Padilla and Usma-Oviedo 2013). In the rainy season the species reproduce and spends in the savannas flooded with lentic bodies (lagoons, ""prÃ©stamos"", ""esteros"" and ""bajÃ­os""). As the dry season begins, the vast majority of the population moves upstream (called ribazÃ³n in Venezuela and subienda in Colombia) to the Andean foothills and (in minor quantities) to the mountains in the Guiana Shield, where it remains until the rains return. It travels high into the mountains and surprisingly reaches small streams with hardly any water (Taphorn 1992). In these small rivers it remains until the rainy season increases the flow considerably, at which time it descends to the plains (usually in the midst of floods) and in the course of this it reproduces. It demonstrates long distance, longitudinal and local migration estimated at between 100 and 500 km distance in several tributaries of Orinoco, principally in Andean versants.&#160; In the migrations events, Barbarino <em>et al.</em> (1998) estimated an density of 863,200 ind/ha in Apure river (lowlands) and 198,000 ind/ha for the Guanare river (upper llanos).<br/><br/>The species is a iliophagous and detritivorous fish. The diet includes protozoa and bacteria from sludge and detritus, epibenthic algae and plankton (Taphorn 1992). Immature individuals consume more algae and less mud (fine amorphous detritus) than adults; the latter eat diatoms and filamentous algae (Barbarino <em>et al. </em>1998). <br/><br/>In the Meta river the maximum length of the species is 45 cm standard length (RamÃ­rez-Gil <em>et al</em>. 2015), but it can reach around 500 mm SL and 3 kg. However the average is much lower, probably associated with fishing pressure. The species has larger sizes in flood areas and lagoons than in rivers. The females at age at 23 cm SL in Apure river (Barbarino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998),&#160;and they reach a fertility of 824,265 eggs in the lower Orinoco (Nova and Ramos 1982).&#160;In upper plains of Apure (caÃ±o Maraca) the species has a generation length of 24 months and fecundity of 28,950 eggs/female with mean length of 260 mm standard length (Winemiller and Taphorn 1989). It is estimated that the reproduction is massive and occurs in the channel of rivers and during flood events. The fertilized eggs are carried away by the current and are deposited in flooding plains where then the larvae hatch.","<p>Drainage basin degradation and land use change in the Orinoco basin&#160;are a result of massive deforestation (Oliveira-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2010), causing significant erosion in the upper basins and the fragmentation and loss of streams and rivers due to sedimentation (Dudgeon 2008). The loss of these piedmont rivers has an important effect on the life cycle of <em>P. mariae </em>(Lilyestrom and Taphorn 1978, Winemiller <em>et al</em>. 1996). Another threat in this area is tree clearance in riparian zones, often illegal, which changes light regimes and can increase mortality rates of fish larvae due to increased ultraviolet radiation. Nutrients formerly from wood and debris is also removed from the ecosystem. The loss of this wood debris may also impact rates of predation as schools of fish in open water seek out debris for shelter (Wright and Flecker 2004). In&#160;Venezuela, the several dams in Andean and coastal ranges impede upstream migration of <em>Prochilodus mariae</em>, alongside many species of pimelodid catfishes. However, the main current and future threat to the species is the commercial fishery, which occurs with greater intensity in the Apure river basin and in the lower and middle Orinoco. The reduction of <em>Prochilodus mariae</em> by fisheries could disrupt carbon flow in river and probably alter the ecosystem metabolism (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2006), including the loss of its role as habitat modifiers and maintainers for other species.&#160;</p>","<p>This species is very abundant and temporarily can dominate in number and biomass in foothill rivers (e.g. Las MarÃ­as river in Apure drainage; Flecker 1996). Following data collection between 2004 and 2009, the species has exhibited overall declines in landing numbers and over-exploitation is cited as the key driver of these declines. However, it should also be considered that subpopulations vary extensively year to year as a result of environmental factors, such as high rain years. Simultaneously the average size of this species has also decreased over time suggesting unsustainable fishing methodologies (Lasso <em>et al.</em> 2011). Even though the fishing records are variable, the evidence and general trends indicate that the population of the species is declining and this has been true for decades (e.g. Barbarino-Duque <em>et al.</em> 1998, Novoa 2002).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""ES"">The type locality for <em>Prochilodus</em><span lang=""ES""><em> mariae</em>&#160;is BarrigÃ³n, RÃ­o Meta in Colombia (Eigenmann 1922).

Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa. A continuing population decline of at least 10% in a&#160;90 year three generation period,&#160;is anticipated based on continuing and increasing anthropogenic threats (Vulnerable C1).<br/><br/>The African Manatee therefore qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>West and Central Africa contain a variety of suitable habitats for Manatees ranging from large and small rivers, coastal estuaries, freshwater and saltwater lagoons, shallow quiet coastal bays, lakes and reservoirs. Like <em>T. manatus</em>, <em>T. senegalensis</em> inhabits practically every accessible habitat (Powell 1996, Dodman <em>et al.</em> 2008). They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in CÃ´te dâIvoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermenâs nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as CÃ´te dâIvoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabonâs Nâdogo and Nâgowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1â2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and CÃ´te dâIvoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In CÃ´te dâIvoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and AraÃºjo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990â1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In CÃ´te dâIvoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in CÃ´te dâIvoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in CÃ´te dâIvoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-BodjrÃ¨nou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, CÃ´te dâIvoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 â 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and CÃ´te dâIvoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for CÃ´te d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegalâs fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (ThÃ©ophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and AraÃºjo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and AraÃºjo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and AraÃºjo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, KonkourÃ© and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (ThÃ©ophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (ThÃ©ophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and BokÃ©, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (ThÃ©ophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at DubrÃ©ka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in KanfarandÃ© (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermenâs nets and released in DubrÃ©ka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>CÃ´te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in CÃ´te dâIvoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in CÃ´te dâIvoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of CÃ´te dâIvoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the EbriÃ© lagoon complex with the mouth of River ComoÃ©; the west EbriÃ© lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of GÃ´ and Boubo; Nâgni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the Nâgni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750â800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the countryâs terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled âEnhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghanaâ. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, AbatÃ©kopÃ© (near AnÃ©ho), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, KÃ©ta, Akoda and KouÃ©nou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of AmÃ©dÃ©hoÃ©vÃ© and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; AdamÃ©. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of AgomÃ©-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono Riverâs Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de lâEnvironment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in DÃ©kpoÃ© in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-BodjrÃ©nou 2003, Dossou-BodjrÃ©nou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the MÃ©krou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, WÃ©bossou, SÃ¨kodji GomÃ¨, Ouinhi, Agonli-HouÃ©gbo (Kpoto) and Lac SÃ©lÃ© (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-BodjrÃ©nou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-YaourÃ© 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of HÃªvÃª and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-BodjrÃ©nou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes TrÃ©nÃ© and LÃ©rÃ© in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and AnnobÃ³n islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (RÃ©publica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the MitÃ©mÃ©lÃ© River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the Nâgowe and Nâdogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of Nâdogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of LambarÃ©nÃ©, as well as occasionally in Nâdogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and LoÃ©mÃ© Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and BrÃ©heret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and BrÃ©heret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and BrÃ©heret 2007). In the LoÃ©mÃ© River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the LoÃ©mÃ©, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manateesâ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the TÃ´a Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake CaÃºmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Maliâs Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near DjennÃ© and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Nigerâs Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes LÃ©re and TrÃ©ne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes LÃ©re and TrÃ©ne, and that the local people have formed âmilitiasâ to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16Â°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9Â°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-YaourÃ© 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake LÃ©rÃ© and Lake TrÃ©nÃ© and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and AraÃºjo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, LogonÃ©, MitÃ©mÃ©lÃ©, Gabon, OgoouÃ©, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, LoÃ©mÃ©, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake LÃ©rÃ© and Lake de TrÃ©nÃ© (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: DigbouÃ© Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, EbriÃ© Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, Nâgowe (Iguela) Lagoon, Nâdogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  CÃ´te dâIvoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animalsâ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>CÃ´te dâIvoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989â2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoiâs staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007â2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

Its area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 366 kmÂ²<span class=""A10"">, and the extent of occupancy is 2,128 kmÂ². The species is known to exist at no more than four locations. The area and quality of its available habitat is declining due to agricultural intensification. This decline is predicted to continue into the future.","<p>The species is an inhabitant of steppe and forest-steppe grasslands. It is typically found in areas of closed steppe on loess (Natura 2000 code: 6240*) and uncharacteristic dry grasslands (mostly degraded or secondary dry grasslands), <span lang=""EN-US"">and loess in mesic grasslands. Also present in perennial intensive arable fields (such as alfalfa), and the mosaics above (SugÃ¡r 2012). <span lang=""EN-US"">The species seems to prefer slopes over valleys, although avoids very steep slopes (SugÃ¡r 2012). Most of its habitats are used as pastureland, however it seems to avoid overgrazed pastures. It may occasionally enter some small-plot arable lands, especially alfalfa, for foraging. Strictly subterranean, and more agile and aggressive compared to <em>Nannospalax </em>(superspecies <em>leucodon</em>). Blind mole rats are a food resource for several threatened species of birds of prey, the survival, reproductive success, and population size of these species may partly depend on the density of the rodents (NÃ©meth <em>et al</em></span>. 2016).</p>","<p>The most important threatening factors are the different processes leading to habitat loss. In the past, the expansion of agriculture was the most prominent cause for the loss of the best habitats for blind mole rats. The most fertile loess soils were the first to undergo changes in land use which has pushed blind mole-rat populations to less favourable areas. The widespread use of deep tillage was the single most important direct effect that drastically reduced blind mole-rat population sizes and distribution. Firstly, repeated ploughing does not allow the formation of the vegetation type necessary for the survival of blind mole-rats; secondly, deep ploughing destroys their underground burrow systems as well as the animals themselves. Small plot farming with mosaics of fallow land has often given way to intensive crop production in large monocultures. Nowadays, the most common reason causing tillage is not so much the cultivation itself but the fulfilment of the requirements to apply for funding from the European Community. Blind mole rats often colonise abandoned land if that is close to their habitat. When the owner decides to start cultivating again, these subpopulations can be destroyed.<br/><br/>Urbanisation, site development and road constructions are threats to this species<em>. </em>Most of the land in these cases is the property of the municipality and impending industrial investments can mean complete eradication. Road construction can also annihilate populations. This mainly concerns non-protected areas.<br/><br/>Overgrazing<strong> </strong>greatly reduces species diversity, and causes a significant decrease in the food resources of blind mole-rats. Sheep populations within the speciesâ range are generally very high, and grazing is currently not controlled by any effective legal means, which has led to a decline or local extinction of several plant and animal species dependent on dry grasslands (e.g. meadow viper <em>Vipera ursinii rakosiensis</em>).<br/><br/>Limited habitat sizes and low population sizes threaten the long-term viability of populations with inbreeding and other genetic problems.<br/><br/>Hadid <em>et al</em>. (2012) analysed the phylogeny of the subfamily Spalacinae calibrated by fossil records. Revealed evolutionary events show a remarkable synchronization with the cycles of solar orbital fluctuations (eccentricity and precession) driving the ice ages. This makes it plausible that global climate changes following the ice ages played an important role in the formation of the unusually high genetic diversity of blind mole-rats.<br/><br/>We can also be sure that the present changes in global climate will significantly impact blind mole-rats, but the direction and the extent of this impact cannot be predicted. In the past, such processes resulted in new taxa of blind mole-rats, but current changes are heavily distorted by human influence. There is a whole host of evidence (Nevo <em>et al </em>1994a,b, 1995; 2000a,b; Reyes <em>et al</em>. 2003; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) that genetically and geographically distinct taxa adapted to the specific climate of their own range during their speciation. However, blind mole-rat habitats have shrunk to small, isolated fragments that are few and far between, within a matrix impenetrable for blind mole-rats. Isolation is further abetted by their severely limited dispersal capacities. Thus, there is a high likelihood that ongoing climatic changes would rather wipe out blind mole-rat species than give rise to new ones.<br/><br/>Even though MÃ©helyâs blind mole rat is a protected species in Romania, there are still cases of intentional destruction. It is extremely hard to measure this kind of activity. Conflicts arise from some individuals living and foraging close to human settlements, damaging ornamental plants and vegetables. Another anthropogenic threat is the disturbance and destruction caused by pets (dogs as well as cats). Stray dogs and herding dogs are known to have killed individuals.</p>    <p><br/></p>","<p>Population is fragmented, and habitat fragmentation is ongoing.

107249015,245,Acipenser oxyrinchus,Near Threatened,,2006,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>A. oxyrinchus</em> occurs in the Atlantic coastal waters of Canada and the United States with spawning rivers in both countries. <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> historically ranged along the Canadian and U.S. Atlantic Coast from Labrador to Florida. Though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> occurs in most major river systems from the Mississippi River to the Suwannee River in Florida and in marine waters of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico south to Florida Bay. <br/> <br/>As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997, although Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River and in the Saint John River. The current number of mature individuals most likely numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy for this subspecies is very large (&gt;1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline). Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and re-colonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations. Throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, sturgeon breeding habitats have been adversely impacted by dams, siltation, channel maintenance (dredging) and water pollution.  Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. The subspecies is assessed as Near Threatened based on past population declines and because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery. <br/> <br/>Records for <em>A. o. desotoi</em> fisheries during the period 1887â1985 indicated that peak Florida harvest occurred in 1900â1902 (124 mt/year) followed by precipitous decline into the 1920s.  From 1923â1971 harvest was fairly stable at about 7 mt per year; declined to 2.3 mt through the 1970s; and fell further to only 0.3 mt until fisheries were closed in 1986 (Barkuloo 1988). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. With a relatively small and widely scattered population, continued habitat disturbances and contaminant threats, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> is assessed as Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>Overall, the Atlantic sturgeon <em>A. oxyrinchus</em> is considered Near Threatened based on the population declines suffered in the past and uncertainties about overall health of the population and the lengthy time required for recovery.","The Atlantic sturgeon is a large anadromous species. <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> is recorded to live for up to 60 years and reach a size of 4.3 m and 368 kg (Vladykov and Greely 1963), though most mature fish are considerably smaller. Spawning occurs in fresh or slightly brackish water when water temperatures reached 13â18ËC. Migrations into coastal tidal rivers begin as early as February in the southern portion of the range and continue through June and July in northernmost waters. In the mid-Atlantic area, Atlantic sturgeon males mature at 6â10 years and females at 10â20 years (ASMFC 1990). Maturation occurs earlier in southern waters and later in Canada. Spawning periodicity ranges from 2â6 years. Based on tagging studies ocean migrations of up to 1,450 km have been recorded (Dovel and Berggren 1983).","Atlantic sturgeon were an important item of commerce to early American and Canadian colonists and large quantities of meat, roe, oil and isinglass were exported to Europe late 17th and 18th centuries. As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. <br/> <br/>Competition, predation, diseases and parasites were evaluated in the 1998 status review by USFWS-NMFS and determined not to be limiting factors for Atlantic sturgeon stocks. Throughout the 20th century, sturgeon breeding habitats have been adversely impacted by dams, siltation, channel maintenance (dredging) and water pollution. Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. Continued application of existing U.S. laws (e.g., Clean Water Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, etc.) should result in improvements sturgeon breeding and nursery habitats. With management measures in place the current population trend for Atlantic sturgeon is increasing. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. Tissue and egg samples of Gulf sturgeon have shown elevated levels of pesticides and heavy metals. Organochlorines such as DDT and its derivatives DDD and/or DDE and toxaphene appear in most samples, sometime in concentrations exceeding U.S. Federal Drug Administration action levels for human consumption. High concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons (both from petroleum products) were detected in most Gulf sturgeon samples from numerous Florida rivers. Arsenic and mercury were detected in 92% and 87% of sturgeon samples and cadmium occurred in 42% of samples (Bateman and Brim 1994).","Atlantic sturgeon were an important item of commerce to early American and Canadian colonists and large quantities of meat, roe, oil and isinglass were exported to Europe late 17th and 18th centuries. As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. The largest fishery was in the Delaware River and Bay which by 1890 supported over 1,000 fishermen and produced 2,300 metric tons of sturgeon product. Several dozen other rivers supported sturgeon fisheries and by the late 1890s, total Atlantic Coast U.S. landings reached 3,200 mt. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. Throughout the 1970s to mid-1980s, prior to declaration of fishing moratoria, annual U.S. harvest of Atlantic sturgeon ranged from 50â100 mt with most fish being taken from the Hudson River (NY), coastal New Jersey and the Carolinas (ASMFC 1990). <br/> <br/>In 1998, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a comprehensive ""Status Review of Atlantic Sturgeon"" in response to a petition to list this species as threatened or endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The assessment found that, though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). The number of mature individuals in this range-wide population was not estimated but most likely it numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy is very large (&gt; 1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline).  Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and recolonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations.   <br/> <br/><em>A. o. desotoi</em> population estimates have been completed for the Apalachicola, Suwannee, Yellow and Choctawhatchee rivers in Florida, Pascagoula River in Mississippi, and the Pearl and Bogue Chitto rivers in Louisiana and Mississippi. The Suwannee River supports the most viable subpopulation among coastal rivers of the Gulf of Mexico and was estimated at 7,650 individuals older than age two (Sulak and Clugston 1999). The subpopulation estimate for Gulf sturgeon older than age two in the Choctawhatchee River ranges from 1,700â3,000 fish, while subpopulation estimates  in the Apalachicola, Pascagoula and Pearl rivers range from 50â350 fish (Lorio 2000). The number of mature individuals in this range wide population were not estimated but most likely number less than 10,000. Eggs and larvae of Gulf sturgeon have been collected in the Bouie, Escambia/Conecuh, Choctawatchee, Apalachicola and Suwanee rivers (Critical Habitat Ruling). <br/> <br/>Stabile <em>et al</em>. (1996) analyzed <em>A. o. desotoi</em> subpopulations from eight drainages along the Gulf of Mexico for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences among Gulf sturgeon stocks and suggested they displayed region-specific affinities and may exhibit river-specific fidelity. These authors identified five regional or river-specific stocks: (1) Lake Ponchartrain and Pearl River; (2) Pascagoula River; (3) Escambia and Yellow rivers; (4) Choctawhatchee River; and (5) Apalachicola, Ochlockonee, and Suwannee rivers.",Increasing,"<em>A. oxyrinchus</em> occurs in the Atlantic coastal waters of Canada and the United States with spawning rivers in both countries. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> historically ranged along the Canadian and U.S. Atlantic Coast from Labrador to Florida. Though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S.

Though the subspecies was previously listed as also occurring in Mexico, a review of the literature fails to support that contention. A single ""sturgeon"" was reported seen (but not captured) in the Rio Grande River which separates Texas and Mexico. The Gulf sturgeonâs current area of occupancy is spread over 2,500+ river km and 1,500+ km of coastline. However, construction of dams, sills and other water control structures throughout the 20th century severely restricted inland migrations of Gulf sturgeon in many waterways from St. Andrew Bay to the Bogue Chitto River. <br/> <br/>For more information see <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer"">NatureServeâs Explorer database</a>.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997. Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River (Quebec) for subadults of <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em>, and in the Saint John River (New Brunswick) for larger fish. Also, a single fisherman is licensed on the Shubenacadie River in Nova Scotia. The St. Lawrence fishery was limited in 1997 to a quota of 6,015 fish - about 60 tons (Caron and Trembly 1997). Other regulations here include a maximum size limit of 1.5 m during a season extending from 1 May to 30 September. <br/> <br/>Peak landings on the Saint John River were 44 metric tones (mt) in 1988 but have declined in recent years to 10â14 mt. Only nine licensed fishermen remained in the St. John fishery in 1997. They were authorized to fish no more than 2,800 m of gill net with minimum mesh size of 33 cm. Minimum allowable size of sturgeon on the St. John is 120 cm and the season is closed during 1â30 June to protect spawners. Canadian authorities have expressed to U.S. authorities that these harvest levels are sustainable and do not damage the stocks (USFWS and NMFS 1998). A private aquaculture activity also occurs in New Brunswick with eggs and progeny produced from wild-caught adult sturgeon. Except for a few hundred live juveniles, most international trade in <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> in the late 1990s has been meat (2â34 mt/year) from Canada to the U.S. (CITES data). <br/> <br/>No commercial or sport fishing for Atlantic sturgeon is allowed in territorial waters of the U.S. Atlantic Coast. The management authority for this species is the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and their amendment to the 1990 Fishery Management Plan (ASMFC 1998) requires (1) no possession allowed in the 15 Atlantic states until at least 20 year-classes reach breeding age (30â40 years); (2) annual reporting of by-catch and by-catch mortality; (3) urges habitat monitoring and improvements as well as research and genetics analysis; and (4) places certain restrictions on sturgeon culture for market production and restocking.  In addition to the ASMFC action, the Secretary of Commerce has closed all U.S. Atlantic coastal EEZ waters to harvest of Atlantic sturgeon. <br/> <br/>The recent USFWS-NMFS joint status review for Atlantic sturgeon determined that listing this species as threatened or endangered under the U.S. ESA is not warranted at this time. Atlantic sturgeon are widespread and several subpopulations could be considered relatively abundant. However, because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery, USFWS has designated Atlantic sturgeon as a ""candidate species"" for possible future ESA listing and NMFS lists it as a ""species of concern"". <br/> <br/>In 1991, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> was listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Since then considerable work has been accomplished to better define life history and behavior and to determine habitats important to each life stage, population status, genetic assessment and fish culture. A recovery and management plan for Gulf sturgeon was completed in 1995 (USFWS and GSMFC 1995). This plan identifies state and federal actions necessary to rebuild populations to levels that would allow de-listing of the subspecies. In 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service officially designated ""critical habitat"" for this species, including 2,783 river kilometers and 6,042 square km of estuarine and marine habitat. <br/> <br/>With federal protection under the ESA and intensive permitting and consultation requirements for all water-related projects and discharges - especially in areas designated to be critical habitat - it is believed that <em>A. o. desotoi</em> population declines will be halted and reversed.<br/><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

This decline is ongoing and is likely to result in extinction of this species, projected to occur within the period 2020-2050 if nothing changes.</p>  <p>The Common Hamster's range has declined in almost all European countries. Local and regional extirpations and extinctions have occurred in 13 European countries and in both the European and Asiatic parts of Russia. These include nearly 67% of the range states for this species. The decline does not affect only West European countries, but also affects the global range with declines in Russia and the eastern part of its range evidenced. From the previous assessment in 2016 there has been an estimated decline in the species area of occupancy of 226,835 kmÂ² and a 468,634 kmÂ² decline in its extent of occurrence.</p><br/><p></p>","Its original habitat was fertile steppe and grassland, but it has successfully spread into a variety of anthropogenic habitats including meadows, croplands (especially cereals), and field edges, road verges and scrubby fallow areas on farms. In eastern parts of its range it is found quite often in gardens and orchards, in close proximity to human habitation. It is more abundant in these man-made habitats than it is in natural grassland. It prefers relatively deep, heavy soils, in which it digs extensive burrows. Its diet mainly consists of the green parts of plants and seeds, supplemented by invertebrates and, occasionally, small vertebrates. At high densities it is considered an agricultural pest in some areas (Nechay 2000).","The causes of the global decline are complex, are not fully understood yet, and there are many hypotheses attempting to explain the breakdown of the species. Research to identify the most important factors driving this decline is urgently needed.  The decline in Western Europe has been attributed to a combination of persecution and agricultural intensification. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive building of industrial estates, alongside the improvement of road networks and infrastructure, are severely disturbing natural population dynamics and lead to highly endangered âisland populationsâ.  Habitat fragmentation also causes loss of genetic diversity (Banaszek <em>et al</em>. 2011; Banaszek and Ziomek 2012; La Haye <em>et al</em>. 2012; Neuman <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2005; Reiners <em>et al</em>. 2014). Agricultural intensificationâspecifically the loss of perennial crops, the lack of crop diversity, large scale monocultural farming, and the use of pesticidesâare suspected to have a negative impact. Moreover, it was shown in Alsace that body mass of the hamsters at emergence from hibernation decreased by 20% in the last 70 years. It was suggested that maize monocultures and climate change have such adverse effects on body mass (Tissier <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> The current change in agricultural practices in Central and Eastern Europe is a real threat in the near future (Hegyeli <em>et al</em>. 2015). In former times, Common Hamster was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops. The hamsters were also trapped for the fur trade (Nechay 2000). A recent analysis of reproduction parameters revealed a global decrease in the number of litters, embryos and newborns to such an extent that the populations potentially might shrink by 50% each year. The reasons for reproduction breakdown most probably are related to climate change, light pollution, or fur trapping in the past (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).  Light pollution is an often underestimated threat. It acts on the physiology and behaviour of the species through endocrine and neurobiological processes which affect, amongst others, reproduction in birds and mammals (for a review see Navara and Nelson 2007, Gaston <em>et al</em>. 2013). For the Common Hamster there is not only a spatial coincidence between highly light polluted areas and areas with the strongest decline but also a temporal coincidence between the period of decline and increasing light intensities (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Moreover, light exposure during only two winter nights shifted the onset of its reproductive phase by 3-4 weeks (Monecke <em>et al</em>. 2010). The fact that, nevertheless, some populations are doing quite well in a few cities is not a contradiction: good food availability and rain-sheltered areas within a town might override the negative effect of light pollution in these populations.","<em>Cricetus cricetus</em> has undergone severe range and population declines in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, and now has a highly fragmented distribution in these areas. The decline of the Common Hamster's range and numbers covers its whole distribution range (see Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016 for detailed analysis with maps). Extirpations and extinction on local and regional scales have occurred in a number of countries including Belgium, The Netherlands, France, Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia (Ambros <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bihari 2003, Demyanchik 2004, Ziomek and Banaszek 2007, Tkadlec <em>et </em>al. 2012, Sidorov <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rusin <em>et al</em>. 2013, Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is extinct in Switzerland (Hediger 1944, Mohr 1954, no recent records) and most probably in Georgia, where it was present in one locality (Vinogradov and Gromov 1952, Bukhnikashvili and Kandaurov 2004). To the best knowledge of the assessors, it was never present in Luxembourg which was listed as country of occurrence in the previous assessment.<br/><br/>In general, decline was shown in each country where monitoring of the species was performed. The relative occurrence of the Common Hamster before and after 1970 was compared in Russian, Belarus and Ukrainian provinces, and Moldova. Before 1970, the Common Hamster was abundant in 28 provinces, common in 37 and rare in 20. Today, the species is abundant only in eight and common in 27 provinces, but it is rare in 42 and extinct in eight provinces. Moreover, the species' range is becoming or is already fragmented, due to it vanishing from more than 75% of its range in Central and Eastern Europe. There are only seven fragments in eastern part of the range where the species is common or abundant: two are in Ukraine, one in Caucasus, two in Volga and Ural area and two in Siberia. Nevertheless, the most important fact is that population decline and fragmentation in general concerns the whole eastern range (Surov <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Cricetus cricetus</em> has a large global range, extending from Western Europe, through Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Kazakhstan, reaching as far East as the Yenisey river (Asian Russia). In Europe, it occurs from Belgium, the Netherlands and Eastern France (Alsace) in the West to Russia in the East, and from central Germany, Poland and Russia in the North to Bulgaria in the South (Panteleyev 1998, Weinhold 1999). It is found from sea level to 650 m (Nechay 2000).","<p>In the past the Common Hamsters were intensively used in fur trade. Tens of millions individuals were harvested annually, but this hunting pressure had ended by 1970s in most of the species' range. Hunting continues only in Hungary (on a very limited scale).</p>",Terrestrial,"The species is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. Specific conservation recommendations to improve the status of the species in Western Europe are detailed in Stubbe and Stubbe (1998), Nechay (2000), Weinhold (2009) and various other authors. These focus on subsidizing farmers to manage agricultural habitats appropriately, to restore key habitat elements, such as lucerne fields, offering cover and food after harvest, and minimizing the use of pesticides.<br/> <br/> In recent years reintroductions have been carried out in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany and this conservation measure seems the most successful so far as it stops local population decrease.<br/> <br/> The Standing Committee of the Bern Convention adopted an action plan for the conservation of the European Hamster in 2009 (Weinhold 2009), recommending the urgent need to update population data and trends in the Eastern part of the range as well as the preparation of protection plans in those countries. Conservation measures are currently carried out and monitoring of population trends takes place regularly only in Western Europe (Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Germany and Austria). These are four out of 18 countries belonging to the range of <em>Cricetus cricetus</em> where it is extant. Monitoring of the species was performed in several other countries (i.e., in Poland, Czech Republic and Ukraine, partially in Belarus, Slovakia, Romania and Russia).

However, these threats have ceased and the population may now begin to increase. Given the species's longevity it is retained as Near Threatened on the basis of the past declines. <p></p> <p></p>","Breeding takes place in burrows in sandy soil and rocky crevices. Birds attend colonies for at least 10 months of the year, arriving nocturnally to reduce predation by Western Gulls <em>Larus occidentalis </em>(Keitt <em>et al</em>. 2004) and ravens. Eggs are laid in March and hatching begins in early May (Keitt 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","On Natividad, in the past, predation by c.20 feral cats reduced the population causing &gt;1,000 recorded deaths per month prior to their eradication which reduced mortality to less than 100 per month (Keitt <em>et al. undated,</em><em>&#160;</em>2002). Road construction and the establishment of a small fishing community have decreased breeding habitat and burrows (Keitt 1998), and trampled burrows and lights continue to cause some mortality (Keitt and Albores-Barajas <em>unpublished data</em>). Introduced rodents in Isla Rasa, in the Gulf of California, have been successfully eradicated, but no population monitoring has been carried out since first nesting record occurred in 2010 (Velarde&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Predation by Western gulls and common raven can be easily observed both on chicks and adults, while eggs and young chicks are occasionally predated by white-tail antelope squirrel, <em>Ammospermophilus leucurus</em> (Albores-Barajas and Garcia <em>unpublished data</em>). The Guadalupe population is thought to be predated by cats (B. Tershy and B. Keitt <em>in litt.</em> 1999). It is possible that cat predation has caused the extirpation, or at the very least, significantly reduced populations of this species from the main island of Guadalupe (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). In 2003, remains were found on cliffs at the southwest edge of Guadalupe in excellent potential nesting habitat. It is not known if these observations indicate breeding or prospecting birds. The presence of habitat inaccessible to cats provides hope that this species may still breed in small remnant populations on the main island of Guadalupe (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). Calls from prospecting adults in the cliffs of Melpomene Arroyo, indicate birds are readily available to recolonize the main island in the absence of cat predation (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). On all islands, introduced herbivores (donkeys, goats, sheep and rabbits) have caused erosion (reducing soil for burrows), trampled burrows, and destroyed vegetation, and rabbits may have displaced birds from burrows (Keitt 1998, B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999). Gill-net fisheries may cause some mortality (Carboneras 1992d). The human population at Natividad Island has continued to increase, with more houses built over the last few years. Although the houses are concentrated on the town area, there is more human presence on the island. Also, from time to time there are mountain biking races organized on the island and the track runs through the colony. Although the bikes tend to stay within the race track, it might be that this causes some human disturbance to the burrowing seabirds.&#160;<p></p>","The total population estimated in 1998-1999 was around 80,000 pairs, and therefore 160,000 mature individuals. In 2016, aerial photography and GIS were used to count during the breeding season the total number of occupied and unoccupied burrows in Natividad Island. The counts gave a figure of 37,858 (Â±8510 SE) breeding pairs, and therefore about 75,600 individuals. This figure was based on the initial occupancy of burrows on February 2016. Of the initial number of occupied burrows, there were 4,543 (about 12% of the burrows occupied) which were initially occupied but later abandoned by the birds (Albores-Barajas <em>et al. in press</em>).<br/><br/>Counts produced much lower numbers than previous estimates. It is likely that the methods used in 1998-99 overestimated the population size. The author extrapolated counts of nests in selected areas to the whole surface of the island used by birds without considering that there were large areas without any burrow. During the last survey, thanks to aerial photography, it was possible to precisely count all the burrows which were actually present (Albores-Barajas <em>et al. in press</em>). The total number of burrows counted, including occupied and abandoned burrows, was 56,395 with a relatively low occupancy (between 75% and 50% depending on the area).<br/><br/>Between 2014 and early 2016 the birds on Natividad were also affected by the presence of a wire fence next to the local rubbish dump and on the trajectory used by bird when moving from colony to sea. Several carcasses were found during the survey in February 2016. When the situation was analysed using thermal cameras, it was observed that at least 20 individuals collided with the fence every day, resulting in seven dead individuals/day. This mortality rate was estimated equivalent to the predation of five cats (Albores-Barajas<em> et al. in press</em>). The fence was immediately removed after the observations when it was communicated to the local community and to the Biosphere Reserve.",Unknown,"<p><em>Puffinus opisthomelas</em> breeds on six islands or small islets (including Guadalupe -and its islets-, San Benito- East, Middle and West- and Natividad), off the Pacific coast of <strong>Mexico</strong>.

Where surveys in the late 1990s estimated 114,000 burrows (Keitt et al. 2003), only 56,000 burrows were recorded in 2016, however it is considered that the methods used in 1998-1999 overestimated the population size (Albores-Barajas <em>et al. in press</em>).

119333622,3897,Caretta caretta,Vulnerable,A2b,2017,2015-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em><strong>Rationale<br/></strong></em>The global population of the Loggerhead Turtle (<em>Caretta caretta</em>) comprises 10 subpopulations (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) that vary widely in population size, geographic range, and population trends, and are the appropriate units for assessment of global conservation status for this species (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). As such, assessments have been completed for each of the 10 subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). At the global level, both geographic distribution and population size are much larger than required to qualify for a threatened category. The available long-term series of nest counts (used as an index of population abundance) show an important decrease in the past (47%). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle is considered as Vulnerable under current IUCN Red List Criteria (criterion A2b). The previous listing, published in 1996, was Endangered under criterion A1bd (Marine Turtle Specialist Group 1996).<br/><br/>Results indicate that the Loggerhead Turtle, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation according to any Red List criteria. However, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Loggerhead Turtle population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by IUCN Red List Categories), but also in the criteria under which the individual subpopulations qualified for a threatened category (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). For these reasons, the subpopulation-level assessments for the Loggerhead Turtle should be given priority in evaluating the true global conservation status of this species. This conclusion follows the precedent for other long-lived, widely distributed species, including the Leatherback Turtle (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><em><strong>Justification<br/></strong></em>The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy exceeds the thresholds for criterion B, and the population size exceeds the thresholds for criteria C and D. Regarding criterion A, trends were estimated on time series datasets with â¥10 years of data of nesting activities (nest counts) at 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations out of 10 (North West Atlantic, Mediterranean, South West Atlantic, North West Indian, South West Indian, North Pacific). These six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current annual nests globally (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). The analysis revealed different trends for different subpopulations, with an overall -47% population decrease relative to population size three generations ago, which qualifies for the Vulnerable category (under criterion A2). The species trend at a global scale is basically determined by the two most abundant subpopulations, the North West Atlantic and the North West Indian, which altogether comprise about 75% of the current annual nests. They showed positive and negative trends, respectively. The other four subpopulations for which trends could be calculated show positive trends. For the remaining four subpopulations (comprising about 10% of the current annual nests; North East Atlantic, North East Indian, South East Indian, South Pacific), current trends are unclear, however past negative trends are known or suspected at least for the South Pacific and the North East Atlantic subpopulations respectively.<br/>&#160;<br/>The overall scenario suggests that, on the basis of the current knowledge, the extinction of the species at the global level is highly unlikely to occur in the short and medium term. However, the global status of the species in terms of distribution, number of subpopulations, genetic variability, regional ecological roles, and vulnerability, could change dramatically from the past and current situations. For this reason, the global assessment cannot be considered as an indicator of the true conservation status of the species, and priority should be given to the subpopulation assessments.<br/><br/><em><strong>Assessment Procedure:</strong></em><br/><u>Criterion A</u><br/>For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (National Research Council 2010).<br/><br/>To apply criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of the Loggerhead, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 45 years (see the Habitats and Ecology section below). For criterion A, data from three generations ago (~135 years) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e., assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtlesâwith generation lengths of 30 years or moreâare obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for a review). Abundance data from ~135 years ago are not available for Loggerheads anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations ago (~135 years, one generation estimated 45 years; see Habitats and Ecology section below) was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation. A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another sea turtle species, the Leatherback Turtle (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013) and of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply criterion A we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations. For the Loggerhead global and subpopulation assessments we only considered time series datasets of â¥10 years.<br/><br/>For the global Loggerhead population, we considered time series datasets of 10-50 years, from 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations (see the individual subpopulation assessments). The index nesting sites included in the analysis are assumed to be representative of their subpopulations, and these six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current total annual nests (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>The assessment under criterion A was conducted in three steps, as follows. Please see the separate subpopulation assessments for further details.<br/><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> We estimated past trends for each of the six individual subpopulations. Specifically, from one past and one recent abundance values (each representing the annual average of five year nest counts) we calculated overall trends (past-present) for each index nesting sites within subpopulations, and then we calculated overall subpopulation past trends for each subpopulation (criteria A1-A2).</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The past and present total abundance values of the six subpopulations (obtained from Step 2) were summed and from these totals the overall population change (past-present) was calculated (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material). </li></ul>Five of the above six subpopulations showed positive trends and one showed a negative trend. Altogether, they showed a negative trend (-47%). The overall negative trend depended on the negative trend of one subpopulation (North West Indian) where criterion A2 was appropriate â i.e. the causes of reduction may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible. Therefore, the overall trend of the six subpopulations was assessed against criterion A2. The past estimated trend was above the threshold for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 (30% decline) but below the threshold for the Endangered category (50% decline). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle qualifies for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 and the applicable subcriterion is (b), an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (counts of nests or tracks).<br/><br/>Although these trends consider only 6 of 10 subpopulations, these subpopulations with sufficient available data account for about 90% of the current global population abundance (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, these trends likely reflect the complete global trend and represent the best information available about the global population trend. Similarly, the global Leatherback Turtle assessment used only five of seven subpopulations to estimate global trends due to lack of sufficient data for two subpopulations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><u>Criterion B</u><br/>Since the population area extends over entire oceans around the world, the extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the threatened category threshold (20,000 kmÂ²). The area of occupancy (AOO) for sea turtles is identified with the nesting beach habitat, which represents the smallest habitat for a critic life stage. Since the appropriate scale for AOO is a grid 2x2 km, the threshold of 2,000 kmÂ² corresponds to 1,000 km of linear coastal tract, which is easily exceeded (by orders of magnitude) by the total length of nesting beaches globally. In conclusion, the global population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion B.<br/><br/><u>Criterion C</u><br/>To apply criterion C, the number of adults is needed and can be derived from the number of nests per year with the following formula:&#160; Adults = Nests * Nests per female<sup>-1</sup> * Remigration interval * Female proportion<sup>-1</sup>. With a current estimate of annual number of nests of about 200,000, for any reasonable value of the other parameters the population would easily exceed the threshold of 10,000 adults required to qualify for a threatened category under criterion C.<br/><br/><u>Criterion D</u><br/>The number of mature individuals (see criterion C) and AOO value (see criterion B) exceeded the respective thresholds. In conclusion, the population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion D.<br/><br/><u>Criterion E</u><br/>Although population viability analyses (PVA) were attempted at subpopulation level (Conant <em>et al</em>. 2009, Van Houtan 2011), in most cases they were not suitable for criterion E under this assessment. No PVA has been attempted at species level and such an approach would also be questionable because the subpopulations are independent units by definition.<br/><br/><strong><em>Sources of Uncertainty</em></strong><br/>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (National Research Council 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (National Research Council 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Loggerheads, including age at maturity, generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, remigration intervals, etc.). These values can vary within and among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends. However, we have reduced this source of uncertainty by using in the analyses those data sets obtained though standardized monitoring.<br/><br/>For the trend analyses (criterion A) we used data from index rookeries from six populations out of 10. Possible negative past trends associated to high past abundances in the other four subpopulations not included in the analysis could have changed the final result of the assessment (past trends, criterion A2), if such information was available.<br/><br/>For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).","The Loggerhead Turtle nests on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the temperate and subtropical regions worldwide. Like most sea turtles, Loggerhead Turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (Bolten and Witherington 2003). Upon leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Bolten and Witherington 2003, Putman and Mansfield 2015). After 4-19 years in the oceanic zone, Loggerheads recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in benthic prey or epipelagic prey where they forage and grow until maturity at 10â39 years (Avens and Snover 2013). Upon attaining sexual maturity Loggerhead Turtles undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas at remigration intervals of one to several years with a mean of 2.5â3 years for females (Schroeder <em>et al</em>. 2003) while males would have a shorter remigration interval (e.g., Hays <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wibbels <em>et al</em>. 1990). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Plotkin 2003). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (Bolten and Witherington 2003).<br/><br/><strong><em>Generation length</em></strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population (i.e., older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual) and care should be taken to avoid underestimation (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Although different subpopulations may have different generation length, since this information is limited we adopted the same value for all the subpopulations, taking care to avoid underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).<br/><br/>Loggerheads attain maturity at 10-39 years (Avens and Snover 2013), and we considered here 30 years to be equal or greater than the average age at maturity. Data on reproductive longevity in Loggerheads are limited, but are becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches. Tagging studies have documented reproductive histories up to 28 years in the North Western Atlantic Ocean (Mote Marine Laboratory, unpubl. data), up to 18 years in the South Western Indian Ocean (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013), up to 32 years in the South Western Atlantic Ocean (Projeto Tamar unpubl. data), and up to 37 years in the South Western Pacific Ocean, where females nesting for 20-25 years are common (C. Limpus, pers. comm). We considered 15 years to be equal or greater than the average reproductive longevity. Therefore, we considered here 45 years to be equal or greater than the average generation length, therefore avoiding underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).","Threats to Loggerheads vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Loggerheads, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011) as:<br/><ol><li>Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;</li><li>Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e., consumption, commercial products);</li><li>Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc;</li><li>Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e., through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (for example fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;</li><li>Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).</li><li>The relative impacts of individual threats to all Loggerhead subpopulations were assessed by by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Loggerheads globally, followed by coastal development and human consumption of eggs, meat, or other products. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Loggerheadsâand other marine turtle speciesâshould be a high priority for future conservation efforts. </li></ol>More detailed information at regional level can found in the specific subpopulation assessments.","Loggerheads are a single species globally comprising 10 biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) â hereafter subpopulations - which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. Regional management units are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are 10 Loggerhead subpopulations: NorthWest Atlantic Ocean, North East Atlantic Ocean, South West Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North East Indian Ocean, North West Indian Ocean, South East Indian Ocean, South West Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010)  (shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).<br/><br/>Total population size is unknown. The most common proxy for population abundance in sea turtles is the annual number of nests. A total of about 200,000 clutches are laid annually by the 10 subpopulations altogether (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Considering a range of 3 to 5.5 clutches per female, the above value would correspond to approximately 36,000-67,000 nesting females annually.",Decreasing,"The Loggerhead Turtle is globally distributed throughout the subtropical and temperate regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).","Loggerhead Turtles and their eggs are taken for human use (i.e., consumption and commercial products).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Loggerhead Turtles are afforded legislative protection under a number of treaties and laws (Wold 2002). Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). A partial list of the International Instruments that benefit Loggerhead Turtles includes the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA), the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection, the Memorandum of Agreement on the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.<br/><br/>As a result of these designations and agreements, many of the intentional impacts directed at sea turtles have been lessened: harvest of eggs and adults has been slowed at several nesting areas through nesting beach conservation efforts and an increasing number of community-based initiatives are in place to slow the take of turtles in foraging areas. In regard to incidental take, the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices has proved to be beneficial in some areas, primarily in the United States and South and Central America (National Research Council 1990). Guidelines are available to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations in coastal and high seas fisheries (FAO 2009). However, despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world. In most areas, the lack of effective monitoring in pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the supporting ecosystems of long-lived Loggerhead Turtles.<br/><br/>More detailed information at regional level can be found in the specific subpopulation assessments.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the worldâs most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 kmÂ²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, FrkoviÄ <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 kmÂ²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5â15 bears per 1,000 kmÂ²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, FrkoviÄ <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130â220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 kmÂ² and 2,200 kmÂ² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21â29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of GÃ¤rdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (â1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 kmÂ² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 kmÂ² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The rate of decline is probably underestimated because a period of only 25 years was considered and other sources of non-natural mortality, including other fisheries, were not incorporated into the analysis. The causes of the suspected population decline have not ceased. On the contrary, fishing effort has increased, at least in some areas in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian Government established regulations for gillnet fisheries that included maximum allowable net lengths and several categories of no-fishing areas. However, there is evidence that the level of Franciscana mortality in southern and southeastern Brazil remains high. The numbers of Franciscanas killed in Brazil in gillnets and found washed ashore each year remains in the order of several hundred which is not different from the numbers observed in years that preceded the regulations (e.g., Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2016; Cremer <em>et al.</em> 2016, E.R. Secchi, unpubl. data). The bycatch is also high in Uruguay and Argentina, where estimates of annual mortality are a few hundred Franciscanas (Capozzo <em>et al.</em> 2007, Negri <em>et al.</em> 2012, Szephegyi <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/></p>","Although sometimes described as a âriver dolphinâ, the Franciscana does not occur in freshwater habitats. The species is generally found in turbid coastal waters, but also inhabits clear waters as well as marine areas associated with islands and rocky shores (Pinedo <em>et al</em>. 1989, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2009). Franciscanas are found mainly in the marine environment and only occasionally in estuaries (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2009) and one inland bay (Cremer and SimÃµes-Lopes 2008). They are relatively common in the Uruguayan part of the La Plata River estuary (Praderi 1986). Franciscanas are primarily coastal, inhabiting waters beyond the surf zone and out to the 30 or 50 m isobath, depending on the region. For example, in FMAs III and IV they occur in waters up to 50 m deep (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2010), while in FMAs I and II they appear to be restricted to waters inshore of the 25 or 30 m isobath. Franciscana density decreases with distance from the coast, although the rate and degree of the decrease vary according the width of the continental shelf (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, D. Danilewicz, unpub. data).<br/><br/>Franciscanas apparently do not migrate, although seasonal inshoreâoffshore movements have been documented in some areas (Bordino <em>et al</em>. 1999, Bordino 2002). Movements of 70-90 km along the coastline have been recorded for satellite-tagged individuals in Argentina (Wells <em>et al</em>. 2013). Predation by both large sharks and Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) has been documented (Praderi 1985, Ott and Danilewicz 1996, Santos and Netto 2005).<br/><br/>Franciscanas feed on several species of shallow-water fish (e.g., sciaenids, engraulids, gadids, batrachoids, trichiurids and carangids), cephalopods, and crustaceans (Brownell 1989, Di Beneditto and Ramos 2001, Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2002, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002, Troina <em>et al</em>. 2016). Their coastal marine habitat is typically characterized by continental run-off with high discharge of high-nutrient river flows (e.g., Patos Lagoon [Lagoa dos Patos] in RS and the La Plata River [RÃ­o de la Plata] in Argentina and Uruguay). Juvenile sciaenids, the most important prey of Franciscanas, are typically associated with continental runoff and the influence of subtropical shelf waters (Crespo 2009).","The main threat to the species is incidental mortality in gillnet fisheries (there are no reports of direct exploitation of Franciscanas), which has been observed since at least the mid 1960s (Van Erp 1969). In the 1960s, the bycatch in Uruguay alone (at two villages) was as high as 1,500-2,000 animals (Brownell and Ness 1969, Pilleri 1971), but changes in the fisheriesâ target species resulted in a significant decrease in the bycatch in the 1980s (Crespo <em>et al.</em> 1986, Praderi 1997). Bycatch estimates in the early 2000s totaled at least 2,900 animals per year in all management stocks combined (e.g., Ott <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b), but these numbers are thought to be underestimated to an unknown extent, primarily due to: (1) captures in other non-monitored types of fisheries (e.g., active gillnetting, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 1997; trawling, Szephegyi <em>et al.</em> 2015); (2) under-reporting of bycatch by fishermen; and (3) dolphins captured sometimes falling from the net during retrieval (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b). Annual bycatch is believed to be higher in FMA III with estimates of 1,300 animals/year (Ott <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b, 2004) and much higher in some years (Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013), followed by FMA IV: 500-800 individuals/year (Bordino and Albareda 2005), FMA II: &gt; 700 /year (Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2002, IWC 2005), and FMA Ib: &gt; 110/year (Di Beneditto 2003). These annual mortality estimates suggest that bycatch levels continue to be unsustainable (Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2012; Crespo <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zerbini <em>et al.</em> 2010, Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/> <br/> Stomach contents of Franciscanas from Rio Grande do Sul have included many kinds of debris: discarded fishing gear such as pieces of nylon net (17% of 36 stomachs), ""cellophane"" (or some other type of synthetic packaging material), and plastic fragments (6%) (Bassoi 1997). This problem has also been reported in northern Argentina, where cellophane, fishing debris, and plastic were found in 45%, 32% and 16% of the examined stomachs, respectively (Bastida <em>et al</em>. 2000, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002). The effects of such debris ingestion on health status of individual Franciscanas have not been assessed, and the subpopulation or population-level implications are uncertain. Debris ingestion is a new threat that did not exist, at least in Uruguay, in the early 1970s (R.L. Brownell, Jr., pers. comm., August 2017).<br/> <br/> Other known or potential threats include various forms of habitat degradation (e.g., overfishing; destruction of the benthic community and bycatch of small sciaenid fishâmain Franciscana preyâby trawling; and chemical and acoustic pollution) (e.g., Bassoi and Secchi 2000, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002, RodrÃ­guez <em>et al</em>. 2002, LaÃ­lson-Brito <em>et al</em>. 2007, Yogui <em>et al.</em> 2010, Holz 2014).","Based on genetic, morphological, distribution, and population parameters, Secchi <em>et al</em>. (2003a) proposed four provisional management units (Franciscana Management Areas, or FMAs) with the following ranges:&#160; FMA I - coastal waters of EspÃ­rito Santo (ES) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) States, Brazil; FMA II - SÃ£o Paulo (SP), ParanÃ¡ (PR), and Santa Catarina (SC) States, Brazil; FMA III - coastal waters of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, southern Brazil, and Uruguay; and FMA IV - coastal waters of Argentina, including the provinces of Buenos Aires and Rio Negro (only occasional in as far south as Chubut).<br/><br/>Since the study of Secchi <em>et al</em>. (2003a), new genetic and morphological data have indicated the potential for subpopulation structure throughout the range of the Franciscana (LÃ¡zaro <em>et al</em>. 2004; Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010; VÃ©ras 2011; Barbato <em>et al</em>. 2012; Costa-Urrutia <em>et al</em>. 2012; Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014; Negri <em>et al</em>. 2015; Gariboldi <em>et al</em>. 2015; Ott <em>et al</em>. 2015), leading to the development of new sub-divisions within each FMA (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, because (1) the degree of differentiation within the various FMAs was highly variable, (2) some studies were based only on mitochondrial DNA data, and (3) there is currently no consensus on threshold levels of gene flow above which management units should be adopted, recent refinements in Franciscana subpopulation structure were limited to regions where the greatest levels of genetic difference were observed (Anonymous 2015). In this sense, FMA I was considered an Evolutionarily Significant Unit and split into two distinct management units (FMA Ia and FMA Ib, Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014), a division also supported by well-known gaps in the distribution of the species, one between SP and RJ and another in ES (Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2012). In addition, the boundary between FMA II and FMA III was moved about 250 km to the north and currently lies at the central coast of SC State (Ott, 2002, VÃ©ras 2011, Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ott <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>There is no range-wide abundance estimate for the species, but estimates have been calculated for a portion or the whole of individual FMAs. <br/><ul><li>Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted aerial surveys in ES (FMA Ia) and RJ (FMA Ib) in 2011. No on-effort sightings were recorded in FMA Ia, despite relatively large survey effort, suggesting that the population of Franciscanas in ES is small, a hypothesis further supported by the very low genetic diversity of this stock (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014). Abundance of Franciscanas in FMA Ib was estimated at nearly 2,000 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.46), indicating that this is the smallest and the one with the lowest density among all FMAs for which estimates are available. <br/></li><li>Abundance in FMA II was estimated at 8,500 individuals (CV 0.34) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2010) in 2008/9. This estimate is considered to be biased low because habitat offshore of the 30 m isobath was not surveyed. Within FMA II, there are also abundance estimates for Baia da Babitonga (Babitonga Bay) in SC, where a possibly isolated population of Franciscanas occurs (Cremer <em>et al</em>. 2012). Boat-based line transect surveys estimated 50 animals in the early 2000s (CV 0.29, Cremer and SimÃµes-Lopes 2008) and 55 individuals in 2011 (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2011), indicating no evidence for a change in the number of Franciscanas within Babitonga Bay over a 10-year period.</li><li>Recent surveys in FMA III have been conducted only within the Brazilian portion (RS State) and the estimates were 6,800 (CV 0.32) in 2004 (Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2010) and nearly 10,000 dolphins (CV 0.20) in 2014 (D. Danilewicz <em>et al</em>., unpub. data). Because the survey methods and data analysis between these two estimates differed, it is not appropriate to conclude that the higher estimate in 2014 represents an increase in abundance in RS. Surveys to estimate Franciscana abundance have never been conducted in Uruguay. <br/></li><li>Aerial surveys conducted in Argentina (FMA IV) in 2003-2004 estimated a population of nearly 15,000 individuals (CV 0.42, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010). This estimate is believed to be negatively biased because it was not corrected for perception bias and because density estimated for offshore areas (depths greater than 30 m) was not extrapolated to non-surveyed areas.</li></ul>Population viability analysis using estimates of abundance, fisheries-related incidental mortality, and rates of population growth from the early 2000s suggested that levels of bycatch were not sustainable in all FMAs and that Franciscanas in FMAs II, III and IV would decline by at least 30% in 25 years (Secchi and Fletcher 2004, Secchi 2006). These analyses led to the previous Red List classification of the Franciscana as Vulnerable. The modelling exercise conducted by Secchi and Fletcher (2004) and Secchi (2006) is considered to underestimate the risk of decline of Franciscanas, because estimates of bycatch were believed to be biased low in some areas. In fact, most recent data on bycatch (see the <em>Threats</em> section below) indicate that the numbers caught annually in FMAs II and IV are roughly twice as high (e.g., Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bordino and Albareda 2004, IWC 2005) as the values used in the projections by Secchi (2006). Abundance estimates obtained from the mid 2000s to early 2010s suggest that bycatch levels are still unsustainable in FMAs Ib, II, and IV where the annual removals range from 3-6% of the estimated population sizes (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no estimates of bycatch or abundance for Franciscanas in FMA Ia.",Decreasing,"Franciscanas inhabit shallow coastal waters (and they sporadically enter the estuary of the La Plata River [Rio de la Plata]) of subtropical and temperate regions of the western South Atlantic Ocean (Crespo 2009, Secchi 2014). They are found only along the east coast of South America (Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina), from the northern Golfo San Matias, central Argentina (<em>ca</em> 42Â°10'S), to EspÃ­rito Santo, southeastern Brazil (18Â°25'S) (Siciliano 1994, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species is not distributed continuously throughout its range. Surveys (including beach and aerial surveys, museum specimens, interviews with local people) indicate that Franciscanas are extremely rare or absent in two northern areas: (1) between central and southern Rio de Janeiro State comprising nearly 300 km of coastline and (2) in southern EspÃ­rito Santo State comprising approximately 150 km of coastline (Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2002, Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2012). The reasons for these gaps are unclear, but the speciesâ preference for shallow and productive waters (Brownell 1989, Pinedo <em>et al</em>. 1989, Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2009) suggests that depth and the narrowness of the continental shelf influence habitat selection (Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002).",,Marine,The Franciscana is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Furthermore, the species meets criterion A for Vulnerable under the subcriteria A2, A3 and A4 because a reduction of at least 30% over three generations (60 years) is suspected in the past (A2), in a time period including both the past and the future (A4), and in the future alone (A3) based primarily on (c) a decline in habitat quality and (d) actual and potential levels of exploitation (in the form of bycatch in nets). In all three cases, the causes of the reduction have not ceased, are not well understood and may be irreversible.</p>  Although the species may not meet any of the criteria for Endangered at this time, it is likely to do so under C2a(i) in the near future because: 1) the number of mature individuals is or will be fewer than 2,500, 2) the reductions in population size either have been or will be large and pervasive enough to cause a net reduction for the entire species of at least 20% over a period of 2 generations, and 3) the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation across the range either is or will be â¤ 250 individuals.","<p>Studies to date indicate that Snubfin Dolphins occur mainly within shallow, protected coastal and estuarine habitats (Parra <em>et al. </em>2002, 2006b; Parra 2006, Allen <em>et al. </em>2012, Palmer <em>et al. </em>2014b, Brown <em>et al. </em>2016). A study conducted in far northern Queensland indicated that Snubfin Dolphins occurred mostly in waters less than 15 m deep, within 10 km of the coast, and no more than 20 km from the nearest river mouth (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006b). In Cleveland Bay, Snubfin Dolphins preferred shallow water &lt; 2 m deep and shallow areas with seagrass beds (Parra 2006). Similarly, in Keppel Bay the dolphinsâ core area of use coincided with the Fitzroy River estuary (Cagnazzi <em>et al. </em>2013b). Within this range, Snubfin Dolphins used shallow (2â5 m), shallow subtidal (5â10 m), and moderate-depth (10â15 m) habitat more frequently than expected by chance. In contrast, intertidal (0â2 m) and deeper water (15â20 m) were used less frequently than expected by chance (Cagnazzi <em>et al. </em>2013b). Boat-based surveys conducted between Keppel Bay and Cleveland Bay further strengthen the importance of riverine-estuarine systems to Snubfin Dolphins in Queensland. The only resident population of Snubfin Dolphins along 800 km of coastline between Cleveland Bay and Keppel Bay was found at the mouth of the Proserpine River in the Whitsundays (Cagnazzi 2017). </p>  In the Northern Territory, most records of Snubfin Dolphins are from estuaries, tidal rivers and coastal areas within 20 km of river mouths. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, Snubfin Dolphins occur up to 20 km offshore, likely because of the consistently shallow waters of the Gulf, being less than 10 m deep in many regions 20-30 km offshore. Some Snubfin Dolphins have been recorded up to 30â50 km upstream in larger tidal rivers and at least as far as 10 km offshore (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a,b). Studies in Western Australia also indicate Snubfin Dolphins mainly occur in shallow coastal areas (Brown <em>et al. </em>2016).","<strong>General<br/></strong>The biological features discussed above render the Snubfin Dolphin particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic threatening processes, including habitat degradation and modification, accidental captures in gillnets and shark exclusion devices, direct catches, vessel strikes, noise pollution, chemical pollution, prey depletion, disease and climate change. The impact and extent of anthropogenic threats varies across regions, with some subpopulations facing greater threats than others. The most pervasive threats across the speciesâ distribution are habitat degradation and modification, incidental capture in fishing gear and shark control nets, water pollution, climate change and the cumulative impact of these threats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Current threats affecting the population now, and likely to affect the population in future</strong></u><br/><br/><em><strong>Habitat degradation and modification<br/></strong></em>Habitat loss and degradation has been identified among the primary drivers of population declines of large marine animals (Lotze and Worm 2009). Habitat degradation and modification consists of human activities associated with land reclamation, dredging, seismic surveys, drilling, blasting, shipping, and resource extraction that can result in habitat loss and degradation for Snubfin Dolphins. These activities are known to cause local changes in the composition, structure, and function of the coastal and estuarine habitats, through direct removal of habitat (seagrass, mangroves), physical disturbance, sedimentation, increasing commercial and recreational vessel traffic, increasing noise and chemical pollution, and introduction of viral and bacterial pathogens. Such stressors, when combined with the continuing intensification of the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a result of climate change, and the associated fluctuations in sea levels, are likely to reduce the quality of Snubfin Dolphin habitat. For example, recent extensive diebacks (7,400 ha) of mangrove forests in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia and in Mangrove Bay (40 ha) in north Western Australia were associated with prolonged drought, high temperatures, and a low sea-level event (Duke <em>et al</em>. 2017, Lovelock <em>et al</em>. 2017). The individual, as well as the cumulative, effects of the above threats are a cause of concern for the long-term viability of Australiaâs inshore dolphin populations (Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, DOE 2015, Parra and Cagnazzi 2017).<br/><br/>The coastal zone along Snubfin Dolphinsâ range, particularly in northwestern Australia and along the central coast of Queensland, has been substantially modified both inland, to allow mining, agricultural and grazing activities, and along the coast to allow industrial ports, marinas, aquaculture and residential developments (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Queensland Government 2012). For example, by 2020 the port capacity along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) is expected to triple to support the predicted growth in Queenslandâs annual coal production (Grech <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2015). IUCN considered this unprecedented scale of development as a serious threat to biodiversity in the GBRWHA (Douvere and Badman 2012).<br/><br/>Activities associated with coastal development, such as land reclamation, vessel traffic and construction, may result in the physical loss and degradation of habitat for cetaceans (Jefferson et al. 2009, Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013). The reduction of suitable habitat may force local populations of Snubfin Dolphins to adjust to the remaining resources through a reduction in survival rate and population size, or emigration to more suitable (though probably suboptimal) areas (Andren 1994, Fahrig 1997, Jefferson 2000). Dredging involved in the construction, maintenance and expansion of ports is of particular concern (Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Todd <em>et al</em>. 2015). Because most ports across the Snubfin Dolphinsâ range are located in relatively shallow waters, they all require large volumes of dredging. For example, the Gladstone Western Basin project in Queensland involved the dredging of 22 million cubic meters of soil (Ports Australia 2014).<br/><br/>In addition to their impacts on dolphin habitat, these activities may disturb cetaceans through physical displacement and increased underwater noise (Jensen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rako <em>et al</em>. 2013). For example, in the Fitzroy River, Queensland, it was estimated that two proposed port developments would have overlapped with 14% (49 kmÂ²) of the representative range and 17.7% (41 kmÂ²) of the core area used by Snubfin Dolphins (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). The impacted area likely would have been substantially larger considering the indirect effects of the construction activities on the nearby habitats and the long-term consequences of daily operating activities on the entire area as result of seabed âreclamationâ, percussive pile driving, dredging, increased vessel traffic and a decline in water quality (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<br/><br/>Additionally, habitat loss and fragmentation from coastal zone developments and associated activities can influence the population genetic structure of biological populations through their isolation (Keyghobadi 2007). Given the low densities, population genetic structure and limited gene flow found among populations of Snubfin Dolphins, a further loss of genetic variation may reduce the ability of individuals to adapt to a changing environment, cause inbreeding depression (reduced survival and reproduction) and increase their probability of extinction (Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2007, Andrews 2014, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>Incidental capture</em></strong><br/>Entanglement or bycatch of dolphins in recreational and commercial fishing gear is one of the most serious threats to marine mammal populations and species around the world (Read <em>et a</em>l. 2006, Read 2008). Snubfin Dolphins are susceptible to entanglement, especially in gillnets, which are often found closer to the mouths of rivers, creeks and estuaries where Snubfin Dolphins are more likely to be found (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parra and JedensjÃ¶ 2009). Snubfin Dolphins have been killed in localized areas along the east coast of Queensland in anti-shark nets set to protect bathers (Heinsohn 1979, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) has been in operation since the early 1960s across many Queensland beaches, using nets, drum lines, or a combination of both to reduce the perceived risk of shark attack. Between 1967 and 1987, 520 dolphins were caught in Queensland shark nets. The Snubfin Dolphin was the most frequently bycaught species in nets north of Mackay (Paterson 1990) with the maximum average of about 10 Snubfin Dolphins per year (assuming that all dolphins caught were Snubfin). In 1992, following the introduction of new methods to minimise by-catch, the number of Snubfin Dolphins caught in the shark nets between 1992 and 1995 declined to a maximum of 1.3 per year (Gribble <em>et al</em>. 1998). At present, 13 shark nets and 149 drum lines are operating in Queensland. Between 1997 and 2011, a total of 11 Snubfin Dolphins were caught in the QSCP corresponding to about 1.8 per year (Meager <em>et al</em>. 2012). Most captures of Snubfin Dolphins in shark nets occurred in the Cairns, Townsville, and Mackay areas, suggesting the potential for local stock depletion (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Snubfin Dolphins are also known to die in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries (Hale 1997, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). In southern Papua New Guinea bycatch in gillnet fisheries and at least occasional direct catches (of which there are anecdotal records, Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2017) are considered the most significant threats to Snubfin Dolphins. During a 15-day field trip to the Kikori Delta in 2015, five Snubfin Dolphins were confirmed as having been bycaught in large-mesh gillnets (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of Snubfin Dolphin bycatch throughout the speciesâ range, it is clear that even small numbers are unsustainable and would result in rapid local population declines.<br/><br/><strong><em>Water pollution and climate change</em></strong><br/>Sources of anthropogenic contaminants are likely to increase in the future across northern Australia, as a result of the widespread use of several new pesticides (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012), increasing annual runoff (Chiew and McMahon 2002), and rapid urban and industrial development. The water discharge by many rivers across the Snubfin Dolphinâs range in Australia is of poor quality, often with contaminant concentrations expected to cause environmental harm (Francey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2012, Schaffelke <em>et al</em>. 2012). Accordingly, a recent study detected high levels of organochlorines (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in biopsies collected from Snubfin Dolphins on the Great Barrier Reef along the Queensland coast (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Although exposure to contaminants may not directly cause the death of an animal, it may affect its health in numerous ways, including increased susceptibility to disease and impairment of metabolic functions (De Swart <em>et al</em>. 1996, Bossart 2011).<br/><br/>In Queensland, floods normally exceed their natural ranges of variation due to inland catchment modifications that result in large amounts of fresh water discharge, sediment, heavy metals, nutrients and pesticides being discharged into the estuary and adjacent coastal areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Furnas 2003). The effects of a flood on dolphins generally are temporary until natural conditions are re-established (Fury and Harrison 2011). However, it has been suggested that peaks in dolphin mortality (Holyoake <em>et al</em>. 2009, Meager and Limpus 2014), such as those recorded in Queensland in 2011 (DEHP 2012), occur when floods are sustained for long periods. Modelling studies estimated that the annual runoff in catchments on the east coast of Australia could increase by up to 15% by the year 2030 (Chiew and McMahon 2002). Altered coastal conditions and projected increases in cyclone severity, floods, storm surges, and sea surface temperature could affect dolphin habitat and food resources (Lawler <em>et al</em>. 2007, Meager and Limpus 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>Cumulative impacts</em></strong><br/>The ongoing alteration of coastal systems has greatly undermined the resilience of many biotic communities, populations, and species living in estuaries, making them more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity and anthropogenic stressors (Hobday and Lough 2011). Such effects are likely to be exacerbated when natural systems are subjected to multiple stressors as a result of cumulative impacts and negative synergistic interactions (Venter et al. 2006, Crain et al. 2008, Halpern et al. 2008). Recent studies on other inshore dolphin populations living in highly industrialized regions have reported negative population trends. In the Pearl River estuary, China, modelling of demographic data suggested that Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>) have declined at about 2.4% per year (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2012), in the Yangtze River the population of Yangtze Finless Porpoises (<em>Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis</em>) has been declining at a rate of about 6% per year (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012), while in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, the local isolated Bottlenose Dolphin (<em>Tursiops </em>sp.) population declined by about 30% over a 12-year period (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2007). By analogy, a reduction in the number of Snubfin Dolphins is likely given the multiple impacts of port expansion, development projects, water pollution, vessel traffic and increasing frequency of natural catastrophic events.","<strong>Population Abundance<br/></strong>At present, there is no range-wide estimate of the abundance of Snubfin Dolphins. Estimates of abundance from mark-recapture studies of photo-identified individuals are only available for a few selected populations across Australia (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Available abundance estimates indicate that Snubfin Dolphins occur in small populations of typically fewer than 150 individuals. Places where abundance has been estimated in Queensland include Cleveland Bay (310 kmÂ²) with estimates ranging from 64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 51-80) to 76 (95% CI 65-88) (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a) and Keppel Bay with estimates of 71 (95% CI 61-80) to 80 (95% CI 68-93) (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Available abundance estimates in the Northern Territory are of 19 (18-20) to 70 (49-90) in the Darwin region (1,086 kmÂ²) (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2017) and 136 (95% CI 58-317) to 222 (95% CI 146-336) in Port Essington (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a). An estimated 133 (95% CI 127-148) Snubfin Dolphins inhabit waters of Roebuck Bay and 48 (95% CI 41-58) to 54 (95% CI 51-60) the waters of Cygnet Bay, Western Australia (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>There is no quantitative information on trends in abundance across the speciesâ range. Studies in Cleveland Bay indicated that even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates, population trends would be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size were greater than 20% per year (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a). A multiyear study (ongoing since 2006) in Keppel Bay, Central Queensland, showed that between 2006-2010 abundance estimates of Snubfin Dolphins remained stable at around 70-80 individuals (Cagnazzi 2013), before starting to decline slightly in 2011 to about 68 (64-72) individuals in 2013 (Cagnazzi unpub. data). The decline in abundance estimates was associated with a period of extensive summer flooding that has been affecting this region every summer since 2010. Even though the negative trend is small and the 95% CIs of the estimates overlap, the decline has been consistent since 2011. Indices of abundance, including proportion of marked individuals observed in recent surveys (2014-2016) in the same area, showed a substantial variation across years with the lower estimates being 100 (68-147) in 2014, 163 (132-200) in 2015 and 103 (74-144) in 2016 (Cagnazzi unpub. data).<br/><br/><strong>Population Structure</strong><br/>Genetic analyses conducted on biopsies collected across two nearby populations in the Kimberly, Western Australia (i.e., Roebuck Bay and Cygnet Bay ~ 250 km apart) showed significant levels of population structure at both mitochondrial and nuclear markers (Brown et al. 2014). Contemporary migration rates per generation (20 years) between these two sampling locations were low (&lt; 10%, m &lt; 0.1). Similar results were obtained for three sampling locations in Central Queensland (Cleveland Bay, Keppel Bay, Whitsundays) that are 250-400 km apart (Parra et al. unpublished data). No genetic information on population structure is available from the Northern Territory of Australia or from Papua New Guinea. Overall, the available genetic data suggest that Snubfin Dolphins exist as a metapopulation of small, largely isolated population fragments with limited gene flow.<br/><br/><strong>Summary</strong><br/>The limited data presented above indicate that the Snubfin Dolphin has a restricted and discontinuous geographical distribution, occurs mainly over a narrow strip of shallow coastal waters, occurs in relatively small subpopulations, and the subpopulations are relatively isolated with limited gene flow among them. No subpopulation studied to date is larger than 250 mature individuals (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation has &lt;1,000 mature individuals and that there could well be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals across the range.<br/><br/>Similar to other small cetaceans, Snubfin Dolphins are long-lived (at least 28-30 years), have slow rates of increase (0.037, range 0.02-0.06), late maturity (reproductive maturity at 8-10 years of age) and low reproductive rates (one calf every 2-5 years) (Moore 2015), making them particularly vulnerable to even low rates of human-caused mortality. For example, based on model estimates of intrinsic growth rate (0.037) and generation time (20) for Snubfin Dolphins, Moore (2015) estimated that human-caused mortality rates of 4.4%, 5.0% and 6.5% would lead to declines of 30%, 50% and 80% in population size after three generations. These threshold mortality rates correspond to Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) and Critically Endangered (CR) under the A criterion (population size reduction).<br/><br/>Although there is little quantitative data on Snubfin Dolphin population trends, a declining population can be inferred throughout many parts of the range given the speciesâ high vulnerability to human-caused mortality (e.g., from bycatch in gillnets and shark nets), its restricted distribution and reliance on coastal and riverine waters, the low estimates of abundance in surveyed areas, and the increasing habitat degradation and destruction throughout its range.",Decreasing,"Australian Snubfin Dolphins (hereafter referred to as Snubfin Dolphins) inhabit coastal, shallow waters of the tropical and subtropical zones of Australia and southern Papua New Guinea (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2017, Parra and Cagnazzi 2017). The distribution map accompanying this assessment depicts the inferred distribution as a continuous band throughout coastal waters within the 20 m isobath in countries where these dolphins are known or believed to occur. Although distribution is considered continuous across the range, the occurrence of Snubfin Dolphins along the northern Australia coast and southern Papua New Guinea is poorly documented (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). Gaps in occurrence of several hundred kilometres are apparent along the east coast of Queensland (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<br/><br/>In Australia, Snubfin Dolphins have been reported from Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012), across the northern coastline (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2011) and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and south along the east coast to as far south as the Brisbane River (Paterson <em>et al</em>. 1998, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). Sightings south of Roebuck Bay in Western Australia and south of Keppel Bay in Queensland are rare and considered extralimital.<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea, Snubfin Dolphins are known to inhabit the Kikori Delta from Morigio Island east to Baimurru. It is likely that they also occur further east to Karema, which is situated at the headwaters of the Purari River. No Snubfin Dolphins have been sighted around the Daru region or west of Morigio Island, although only limited opportunistic surveys were undertaken (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2017).<br/><br/>There are currently no confirmed records of Snubfin Dolphins from other regions of the Pacific Islands. Anecdotal sightings of Snubfin Dolphins have been reported from the Solomon Islands (Bass 2010). However, these records were provided during interviews to investigate the status of Dugongs (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) in the Solomon Islands, therefore the identification (at both species and genus levels) is highly uncertain.","There is no evidence of traditional use or trade for consumption or medicinal use across the Snubfin Dolphinâs range in Australia.

The National Dolphin Conservation Plan has promoted the conservation of dolphins in Australian waters by supporting research into inshore dolphin conservation, including investigating key threats and determining the conservation status of priority species such as the Snubfin Dolphin and the Australian Humpback Dolphin (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>). To identify the primary research objectives to inform the conservation and management of Australiaâs tropical inshore dolphins, an expert workshop was held on April 9-10, 2015 in Canberra. The resulting Inshore Dolphin National Research Strategy (DOE 2015) identified the following research objectives applicable to Snubfin and Humpback Dolphins: 1) provide for access to and analysis of standardised national tropical dolphin data to assess distribution and underpin management and conservation, 2) conduct long-term monitoring project to determine trends, mitigate impacts from threats, and support adaptive management and conservation of tropical inshore dolphins, 3) identify, map and assess threats to tropical inshore dolphins, understand related impacts, and mitigate risks, 4) improve knowledge of genetic connectivity dispersal and movement at national, regional and local scales, 5) foster collaborative and national approaches to effectively gather mortality, life history and dietary information from stranded and by-caught specimens, 6) foster community participation in data collection on tropical inshore dolphins and develop a continuous improvement approach to methods and related programs. Guidelines on sampling and statistical methods to achieve some of these objectives have been recently described in Brooks <em>et al. </em>(2014).

Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts are known to become entangled and drown due to incidental bycatch (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009), including this species off Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 2002) and Micronesian waters (Dalebout <em>et al. </em>2008). </p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of mesoplodont beaked whales (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009), including this species (Wang and Yang 2006). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005). </p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms, including this species (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2012), is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm, Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of mesoplodonts (Kajiwara <em>et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al.</em> 2016), and is a potential health hazard of unknown significance.</p>  <p>Mesoplodonts are small whales that normally live far offshore; mortalities from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some possible cases have been reported (Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160; </p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species, although the nature and magnitude of these impacts is unknown at this time (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>Although, individually, none of the above factors may represent an existential threat to this species, their cumulative effects could be unsustainable for this uncommon-to-rare species.</p>","<p>There are no estimates of abundance, but the species does not appear to be common anywhere and is likely rare.

Its inferred distribution, primarily in tropical and warm-temperate waters of the western Pacific, is based entirely on stranded specimens (MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006), of which the vast majority (at least 28) have been recorded from Japan and Taiwan (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is also known from the Philippines (Field Museum 2011). In the Southern Hemisphere, three strandings have been reported in eastern Australia and two in New Zealand, but in all of these cases the identification needs to be confirmed. In the eastern Pacific, single strandings have occurred in southern California and the GalÃ¡pagos; an oft-cited specimen from Baja California, Mexico (<em>e.g</em>., Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1988, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006, Culik 2011) housed in the San Diego Natural History Museum has been identified genetically as <em>M. peruvianus</em>. The recent recognition of the very similar and largely sympatric <em>M. hotaula</em> as a separate species calls into question whether <em>M. ginkgodens</em> occurs in the Indian Ocean at all (Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2012). <em>M. hotuala</em> was originally described from a stranding in Sri Lanka (Deraniyagala 1963a, b), but a short time later it was synonymized (incorrectly) with <em>M. ginkgodens</em> (Moore and Gilmore 1965). Since then, Sri Lanka has continued to be listed as a range state for <em>M. ginkgodens</em> (<em>e.g</em>., Mead 1989, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Specimens reported as <em>M. ginkgodens</em> from China were reidentified as <em>M. densirostris</em> (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2011). Currently, evidence that <em>M. ginkgodens</em> occurs in the Indian Ocean rests on a single tooth of questionable provenance from the Maldives (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1999). </p><p>No map is provided for this species           because the distribution is uncertain with a few strandings as           the only available data.</p>",<p>This species has occasionally been taken by Japanese and Taiwanese whalers.</p>,Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

It is targeted by commercial fisheries throughout its range, but species-specific fisheries data are not typically collected. Of the ten species of sciaenids taken by the demersal fishing sector, this species is the fifth most common one in the West African markets. Following the near doubling of the industrial trawl fleets in most West African nations in the late 1990s, steep catch declines occurred&#160;to the level where pair trawling became unprofitable around 2005. A scientific trawl survey conducted along the West African coast reported a 37% decline in sciaenid biomass from 2000 to 2006. In Ghana, the body size of sciaenids in the catch declined by 50% from 1990 to the 2000s. Fishing effort has either increased or remained the same over time, so declines are inferred to have continued. Based on these catch and fisheries survey data, this species is suspected to have declined by at least 30% over the past three generation lengths, or since the 1990s. It is listed as Vulnerable A2bd. Improvements in fisheries and population monitoring are needed. Research is needed on life history and biology.","This demersal species inhabits sandy, muddy and rocky substrates from the shoreline and hypersaline lagoons to at least 150 metres depth on the continental shelf. Spawning occurs near estuaries (F. Nunoo pers. comm.). It feeds on worms, fish and small crustaceans. The maximum total length is 230 cm, but is common to 85 cm. Life history data are not available. <em>Pseudotolithus senegalensis</em>, which has a similar body size, ecology and distribution to this species, is applied as a proxy to estimate generation length. The longevity of <em>P. senegalensis</em> is 21 years and age at first maturity is 3-4 years, and one generation length is estimated as 12 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction â age at first reproduction)/2.","Overfishing is the primary major threat to this species.&#160;<br/><br/>Bottom trawling activity in West Africa has degraded the habitat that demersal species are dependent on. Pollution from agricultural chemicals, sewage and litter may also exacerbate degradation of marine habitats. Oil slicks from oil extraction in the region (Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and soon Ghana) is also a threat to fishes. An expected increase in sea surface temperatures due to global climate change has the potential to cause a reduction in the intensity of upwelling in the region, which is the main driver for marine productivity.","This species is relatively uncommon throughout its range.&#160;It occurs in low numbers in Ghana, Nigeria, Benin and Togo.&#160;In Angola, this species composed up to 7% of total sciaenid landings in 2004. It composed less than 5% of the weight of total sciaenid stock surveyed by the R/V Fridtjof Nansen. The most commonly marketed sciaenids in this region in decreasing order are&#160;<em>Pseudotolithus senegalensis, P. mbizi, P. typus, P. elongatus</em>&#160;and<em>&#160;P. senegallus</em>.&#160;<br/><br/>Many demersal fish species are overexploited in West Africa mainly due to high fishing effort, especially by the pair-trawling fleet, and export market demand.&#160;In response to the growing market demand, various industrial gears, including purse seine and trawls, were employed in West African waters by the early 1970s. With the implementation of exclusive economic zones (EEZ) in the late 1970s, the range of many fleets was reduced. In the late 1990s, the numbers of trawlers almost doubled in most West African nations in response to the profitability of the industry, but catch rates declined to the level where pair trawling commenced around 2005. Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana and Cameroon have the largest fishing fleets in West Africa.&#160;This species primarily inhabits coastal waters to depths of 60 m, which is well within the depth and habitat that trawling occurs (25 to 75 m).&#160;<br/><br/>The Fridtjof&#160;Nansen stock assessment survey&#160;for all sciaenids (10 species)&#160;in the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem indicated sciaenid biomass declined by 37% over a six-year time period from 1,046 tonnes in 2000&#160;to 664 t in 2006. Mean body sizes of sciaenids in trawl surveys conducted in Ghana declined by 50% over time, from over 50 cm in 1989-1990 to&#160;around 25-30 cm in the 2000s (F. Nunoo pers. comm.). Small individuals are frequently discarded as bycatch, which also contributes to overfishing. Fishing effort has increased or remained the same over time, and therefore, biomass is inferred to have continued to decline. Based on these data, this species has undergone a suspected global-level decline of at least 30% over the past three generation lengths, an estimated period of 36 years.",Decreasing,This species is distributed in the eastern Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola (Maigret and Ly 1986).

It breeds during the boreal winter, as the specimens found so far on land and calling from burrows and nesting have been in the period December to May (Kawakami <em>et al</em>. 2012, FjeldsÃ¥ 2013, Pyle <em>et al.</em> 2014). The nesting individuals recorded on Higashijima in February 2015 were found in a mosaic of scrub forest and grassland, consisting of Screw Pine <em>Pandanus boninensis</em> and Bonin Silver Grass <em>Miscanthus boninensis</em> (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). The nest site was a burrow in grassland. The individual recorded on Midway Atoll in 1991 was found in a crevice in rocky habitat (Pyle <em>et al.</em> 2014). To date, it has only been found on small islands. It may co-utilize nesting sites with Bulwer's Petrel <em>Bulweria bulwerii</em> (Pyle <em>et al.</em> 2014).","Introduced Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> pose a considerable threat to the species, being present on more than 20 islands in the Bonin group (Kawakami <em>et al.</em> 2012). On Higashijima Island, three carcasses of Bryanâs Shearwater were found that had been depredated by rats and it is suspected that the paucity of records of the species may be a result of rat predation (Kawakami <em>et al.</em> 2012, FjeldsÃ¥ 2013). Predation of smaller seabirds by rats on Higashijima dramatically increased in 2005, attributed to a shift in the foraging behaviour of the rats (Kawakami <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Ministry of Environment responded to the mass depredation of small petrels by initiating a rat eradication program on Higashijima in 2008, which has apparently been successful, with no rats observed since 2010 (Kawakami <em>et al</em>. 2012). Rats are also absent from Kitanoshima Island, but remain in large parts of the speciesâ range. Eradication of rats from these islands would be necessary for these areas to be suitable as breeding locations (Kawakami <em>et al.</em> 2012, FjeldsÃ¥ 2013). Invasive plant species, <em>Casuarina</em> <em>equisetifolia</em> and <em>Leucaena</em> <em>leucocephala</em>, may also have impacted breeding success on Higashijima, as they invade the breeding habitat and alter the environment (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). The Forest Agency has eradicated almost all matured <em>C. equisetifolia</em> so far and is conducting an eradication program for <em>L. leucocephala</em>. Light pollution is another potential threat. It is a significant cause of mortality in Newellâs Shearwater <em>Puffinus newelli</em>, and two of the six <em>P.</em> bryani specimens that were located in the Bonin Island prior to 2015 were collected after apparent disorientation due to artificial lighting.","The species's population size has not been quantified, but given its apparent rarity it is thought to have an extremely small population, probably numbering fewer than 250 mature individuals. The population is therefore placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals, assumed to equate to a total population of c.70-380 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species is currently only known from individuals found in burrows on Midway Island in the north-western Hawaiian chain, <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, and in the Bonin Islands (Ogasawara Islands), <strong>Japan</strong>. The species was described from an individual collected in 1963 on Midway Island, with another individual of this species observed on Midway during the winters of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. It is considered unlikely that the species is regularly breeding on Midway or other Hawaiian atolls, as the seabird colonies there have been studied in detail and appropriate natural breeding habitat is lacking (Pyle <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Subsequent analysis of specimens from the Bonin Islands suggests that its main breeding range is within that group, although much exploration is still to be done (Kawakami <em>et al.</em> 2012). In February 2015, 10 birds and at least one nest were discovered on Higashijima in the Bonin Islands (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015), after calls were detected there and on other Bonin Islands with passive acoustic sensors in 2012-2014. Prior to 2012, five of the six individuals recorded on the Bonin Islands had been corpses, three of which had been predated by Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> (Kawakami <em>et al.</em> 2012, FjeldsÃ¥ 2013). The at-sea distribution is effectively unknown, although at minimum it transits through the tropical or subtropical waters of the central western Pacific Ocean between the north-western Hawaiian chain and the Bonin Islands.

Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","On Maui, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, nesting takes place mainly between 2,000 and 3,000 m, in lava cavities with little vegetation nearby (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Elsewhere, for example West Maui (J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007) and Kaua'i (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007), it nests at lower elevations, amongst dense shrubs and ferns or in native grasslands with bracken (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998, P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2007). On HaleakalÄ, Maui, birds nest in rock crevices and tunnels that are over 0.5 m deep, often exceeding two metres (Simons and Hodges 1998, J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Pairs nest in cavities in the volcanic terrain, in burrows beneath rocks or at the base of clay cliffs (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007). At lower altitudes, they excavate burrows or nest in cavities often at the base of trees (Simons and Hodges 1998, P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007), although many burrows on Lana'i are not at the base of trees (J. Penniman<em> in litt.</em> 2007). On Lana'i, birds breed in dense uluhe fern habitat (<em>Dicranopteris linearis</em> and <em>Diplopterygium pinnatum</em>) and start breeding in March, whereas in HaleakalÄ, Maui, birds begin breeding in mid-February (Penniman <em>et al</em>. 2008). On Kaua'i, birds breed in montane wet forests, where burrows are located along ridgelines in predominantly native forest, often at the base of large trees. On average, birds take five to six years to reach maturity but begin visiting colonies to establish pair bonds and prospect nesting sites at 2-3 years (Hess and Banko 2006). Most eggs are laid in May and June, with most young fledging by December (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005). Birds nesting at higher elevations appear to finish provisioning chicks earlier, with most birds having departed the colony at HaleakalÄ by the end of October. The diet comprises mostly fish and squid, with squid constituting c.50-75% of the food ingested (Simons and Hodges 1998). It has been found that at least some birds nesting on Lana'i feed in waters around the Aleutian Islands, as shown through the use of tracking devices on several breeding individuals (P. Baicich&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2007).<em> P. sandwichensis</em> regularly is observed foraging in mixed species flocks in association with predatory fish species (Mitchell <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;<p></p>","<p>Historically the species suffered declines through harvesting by early Polynesians and during the period of Hawaiian settlement beginning c.1,800 years ago (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species may have been restricted to its current breeding range since the arrival of Europeans (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most serious current threat is predation by introduced vertebrates including Indian mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus,&#160;</em>feral cats, Common Barn-owls <em>Tyto</em> <em>alba</em>, rats, dogs, and pigs. Although not yet established on Kaua'i and Lana'i islands, mongooses represent an ongoing major threat to nestling and adult birds at breeding colonies on the other islands within the Hawaiian Petrelâs range. Feral cat and rat depredation, where unmanaged on other islands, continues to limit recovery capacity. Considerable efforts are ongoing to reduce the impact of cat predation on the species with cat-proof fences erected on Maui and Mauna Loa. Adults and nestlings are very susceptible to predation, as nests are on the ground, and they are naÃ¯ve to predators.</p>  <p>A significantly lower percentage of birds come ashore to nest during El NiÃ±o years (c.40% compared to c.65% normally) (C.N. Hodges <em>per</em> Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003), suggesting that the species is sensitive to such disturbances in environmental conditions (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>  <p>Each autumn during the fledging season, some of the fledgling birds become grounded as a result of light attraction and disorientation. Occassionally, birds collide with sources of light, and mortality sometimes occurs as a result of collisions with fences and power-lines mostly on Kaua'i and Maui (Simons 1985, Cooper and Day 1998, Simons and Hodges 1998). Once on the ground, fledglings are unable to fly and are killed by cars, cats and dogs, die from environmental exposure or injuries, or are recovered by the public. The siting of the Kaheawa wind farm on Lana'i also appears to be causing ongoing mortality at a potentially significant rate.</p>  Some areas of nesting habitat have been lost to the pressures of modern urbanisation and degraded by feral goats and pigs and weeds. Nest burrows are trampled by feral goats, mouflon sheep and Chital Deer&#160;<em>Axis axis&#160;</em>(Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, H. T. Harvey and Associates 2015) however, these are now excluded from the largest colony and deer&#160;are not present at the majority of sites. On Lana'i, habitat degradation caused by the invasive tree, Strawberry Guava <em>Psidium</em> <em>cattleianum</em>, is considered to be the biggest threat to the long term survival of the colony (J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In the past, considerable amounts of the Hawaiian Petrelâs habitat were converted for livestock, however as the majority of colonies are now protected, this represents a much reduced threat.<p></p>","Spear <em>et al.</em> (1995) give a best estimate of 3,750-4,500 breeding pairs based on at-sea surveys. This roughly equates to 7,500-9,000 mature individuals, and 11,250-13,500 individuals in total. The discovery of possibly several thousand birds breeding on Lana'i during terrestrial surveys in 2006-2007 and two small colonies on West Maui (J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007), probably in the tens or low hundreds of birds (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007), may bring the estimated breeding population close to the upper estimate of 6,500-8,300 pairs calculated by Spear <em>et al.</em> (1995). However,&#160;the rapid decline in at least the population on Kaua'i would suggest that the population size may now in fact be smaller than this.

Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, and as burrows are found they are included in basic breeding biology study; feral cats are being trapped and removed; studies on Common Barn-owl&#160;<em>Tyto alba</em> are being designed; a rat population assessment was due to begin in 2007, with control by rodenticide to be carried out subsequently; habitat restoration work may begin in January 2008; and public education projects will be implemented in 2008 (J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In 2006, a fence was completed to encircle a large portion of the breeding habitat on Lana'i; the purpose was to exclude ungulates that damage the vegetation thus impacting the island's water supply (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Simultaneously, a limited cat-trapping programme has been initiated in the fenced area (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. On Maui, Lana'i, and Kaua'i, grounded fledglings are collected and released, although the benefit of doing this has yet to be confirmed as very few banded individuals have subsequently been encountered (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Fencing erected for forest conservation has been modified to reduce collisions (Simons and Hodges 1998)<strong></strong>. On Kaua'i, auditory surveys to detect colonies are ongoing, and have included documenting the first known nesting sites on Kaua'i in the Upper Limahuli Preserve (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Also on Kaua'i, street lighting is shielded in critical areas and lighting on some buildings has been modified to reduce collisions (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998)<strong></strong>. A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006, under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, has enforced a campaign running since 2005, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua'i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. The island's electricity company is helping by darkening all of its 3,000 street lights, and shielding or turning some of them off. The company has also fitted large balls to power lines in an effort to reduce the number of birds that collide with the cables (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. Significant improvements have beem made in reducing light attraction and collision, although there is still a considerable amount of new and existing infrastructure that requires modification (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.  <p></p>","This marine species is highly pelagic, occurring in warm waters and rarely approaching land except near colonies. It feeds mostly on planktonic crustaceans, fish and squid but will also feed on human refuse. It mainly feeds in the day on the wing by pattering, dipping and also by surface-seizing. Its breeding season varies locally in colonies on undisturbed islets, in flat areas near the sea or inland on cliffs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)","<p>The Band-rumped Storm-petrel is threatened by a number of invasive species, and throughout its range, the species is largely restricted to breeding locations that do not possess invasive mammals. Carcasses of near-fledging chicks have been recovered from burrow entrances on Kaua'i with cat scats also recorded and cats are considered the introduced species responsible for the majority of predation events to date (Slotterback 2002, Raine et al. 2017). Cat predation is also likely to have restricted Band-rumped Storm-petrels to remote and largely inaccessible breeding locations in Macaronesian islands (Monteiro <em>et al.</em> 1999). It is suspected that House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em>&#160;may have contributed to considerable declines and potentially extirpations (Slotterback 2002, Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017). Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans</em>&#160;are considered to be restricting the distribution of the species to steep slopes with little vegetation on Lehua Islet (Raine <em>et al. </em>2017), and this species may be that observed entering burrows on Kaua'i (Galase <em>et al.</em> 2016). Small Indian Mongoose&#160;<em>Herpestes auropunctatus&#160;</em>are significant predators of the slightly larger Hawaiian Petrel&#160;<em>Pterodroma sandwichensis</em>, but have only recently become established on Kaua'i (Duffy and Capece 2014). The severity of impacts from this predator may increase, should the population be allowed to increase and spread. On Kaua'i, the introduced Common Barn Owl <em>Tyto alba</em> is a major predator of adults (Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017). Pigs are considered a significant threat to the species due to their observed impacts on other seabird species (Slotterback 2002); however, there does not appear to be any direct evidence of predation or habitat destruction caused by pigs impacting this species (Slotterback 2002, Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Band-rumped Storm-petrels have been found grounded due to light pollution in the Canary Islands (RodrÃ­guez and RodrÃ­guez 2009, Carboneras <em>et al.</em> 2018) and Hawaii (Slotterback 2002, Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017). Mortality due to striking structures while disorientated has occurred (Slotterback 2002). However, the species appears less prone to 'fallout' than expected, and impacts are therefore likely to be of a lower severity (RodrÃ­guez and RodrÃ­guez 2009, Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017). The threat from introduced predators appears far more severe than that from light pollution at present.</p>  The Band-rumped Storm-petrel is thought to have been hunted on a large scale in the early 16th and 17th century, with accounts from the Azores of a small black and white seabird that was killed nightly by the thousands for food and oil (Bolton<em> et al. </em>2008). However, this threat is highly unlikely to return on anything close to this scale.","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number around 150,000 individuals.

Cats, rats and potentially mice, are thought to have caused rapid declines in the population upon their introduction to Cape Verde (M. Lecoq <em>in litt.</em>) and continue to restrict large colonies to only those areas inaccessible to the invasives (M. Lecoq <em>in litt</em>.). 123 wings of Cape Verde Storm-petrel were found in a potential breeding location on Santa Luzia, presumed to have been predated by cats (Oliviera <em>et al</em>. 2013). Goats are likely to pose a threat through trampling burrows, having been introduced to the islands by early settlers and reaching very high densities, with tens of thousands on single islands in the late 1700s (Hazevoet and Masseti 2011). Humans collect seabirds and shellfish from the island; however, it is thought that smaller species such as this are not directly targeted, but are vulnerable to humans trampling nesting burrows (Hazevoet 1994). It is likely that breeding habitat has been and will continue to be lost to the tourist industry, which has grown considerably (Ribiero <em>et al.</em> 2013). This may also increase the amount of light pollution in the area, known to cause grounding in Band-rumped Storm-petrel <em>H. castro</em> (RodrÃ­guez and RodrÃ­guez 2009), a closely-related species.

Effective conservation measures are urgently needed. <p></p>,"All presumed breeding sites are on cliffs, presumably in healthy vegetation. Recent information indicates that breeding occurs during the austral summer, with laying around December and fledging between February and March (Riethmuller <em>et al.</em> 2012). Birds are thought to return to nest sites nocturnally to reduce chances of predation (Tatayah <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species feeds at the water surface (Shirihai <em>et al.</em> 2014).<p></p>","Like the threatened Barau's Petrel <em>Pterodroma baraui</em> (also endemic to La RÃ©union), the main threats to the Mascarene Petrel are likely to be predation by feral cats <em>Felis catus </em>and House Rats <em>Rattus rattus </em>(Riethmuller <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as urban light-induced mortality, which mainly affects inexperienced juveniles (Le Corre <em>et al</em>. 2002). Cats may be the greatest threat to the species on La RÃ©union, as they predate adults as well as chicks, and likely restricts the species's distribution (Riethmuller <em>et al</em>. 2012). Rats represent a significant predation pressure on nests, and the species's reproductive output is thought to be minimal in areas accessible to rats (Riethmuller <em>et al</em>. 2012). 30 birds have been found stranded, apparently after being attracted by light between 1996 and 2011; 28 were released successfully and two died (Le Corre 1999, Le Corre <em>et al</em>. 1999, M. Le Corre <em>in litt</em>. 1999, Le Corre <em>et al</em>. 2003, Riethmuller <em>et al</em>. 2012). Widespread light pollution, such as street lamps and sport installations, are responsible for the greatest majority of light-induced petrel mortality on La RÃ©union (Le Corre <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2003); the roadkill specimen on Mauritius is further evidence of the problem (Tatayah <em>et al</em>. 2011). Light-induced mortality of the juveniles of this rare petrel is likely to affect the long-term population dynamics, but their longevity will cause a lag before real population declines are identified (Le Corre <em>et al</em>. 2002). The feeding behaviour of the species, which is often seen scavenging floating offal behind boats, makes it vulnerable to detrimental effects of interactions with fisheries, although bycatch of this species has not yet been documented (Shirihai <em>et al</em>. 2014). Past exploitation of Mascarene Petrels for food likely contributed to driving local extinctions and range contraction (Riethmuller <em>et al</em>. 2012).<p></p>","<p>From their at-sea counts, Attie<em> et al.</em> (1997) suggest that the population may be around 1,000 individuals, implying 250 (45-400) breeding pairs, although 50-100 pairs was considered more likely (V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt. </em>1999), i.e. 100-200 mature individuals.&#160; However, recent estimates indicate that the breeding population may be just a few dozen pairs (Tatayah&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). The recent sighting of 33 different individuals in three days at sea south of La RÃ©union suggests that a more likely breeding population size is 100 pairs (Shirihai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pseudobulweria aterrima</em>&#160;is endemic to <strong>La</strong> <strong>RÃ©union </strong>(<strong>to France</strong>). A subfossil mandible was found in Rodrigues (Mauritius) and a dead bird has been found in Black River Gorges National Park, Mauritius (Tatayah&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011),&#160;but there is no confirmation of breeding on Mauritius.&#160;</p><p>Confirmation of continued breeding on La RÃ©union came with the discovery of an active nest in 2016 above Saint-Joseph (LIFE+ Petrels 2016), and a second location has now been confirmed with 38 birds banded from the two colonies (LIFE+ Petrels 2017). Acoustic surveys had previously detected the species in several places in the central part of La RÃ©union Island between 500 and 1500 meters above sea level (mostly at Grand Bassin, commune of Le Tampon and Entre Deux) (Reithmuller <em>et al. </em>2012, Shirahai <em>et al. </em>2014). Prior to these discoveries, which came after many thousands of hours of audio recording and the use of thermal imaging equipment, five breeding areas were described in 2001. These breeding areas are thought to only hold a handful of pairs (V. Bretagnolle&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2005), and the only confirmation of breeding (and indeed that the species persisted at all) came from fledglings recovered after becoming grounded through attraction to lights (Le Corre&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, 2003). More than 45 individuals have been recovered through an island scale rescue campaign (Riethmuller&#160;<em>et al .</em>2012, SEOR and LIFE+ Project&#160;<em>unpubl. data</em>).&#160;</p><p>The mountainous parts of Black River Gorges National Park on Mauritius hold similar habitat to the suspected nesting areas on La RÃ©union (Tatayah&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong></p><p>Since 1996, there has been a campaign to quantify urban light-induced mortality and to rescue as many birds as possible (Le Corre 1999, Le Corre <em>et al. </em>1999, Le Corre <em>et al</em>. 2002). The rescues have been successful, with over 90% of the petrels (of various species) found on La RÃ©union being released again (Le Corre <em>et al. </em>2002). From 1996-2002, a public appeal aimed at rescuing downed birds produced eight petrels, of which seven were banded and released (Le Corre <em>et al.</em> 2003). One ringed individual released after being rescued has been resighted alive several years later (Riethmuller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The SociÃ©tÃ© d'Ãtudes Ornithologiques de La RÃ©union is working in partnership with EDF RÃ©union to reduce light pollution on La RÃ©union (Bizien 2013). Surveys have identified the location and characteristics of the breeding area; however, no concerted attempts have been made to assess the impact of introduced predators and predator control has not been trialled (V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt. </em>2005, &#160;Riethmuller <em>et al.</em> 2012). A series of expeditions to remove rats from around one of the last breeding colonies of this species on La RÃ©union was launched in August and September 2014 (Jan and Fouillot 2014). Cat control measures have also been introduced around colonies.&#160; A LIFE-funded project from 2014 to 2020 aims to limit the decline of &#160;Mascarene and Barau's Petrels through techniques including: the development of appropriate conservation actions, predator control in remote areas, awareness-raising, and improving ecological knowledge of these species (LIFE+ PETRELS 2014).

Eggs are laid in burrows or cavities located underneath large rocks, within cliffs or rocky boulders, or among large tree root systems. Birds generally nest in loose and small colonies. In New Caledonia, most of the recently discovered colonies are small (&lt;10 pairs) and spread over large areas of several thousand square metres (Spaggiari and BarÃ© 2004, Baudat-Franceschi 2006, Delelis <em>et al.</em> 2007, Le Breton 2008, DromzÃ©e <em>unpubl. data</em>). Breeding appears to occur throughout the year, although at least on Tahiti, there appears to be a peak between March and July (Villard <em>et al. </em>2006).&#160;<p></p>","<p>Predation and disturbance from non-native species represent the most serious threat to the species. Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> have been identified as the greatest threat to the Tahiti Petrel, with predation impacting both chicks and adults. Being a relatively long-lived species, adult mortality has a strong impact on demography. Petrel remains have been identified in 1-8% of all cat scats (n=4166) in large parts of the species's range (Palmas <em>et al</em>. 2017). Rats <em>Rattus</em> spp., dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> and pigs <em>Sus domesticus</em> are likely contributing to declines in reproductive success (G. Dutson <em>in litt</em>. 2003), with both dogs and pigs observed to dig out adults and chicks from their burrows (Villard <em>et al</em>. 2006) On Grand Terre, the Marquesas and Society Islands, rat predation is an observed, but unquantified problem (G. Dutson <em>in litt</em>. 2003, Bell and Pandolfi Benoit <em>unpubl. data</em>). Despite having coexisted with rats for a long period, there remains potential for rat predation to become increasingly severe in the case of continuing decline (G. Dutson <em>in litt</em>. 2003). Deer are present in parts of the petrel's range, and pose a potential threat by trampling of burrows, damaging breeding grounds and potentially leading to a higher mortality rate of fledglings. In colonies where the soil is deep enough for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters <em>Ardenna pacifica </em>to nest, there can be intense competition for burrows (Villard <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>The newly discovered sites in New Caledonia are all in areas threatened by nickel mining (Spaggiari and BarÃ© 2004, Delelis <em>et al</em>. 2007, Le Breton 2008, DromzÃ©e<em> unpubl. data</em>), with mining activities predicted to have severe negative impacts on breeding success and potential adult mortality through ingestion of harmful materials. Some translocations of chicks are planned as part of a mitigation strategy though the efficacy of this is likely to be low (Le Breton 2008). Adults and fledglings in particular, suffer from attraction to artificial lights and subsequently becoming grounded and sometimes run over by vehicles. Light pollution threatens birds mainly in the urban areas around Papeete, Tahiti (P. Raust <em>in litt</em>. 1999), and around NoumÃ©a, rural villages and active mining sites in New Caledonia. Collision with electric powerlines in the mountains of French Polynesia is thought to be responsible for a small proportion of adult mortality (P. Raust <em>in litt</em>. 2003). The species is occasionally hunted by local people for their white feathers, which are used in fishing lures (Holyoak and Thibault 1984).&#160;</p><p></p>","The overall population of the species probably does not exceed 10,000 pairs (i.e. 20,000 mature individuals) and 30,000 individuals. It is thus placed in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals, and thought to number 20,000-30,000 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"<em>Pseudobulweria rostrata</em> breeds in the Marquesas, Society and Gambier (recorded in 1995, [Thibault 1996, Thibault and Bretagnolle 1999]) Islands, <strong>French Polynesia, Fiji, American Samoa and New Caledonia</strong> (<strong>to France</strong>) It used to breed in Vanuatu (V. Bretagnolle and M. Pandolfi Benoit <em>in litt.</em> 1999) and may breed on Rarotonga, Cook Islands (Pratt <em>et al. </em>1987), as well as on other islands. Two subspecies are distinguished: <em>trouessarti</em> in New Caledonia and <em>rostrata</em> in French Polynesia, the subspecific status of birds from other archipelagos remaining unclear, although Brooke (2004) assigned them to <em>rostrata</em>. This distinction is poorly supported by morphological (Villard <em>et al. </em>2006) and genetic (Gangloff <em>et al.</em> 2012) data, and detailed analyses of vocalization differences between the two subspecies are missing.<br/><br/>In the Marquesas, <em>Pseudobulweria rostrata </em>breeds on Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa and Tahuata, totalling less than 500 pairs (Holyoak and Thibault 1984), and birds have been heard at night (possibly breeding) at Ua Pou, Ua Huka (Thibault <em>unpubl. data</em>) and Fatu Hiva (Meyer <em>unpubl. data</em>).<br/><br/>In the Society Islands, it breeds on Tahiti, Moorea and perhaps Bora Bora (P. Raust <em>in litt. </em>1999) and Raiatea (Salducci 2007), where the populations were estimated at less than 1,000 pairs and several thousand pairs respectively (Holyoak and Thibault 1984), although recent visits suggest a substantial decline (Bretagnolle and Thibault <em>unpubl. data</em>). In the Gambiers, there are 12-26 pairs on Mangareva, Akamaru and Manui (Thibault and Bretagnolle 1999).&#160;<br/><br/>In Fiji, the species breeds on Gau and Taveuni (Clunie <em>et al. </em>1978, Plant <em>et al.</em> 1989, G.

Hundreds of pairs may nest on Taveuni, where &gt;150 were seen offshore  in October 2003 and where the low open forest on steep unstable  hill-sides is similar to nesting areas on New Caledonia (G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2005).&#160;<br/><br/>In American Samoa, it breeds on Ta'u and Tutuila (Engbring and Ramsay 1989). Based on vocal activity and extensiveness of the potential habitat, several thousand (maybe 2,000) pairs may breed over the Taâu summit area (OâConnor and Rauzon 2004, Rauzon and Rudd 2014). Dozens of pairs may breed on Tutuila (OâConnor and Rauzon 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>In New Caledonia, it breeds on Grand Terre in unknown numbers, particularly in the high mountains. Based on vocal activity, the identification of 16 certain (presence signs as eggshell, down or birds) plus 22 probable colonies and an average colony size set at 5-10 pairs, the breeding population in Massif du Koniambo (mostly included in an active mining site) was estimated at at least 200-400 pairs (Delelis <em>et al. </em>2007). However, the authors acknowledge that there was no proof that observed birds bred or had bred, so this estimate should be treated with caution. Indeed, although vocalizations can be heard on several active mining sites, intensive nest search resulted in the localisation of only very few (&lt;10) breeding burrows (e.g. Spaggiari and BarÃ© 2004, Delelis <em>et al.</em> 2007, Le Breton 2008, DromzÃ©e <em>unpubl. data</em>), suggesting that birds might still come to former breeding sites which were destroyed by mining activity or deteriorated to the point that they are no longer suitable for breeding. The species also breeds on 12 (out of 74) islets in the southern lagoon, where there are estimated to be less than 100 pairs (Pandolfi Benoit and Bretagnolle 2002, Baudat-Franceschi 2012) or even as few as 20 pairs, when only burrows with evidence of breeding are considered rather than vocal activity (Baudat-Franceschi 2012). There are signs of a substantial decline on at least one of these islets, with 50 pairs in 1986 reduced to less than 10 pairs in 1998 (Pandolfi Benoit and Bretagnolle <em>unpubl. data</em>).&#160;<br/><br/>In the non-breeding season, the species disperses widely, and birds have been recorded as far east as the coast of Central America (Ballance <em>et al.</em> 2002), particularly Peru, Mexico (Onley and Scofield 2007) and Costa Rica (R.

The threat of introduced predators could drive the species towards extinction within a very short time. For these reasons, the species qualifies as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It breeds in small, loose colonies of 10-50 pairs in burrows on steep, vegetated slopes on New Caledonia between 350 and 650 m, and among rocks and debris of cabbage tree palm <em>Livistona australis</em>&#160;or in rock scree on exposed slopes in Australia (Priddel and Carlile 1997a,b, V.

During breeding, it feeds mainly cephalopods, fish and crustaceans (McGee <em>et al. submitted</em>), taken in the Tasman Sea and in the waters off southern Australia (Priddel <em>et al. </em>2014). Banded adult birds have lived to more than 40 years of age (D. Priddel <em>in litt.</em> 2012).<p></p>","<p>Black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> have been found predating both eggs and adults and this may constitute a major threat: a previously rat-free colony declined rapidly after the invasion of rats in 2002 (V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt</em>. 2007). On New Caledonia, introduced pigs excavate chicks from burrows (F. Hannecart <em>in litt</em>. 1999) or eat chicks at fledgling time (V. Bretagnolle, <em>pers. obs</em>.). The White-winged Petrel experiences cat predation on New Caledonia and was found in 0.2-2.5% of cat scats studied (Palmas <em>et al.</em> 2017). Introduced rabbits on Cabbage Tree Island have probably changed the island's vegetation to favour increased populations of Pied Currawong, which predate White-winged Petrel, and Birdlime Trees, the fruit of which represents an entanglement risk (Priddel and Carlile 1997b). Tens of birds probably are accidentally killed annually between January and April around Noumea when they are attracted to lights; continuing urbanisation is likely to make this situation worse (SCO <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In 1995, egg abandonment on Cabbage Tree suggested unidentified marine threats, although it coincided with an Australia-wide die-off of pilchards <em>Sadinops sagax neopilchardus</em> (Priddel and Carlile 1997b, Carlile <em>et al.</em> 2003). </p>  <p></p>","Based on currently known colonies, the global population is estimated to number 3,000-21,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 2,000-14,000 mature individuals (V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000, Garnet and Crowley 2000, Priddel and Carlile 2009). However, this is pending the discovery of possible new colonies in New Caledonia.",Decreasing,"<em>Pterodroma leucoptera</em> only breeds in <strong>Australia</strong> and <strong>New Caledonia</strong> (<strong>to France</strong>). A small colony on Raivavae, Austral Islands, French Polynesia (V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000, 2016) is closer to <em>P. brevipes</em> than to <em>P. leucoptera</em>. While the two main sub populations in New Caledonia (<em>P. l. caledonica</em>) and Australia (<em>P. l. leucoptera</em>) are similar genetically, they have strong ecological distinctiveness in foraging distribution, winter distribution, breeding phenology and breeding distribution (Iglesias-V <em>et al. </em>2017). In Australia, <em>P. leucoptera</em> breeds on Cabbage Tree (0.3 km<sup>2</sup>) and adjacent Boondelbah (0.1 km<sup>2</sup>) Islands. It has also been recently found to breed on at least three sites on Broughton Island (1.3 km<sup>2</sup>) (Carlile et al. 2012) and Little Broughton Island (0.3 km<sup>2</sup>) (Carlile <em>et al.</em> 2013), 12 km northeast of Cabbage Tree and two sites 435 km south of Cabbage Tree on Montague Island (0.8 km<sup>2</sup>) (Fullagar <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Tollgates (0.1 km<sup>2</sup>) (Carlile <em>et al.</em> 2014). On Cabbage Tree, population estimates indicated a decline from 2,004 birds in 1970 to 1,157 in 1993 (Priddel and Carlile 1997b). However, conservation action undertaken since 1993 has seen the number of nesting pairs increase annually from fewer than 250 to c.1,025 in 2001, and numbers appear to be currently stable between 800-1000 pairs (Priddel and Carlile 2007, 2009). Following a translocation programme in 1999, approximately 50 pairs breed on Boondelbah (Priddel <em>et al.</em> 2006, D. Priddel <em>in litt.</em> 2012). In New Caledonia, one main breeding site of <em>caledonica</em> of 2,000-5,000 pairs is known on Mts Dzumac, another smaller breeding site (size unknown) occurs on south-eastern Dzumacs, and calling birds were found near Poya. Based on sightings at sea off New Caledonia, there may be c.1,000-10,000 pairs in total, although more colonies may lie undiscovered in isolated massifs on New Caledonia (Meeth and Meeth 1983, Bretagnolle and Thomas 1990, V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2000, Bretagnolle in Brooke 2004, V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Petrels known historically from Vanuatu (still extant at least on Erromango and Tanna) are not this species, but <em>P. brevipes</em> (V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Australian birds and New Caledonian birds disperse in different areas of central Pacific, with some birds even found western Australia (Rayner <em>et al. </em>2014). Three individuals have been sighted over the waters around Fiji (T. Pyn <em>in litt.</em> 2008), and four around the Windward Islands (Champeau 2010). Non-breeders forage in the Southern Ocean as far south as the Antarctic coast (D. Priddel <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Recent tracking studies have revealed that during the non-breeding season, both subspecies migrate across the Pacific, but use different migration routes and over-winter in different regions of the ocean; <em>leucoptera</em> in the central Pacific south of Hawaii, and <em>caledonia</em> in the Eastern Pacific west of Ecuador (Priddel <em>et al.</em>2014).<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong></p><p>On Cabbage Tree, Pisonia is being removed, rabbits have been extirpated (Priddel <em>et al. </em>2000), <em>S. graculina</em> and <em>C. coronoides</em> are controlled, and other predators are monitored (Carlile <em>et al.</em> 2003, Priddel and Carlile 2009). As a result breeding success has increased from 20% to 50% (Priddel and Carlile 2007). Two hundred fledglings have been translocated from Cabbage Tree to Boondelbah where a small colony is now established (Priddle <em>et al.</em> 2006). In New Caledonia SCO have implemented an annual campaign to save petrels which are attracted to lights (SCO <em>in litt.</em> 2007). In 2007, nine birds were found and five released alive, but numbers must be higher and SCO hopes to make this campaign a major event (SCO <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In New Caledonia, the local government previously funded a rat control program near a large breeding colony (V. Bretagnolle <em>in litt.</em> 2007).

Confirmation that introduced predators are causing a decline would result in an uplisting to Critically Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","The species is highly pelagic and rarely approaches land, except at breeding colonies. It nests in burrows on slopes in <em>Dicksonia externa</em> fern-forest, stands of low fern and adjacent grasslands and along open ridges at elevations of 600-1,150 m (J. C. Torres-Mura <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Hodum 2009, Reyes-Arriagada <em>et al.</em> 2012). One egg is laid in mid-December to early January (Hodum 2009) and chicks hatch in February-March (Hodum and Wainstein 2003).

Feral cat <em>Felis catus</em>&#160;predation has been documented and is thought to be causing population decline, with a preliminary estimate of 2-3% annual adult mortality from cat predation (Hodum 2009). Additionally, feral cats prey on near-fledging chicks when they are on the surface exercising their flight muscles, although predation rates have not been quantified (Hodum 2009). Brown rats <em>Rattus norvegicus </em>also prey on chicks, though the incidence appears low and restricted to certain habitat types (J. C. Torres-Mura <em>in litt</em>. 1999, P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2007). There is also limited evidence of predation on chicks by House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em>, but this does not appear to be widespread (Hodum 2009). Dogs also depredate the species. Goat impacts include habitat alteration through native plant consumption and also, at times, direct collapses of burrows (Hulm 1995, J. C. Torres-Mura <em>in litt. </em>1999, P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2007, J. C. Torres-Mura <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Hodum 2009). Despite attempts to reduce the goat population, it remains high (P. Hodum&#160;<em>pers. obs</em>.). Cows may also have a similar effect.</p>  <p>Flash flooding in 2002 caused severe localised habitat loss with an estimated 30,000 burrows destroyed (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). In 1995, a fire destroyed habitat at the edge of the principal colony and directly killed thousands of birds (J. C. Torres-Mura <em>in litt</em>. 1999, P. Hodum <em>in litt.</em> 2007).</p>  <p>Light pollution also represents a threat. On overcast nights, especially those with poor visibility due to rain and/or drizzle, lights in the village attract birds, occasionally causing collisions with structures in the village (Hodum 2009). The village is inhabited from September to May, during the period of lobster harvesting (P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2007).</p>  The species is potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its altitudinal distribution, currently a range of approximately 500 m, falls entirely within 2,000 m of the highest mountain top within its range (1,649 m).

However, it has a very small range when breeding (probably at fewer than five locations) and a small population, both of which are thought to be declining. It is therefore classified as Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","It nests on cliff-ledges in volcanic ash soils beneath sparse, heathy vegetation such as <em>Philippia montana</em> associated with upland elfin forest (Probst <em>et al.</em> 2000). It is a summer breeder, with most birds arriving at the colony in September; the pre-laying exodus occurs in October and birds lay synchronously in November each year. Chick-rearing starts in late December to early January and fledglings leave their colony throughout April. Breeding adults forage over a wide area between RÃ©union, the south of Madagascar and South Africa (Pinet <em>et al. </em>2012). Pre-breeding and incubating birds perform very long foraging trips up to the continental plateau of South Africa and the Walter Shoal area, 1000 km south of Madagascar. When rearing their chicks, birds adopt a dual foraging strategy with a clear alternation of short (2-3 days) trips around RÃ©union Island and long trips (10-14 days) trips to the south of Madagascar. During the non-breeding season, it forages in regions characterized by warm sea surface temperatures and low productivity, consistent with strong and reliable easterly winds, between the western South Equatorial Current and the eastern Equatorial Counter Current (Pinet <em>et al.</em> 2011a). Birds leave the colony in late March, reaching wintering areas in mid-April, returning to the colony 5th-15th September (Pinet <em>et al. </em>2011b). Both sexes, as well as breeders and non-breeders, show similar migration schedules, with males returning to the colony slightly earlier, and mean return dates coinciding with the full moon phase, suggesting that birds use this cue to synchronize their activity (Pinet <em>et al. </em>2011b). The mean distance travelled per day en route to wintering areas is 110-600 km; once there, travel distances drop significantly (Pinet <em>et al.</em> 2011b). There is considerable consistency in wintering areas year on year (Pinet <em>et al.</em> 2011b). The species feeds at the surface, taking mostly squid and fish, foraging alone or in small flocks, often associating with Sooty Terns <em>Sterna fuscata </em>and Tropical Shearwaters <em>Puffinus bailloni</em>. Diet study and stable isotope ratios suggest that young and adults consume different prey (Kojadinovic <em>et al.</em> 2009, Danckwert <em>et al. </em>2016). Its main prey are fish and squids.<p></p>","<p>Invasive mammals represent the largest threat to Barauâs Petrel. Cat predation is the most significant threat to the species with modelling indicating that the rate of predation is likely to be causing rapid population declines (Russell <em>et al.</em> 2009). Introduced rats are also a significant threat to the species, taking eggs and chicks and have been recorded at all visited breeding colonies (Pinet <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. LeCorre <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Goats and dogs are also present, however, these are thought to cause negligible declines.</p>  <p>Light pollution represents a significant threat due to the disorientation of juvenile birds and has been the target of Intensive conservation action. Light pollution is estimated to potentially lead to between 5 and 20% mortality dependent on weather and moon phase (M. LeCorre <em>in</em> <em>litt</em>. 2016); over 13,000 fledglings have been rescued since 1996 (M. LeCorre <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Widespread light pollution such as street lamps and sport installations are responsible for the vast majority of petrel light-induced mortality on RÃ©union (Le Corre <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2002).</p>  <p>Climate change may also affect the species in the future as a recent study based on a robust tracking dataset and habitat suitability modelling has shown that the wintering habitat may shift southward and may be reduced in size during the 21st century (Legrand <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>  Hunting is likely to have had a small effect on this species, causing rapid declines in a small portion of the population, but this threat is considered unlikely to return. <p></p>","Most breeding colonies of Barau's Petrel are completely out of reach and have never been assessed properly until recently. Thus, most previous population estimates and trends should be taken with caution. Recently, a combination of methods including annual census of fledglings attracted to lights from 1996 to 2016 (SEOR <em>unpublished</em>), wide scale radar survey, capture and recapture analysis at breeding colonies, study of burrow occupancy, habitat modelling (and population genetics (Danckwerts&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016) have been conducted to assess the size of the population. Such an effort has provided a preliminary estimate of 15,000 to 20,000 breeding pairs, a larger number of mature individuals than previously reported. Nevertheless, previous estimates were based only on a partial knowledge of the species.",Decreasing,"<em>Pterodroma baraui </em>nests on the Massifs of Piton des Neiges and Grand BÃ©nare, La RÃ©union (<strong>to France</strong>) (one nest has been discovered on Rodriguez; Van den Berg <em>et al.</em> 1991). Tracking research has shown that the at-sea distribution when breeding includes a wide area from Reunion to 1,000 km south of Madagascar and up to the coasts of South Africa (Pinet <em>et al</em>. 2012). After breeding, the species migrates eastward to a wide area located on both sides of the 90 East ridge (Pinet <em>et al.</em> 2011b). At sea observations in the northern Indian Ocean suggest that some birds may disperse widely throughout the tropical Indian Ocean.<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong></p><p>Since the discovery (in 1996) of the massive loss of fledglings induced by light pollution, an island scale rescue campaign has been conducted annually and has lead to the rescue of &gt;12,000 fledglings. Recent mark-recapture operations conducted at breeding colonies have shown that some of these birds are now recruiting as breeding adults, which demonstrates that rescue campaigns have a strong positive impact at the population level. A modelling study also shows that without the rescue campaign, the population would have declined at a rate of at least 1.1% per year (Le Corre <em>et al.</em> <em>in prep.</em>).</p><p>Measures to reduce light pollution, especially during the fledging period (April), have been proposed (Le Corre <em>et al.</em> 2002).

Ringing recoveries have shown that birds first return to breed four years after fledging (Madeiros <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. The breeding grounds are not visited by birds between mid-June and mid-October (Wingate 1997)<strong></strong>, with adults returning from mid-October (Madeiros 2008). Results from geolocator tags showed that individuals can cover in excess of 5,000 km during a foraging trip, following different courses from Bermuda but generally all foraging over the Gulf Stream (Madeiros <em>unpubl. data</em>)<strong></strong>. During the non-breeding season they have been recorded in the Gulf Stream, north to the Bay of Fundy, into the Gulf of St. Lawrence and over the Grand Banks, with one individual recorded 201-241 km off southwest Ireland (Madeiros 2009).<p></p>","<p>Of the threats to the species, predation by introduced species and direct hunting are likely to have been the main drivers of the historical decline, but the impact of area lost to development is unknown. Dogs, pigs, cats and rats were present and likely to be the main drivers of the dramatic decline that led to the species being considered extinct prior to 1951. Rats also represent a threat, because, since 2005, rats have managed to swim out to breeding islets on multiple occasions, including invasions of Nonsuch Island in 2015 and 2016 (N. Carlile <em>in litt</em>. 2016). So far these have been detected and the rats controlled with only minor chick mortality, but this is an ongoing threat that is only at a negligible severity due to intensive conservation interventions. A single, subadult, Snowy Owl <em>Bubo scandiacus</em>, the first ever recorded in Bermuda, on Nonsuch Island was eradicated after having eaten 5% of the population (Dickinson 2007). Swarms of feral European honeybee have taken over burrows and also killed at least one chick, but ongoing control using insecticide has been successful (Madeiros <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>The threat of sea-level rise and increased storm activity appears real, with five or more major floods affecting burrows in the 1990s, after 25 years without significant problems (Wingate <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 1998). Category three hurricane Fabian in 2003 overwashed three of the four breeding islets, damaging or destroying a significant number of nest burrows (J. Madeiros <em>in litt</em>. 2005). This, however, does not seem to have caused population level impacts.</p>  <p>Light pollution from the international airport continues, but those lights intense enough and orientated high enough to potentially cause disruption to Cahows on their breeding islets have been realigned or had hoods fitted to reduce the impact (Madeiros 2005). As a result of this, light pollution does not seem to be causing significant declines.</p>  In the past, its recovery has been hampered by competition from White-tailed Tropicbird <em>Phaethon lepturus</em> for nest-sites. Successful use of wooden 'baffles' at the entrance to burrows prevents access by White-tailed Tropicbirds alongside the provision of artificial tropicbird nest sites has relieved the pressure on Bermuda Petrel.<p></p>","In 2005, the population was thought to include 71 breeding pairs (J.

Intensive management has resulted in slow but steady increases, and the population was estimated at 250 birds in 2005 (J. Madeiros <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, with 70 pairs fledging a record 40 young in 2003 (Madeiros 2003)<strong></strong>, and 71 pairs fledging 35 young in 2005 (J.

More recently, 40 young fledged in 2008 from 85 established active nest sites and at least 35 chicks hatched in 2009 (Madeiros <em>unpubl. data</em>)<strong></strong>. By 2011, the population reached 98 nesting pairs (Madeiros 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>From 40 chicks on all islands in 2008, 21 chicks were translocated in May to Nonsuch, forming the last year of a translocation project (Madeiros 2008).

One chick was born on the island in 2009 (Madeiros <em>unpubl. data</em>)<strong></strong>. By 2011, 22 translocated birds have returned to Nonsuch, and 8 more translocated birds returned to the original nesting islets.

As part of the Bermuda Conservation Programme, potential breeding islands (e.g. Nonsuch) have been reforested with native flora in an attempt to attract nesting petrels (Wingate <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. The Castle Harbour islands are a National Park and Nature Reserve (J. Madeiros <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. In 2004 and 2005 efforts were made to attract adult Bermuda Petrels, displaced from low-lying nest burrows destroyed by hurricane Fabian, on the main breeding islet to a new artificial burrow complex built on a more elevated section of the islet. Using a combination of a sound attraction system set up among the new nests and physical translocation of adult individuals from the destroyed sites, three pairs occupied burrows in the new complex by March 2005 (J. Madeiros <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. A project has also been conducted to establish a new nesting colony on the Nonsuch Island Living Museum, which is much larger and contains more suitable breeding habitat than the present suboptimal breeding islets. The project involved physical translocation of chicks from the present breeding islets to a new complex of artificial burrows on Nonsuch, so that they would imprint on the new site and return when mature to establish their nests at the new location. In 2004, the trial year of the project took place with 14 chicks moved to Nonsuch, where they were fed and monitored every other day until departure, with all fledging successfully. In 2005, 21 chicks were translocated, with all again fledging successfully by mid-June.&#160;In 2009, the first adult-fed Bermuda Petrel for 400 years hatched on Nonsuch Island (Dobson 2009)<strong></strong>.  So far, 79 relocated chicks have fledged on Nonsuch, with only one fatality (Dickinson 2007). A Sound Attraction System was also set up in 2007 to help encourage birds to stay and prospect on Nonsuch, and overcome any tendency for young birds to be attracted back to the activity at the original nesting islets (Madeiros 2008). A total of 171 fledglings was ringed between 2002-2007, with 31 confirmed having returned (including 4 recaptured on Nonsuch Island), representing cohorts from four nesting seasons, 2002 to 2005 (Madeiros 2008). Rats have managed to get to Nonsuch (N. Carlile&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016), but so far these have been detected and the rats controlled with only minor chick mortality. Additionally, a single, subadult, Snowy Owl&#160;<em>Bubo scandiacus</em>, the first ever recorded in Bermuda, on Nonsuch Island was eradicated after having eaten 5% of the population (Dickinson 2007).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Maintain all management activities at current nesting-grounds.

All nests located to date are at high elevations (&gt;1,500 m), and while most are in inaccessible areas (steep slopes, heavily forested) some are not (E. Rupp, <em>in litt.</em>). Nesting success from monitoring over 4 years was 70-77% (n = 47 nests) with abandonment and predation causing most failures (E.

(Simons <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p></p>","<p>The increased frequency of fires represents a significant threat to the Black-capped Petrel through habitat loss, degradation and direct mortality. Fires and electric lights can cause the birds to become confused and disorientated causing mortality through collisions or grounding of the birds (Wingate 1964). Once grounded, many birds are unable to regain flight, leaving them vulnerable to predation and starvation. A number of electric communication towers are located on mountaintops close to petrel breeding grounds and are often stabilised with multiple guy wires and well lit (Goetz <em>et al.</em> 2012). These towers appear to be a considerable source of mortality, with a two-night investigation in 2013 finding several dead and grounded birds below a single tower, as well as hearing birds hitting the guy wires (A. Brown <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Mitigation efforts are in place for some towers and have greatly reduced the impact at these locations however further towers require investigation and modification (A. Brown <em>in</em> <em>litt</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Small-holder farming, cattle ranching and logging for charcoal are all significant sources of habitat loss, despite being illegal within the forests of Sierra De Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic (BirdLife International 2016). Rats and Feral cats are abundant at all known Black-capped Petrel breeding locations and, although their current impact on the species is unknown, in other ecologically similar petrels these species are responsible for nest failure and fledgling and adult mortality (Goetz <em>et al.</em> 2012). Dogs, pigs and mongoose may also predate the species. Direct consumption by humans is implicated in the extirpation of Black-capped Petrel on Martinique and Guadeloupe (Lee 2000), and this intentional use is ongoing in other areas. The gathering of terrestrial plants across the Black-capped Petrelâs range is not thought to cause significant declines.</p>  <p>Mercury concentrations in tissues from specimens of the species were found to be considerably higher than in other species studied (Whaling <em>et al.</em> 1980, Simons <em>et al</em>. 2013) but impacts are unclear and likely restricted to lowered reproductive success rather than direct mortality.</p>  <p></p>","The population is estimated as no more than 1,000 breeding pairs, perhaps as few as 500, and a total population of 2,000â4,000 birds.<p></p> <p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pterodroma hasitata</em> is confirmed as breeding in Hispaniola (comprising the nations of <strong>Haiti</strong> and the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>).

The highest density of nests and most of the population occurs on La Visite Ridge in the western extent of the Massif de la Selle, Haiti. Smaller populations occur eastward along the Massif de la Selle and across the border in the Sierra de Bahoruco of the Dominican Republic, as well as around Pic Macaya in Massif de la Hotte in western Haiti. Radar surveys and aural observations indicate that small populations occur in other areas to the north and east in the Dominican Republic but nests have yet to be located (E. Rupp <em>in litt.</em>) Taking into account each of these known and suspected breeding sites, all of which are quite small, an area of occurrence estimate of 20 km<sup>2</sup> is reasonable (E. Rupp <em>in litt.</em>).</p><p>Radar surveys conducted in Dominica in January 2015 strongly suggest that Black-capped Petrels persist there; hundreds of petrel-like targets were recorded over 17 separate coastal and inland flight corridors, and eight individual Black-capped Petrels were observed over 5 locations (Brown 2015). These data, when coupled with recent observations of downed Black-capped Petrels on the island, suggests that there are still individuals breeding on the island, although the last confirmed nesting date was 1862.</p><p>Black-capped Petrels previously nested on Guadeloupe and Martinique, but have not been documented there since before 1900. However, hope persists for rediscovery on Guadeloupe (A. Chabrolle <em>in litt.</em>) based on offshore observations and the presence of inaccessible island peaks. Likewise, hope persists for Cuba.

A compendium of about 5,000 at-sea observations indicates that waters in or adjacent to the Florida Current and the Gulf Stream between northern Florida and southern Virginia provide a distinct and relatively confined foraging range of Black-capped Petrels, with concentrations observed there throughout the year. In the Caribbean Sea, Black-capped Petrels can occur within the inter-island regions, straits and offshore zones of both the Greater and Lesser Antilles, but still primarily east of 80Â°W. The first satellite tracking of this species (three individuals) suggest a similar, but more spatially expansive range, including regular occurrence in the Caribbean Sea between Hispaniola and South America and regular occurrence east of primary foraging area indicated by the at-sea observations (Jodice <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;</p><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway&#160;</strong></p><p>An International Black-capped Petrel Conservation Group has formed and facilitates communication and coordination among researchers and conservationists concerned about the species.

Its diet comprises mainly of fish and squid, with minor proportions of crustaceans and sea-striders, feeding largely at night by surface-seizing. The breeding season begins in April or May, with individuals forming colonies in a wide variety of habitats on offshore islands.

Feral cats&#160;are considered a major driver of the present distribution of the species, for example on the Azores where breeding areas are restricted to steep cliffs wherever cats are present and local extinctions may have been caused by cat predation in the past. House Rats are present on many of the islands on which the species breeds or would be likely to breed, and, along with cats, is thought to be one of the main determinants of the current breeding distribution. In one colony on Madeira predation of Shearwater chicks by Madeiran Wall Lizards <em>Teira dugessii</em> has been recorded in up to 10% of nests, however no overall impact on colony breeding success has been found and lizard predation is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level (Matias <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p>  <p>The large colony in Desertas Island, Madeira suffers intense human exploitation for food or fish bait, which also occurs at a lower level in other North East Atlantic sites, although not in the Salvage Islands, Madeira following the declaration of the islands as a national park (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species may be at risk of incidental capture in longline fisheries, but as yet, no significant effects of bycatch on adult mortality have been documented (Waugh <em>et al</em>. 2012). Due to the speciesâ foraging habit and wide range overlapping with many commercial fishing lanes, it is thought to suffer a heightened risk of mortality from oil spills and other marine pollution.

Most eggs are laid in late May, and hatch mostly in mid to late July. Chicks fledge from November to December (ACAP 2012)<strong></strong>. In any given year, a large proportion of the population skip breeding; however, there is no discernible pattern to this behaviour, although it maybe linked to El NiÃ±o events (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Skipped breeders have lower survival rates, possibly owing to differences in the 'fitness' of individuals. Juveniles return to the colony as young as three years, but the age of first breeding is 7.5 years (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2015a)<strong></strong>. During incubation and chick-rearing, satellite-tracking data indicate foraging principally on the continental slope off the West Coast of South Island, but birds regularly visit Cook Strait, the Chatham Rise and Fiordland, and frequently forage in the mid-Tasman sea (Freeman <em>et al.</em> 1997, 2001)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>They nest on densely forested hills at 20-250 m. Burrows are usually concentrated in areas where the ground is relatively open, and where take-off areas are close by. This is one of the few remaining petrels still nesting on mainland New Zealand, possibly due to more aggressively resisting attacks from land-based predators (Brooks 2011). <strong>Diet</strong> Fisheries waste is an important dietary component, perhaps forming more than half of solid food fed to chicks during the hoki fishing season (Freeman 1998)<strong></strong>. Subsequent satellite tracking studies have suggested that dietary analysis over-estimates the amount of food scavenged from trawlers and that the species continues to forage over wider areas than those occupied by the hoki fishery. Even individuals known to forage at fishing fleets acquire a large proportion of their food elsewhere (Freeman <em>et al. </em>2001, Freeman and Wilson 2002)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p>","<p>The Westland Petrel is at risk from introduced species. A population of feral pigs has established within 20km of the breeding colonies, leading to concerns that, if the pigs discover the colonies, they will predate adults and cause habitat degradation, an issue that is exacerbated by their difficulty of eradication (Waugh and Wilson 2017). Feral dogs are present at locations very close to the breeding colonies, and vagrant dogs have killed petrels at the colonies previously (Waugh and Wilson 2017). Other predatory introduced mammals sighted in and around the colonies during 2010-2016 include Brushtail Possums, stoats <em>Mustela ermine</em> and rats <em>Rattus</em> spp. Nevertheless, productivity is relatively high, with around 65% of eggs laid fledging chicks (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2015, Waugh and Wilson 2017), suggesting that their presence may not hinder breeding success. Cats <em>Felis catus</em> are considered a more significant threat and most chick deaths recorded in the 1990s were attributed to cat predation (Wilson 2016), however the levels of predation appear low and do appear to be causing a population decline.</p>  <p>Habitat loss and degradation is also a threat. In the past, farming may have destroyed some habitat, but presently the colonies are situated on land that is too steep and difficult to access for agriculture. In 2014 tropical storm Ita destroyed or damaged up to half of the area of assessed colonies, which contained up to 75% of the breeding population (Waugh <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2015). Severe erosion following the storm continues to cause the loss of burrows (Waugh and Wilson 2017).</p>  <p>At sea these petrels overlap considerably with fisheries (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2018) and their ecological niche widens in El NiÃ±o years, indicating that food type is affected by climatic variation (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2018). Non-breeders, which spend considerable time off South America, demonstrated reduced survivorship compared to breeding individuals. This is thought to be due to the effects of bycatch, both commercial and subsistence. The behaviourally (and visually) similar Black Petrel is killed as bycatch in artisanal fisheries off Ecuador and Peru (Mangel 2012) indicating that small-scale fisheries may be a significant source of mortality. Bycatch also occurs within the foraging range of breeding birds, and the species is considered at high risk of adverse population effects here also (Richard and Abraham 2015).</p>  Human exploitation is likely to occur, with equipment used to extract chicks from burrows found in 2011, but any take is considered likely to be very limited (Waugh and Wilson 2017). The 'fallout', attraction of petrels (especially fledglings) to lights at night, may be an important threat for the species, as it causes mortality through direct collisions and grounding, although the level of mortality is unknown (Waugh and Wilson 2017).<p></p>","The most recent estimate of population size is 2,954-5,137 annual breeding pairs (Wood and Otley 2013), but given that not all individuals breed each year this is likely to be an underestimate for the number of mature individuals. Assuming that 25% of breeding age birds may skip breeding in any one year (as derived from long-term data sets on similar species) (B. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 2012), the population size is estimated at 7,877-13,698 mature individuals, rounded here to 7,900-13,700 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Following the tropical storm Ita in 2014, there was considerable damage to the breeding area, with the loss or damage of up to 50% of the major colonies, which contain up to 75% of the breeding population (Waugh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015b). Fortunately, the storm occurred before the laying period and so adults may not have been killed in their nests, unless they were visiting prior to breeding (which some birds have been reported to do) (S. Waugh&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016), and some birds have moved between impacted colonies (S. Waugh&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, the level of destruction may not equate to any decline in population, and no population data subsequent to the storm are yet available, though surveys are currently underway (S. Waugh&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).",Unknown,"<em>Procellaria westlandica</em> breeds in the densely forested coastal foothills near Punakaiki, South Island, <strong>New Zealand </strong>(Best and Owen 1976).

The level of impact on the local populations is unknown, but harvesting is likely to be contributory to limiting population size, especially in the smaller colonies. Attraction to artificial light poses another potential threat, with grounded fledglings being recorded from e.g. the Canary Islands (Rodriguez and Rodriguez 2009), however the total number killed as a result of light pollution is thought to be negligible in proportion to the global population (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014). Habitat destruction and fire-induced damage to breeding colonies in the Canary Islands is believed to impact the local population. The species is also vulnerable to oil spills (Votier <em>et al.</em> 2005), other types of marine pollution (Camphuysen<em> et al</em>. 2010), bycatch in longlines and gillnets (Å½ydelis <em>et al</em>. 2013), and collisions and displacement due to wind farms, although this is currently considered a low risk for this species (Bradbury <em>et al</em>. 2014).","In Europe (which   covers &gt;95% of the breeding range), the breeding population is estimated   to be 342,000-393,000 breeding pairs, equating to 684,000-785,000 mature individuals or 1,026,000-1,177,500   individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Cats were introduced to Socorro in the early 1970s, and more than 92% of cat scats above 500 m contain shearwater remains (J. MartÃ­nez GÃ³mez <em>in litt</em>. 1998, 1999, 2000). Most shearwaters are taken by cats when they land in parts of the forest where the understorey is practically absent (MartÃ­nez-GÃ³mez and Jacobsen 2004). The introduction of pigs to Isla Clarion in 1979 led to local extinction of the species by 1990 (Howell and Webb 1990, Everett and Pitman 1993). Subsequently pigs have been eradicated from the island and some other shearwater species (though not this species as yet) have been recorded returning to the island to breed (Wanless <em>et al</em>. 2009). Sheep and goats are destroying nesting habitat across some parts of the colonies, through overgrazing and soil compaction (Santaella and Sada 1991). However, the largest breeding grounds were found in the north and northwest of Socorroâs mountain summit where the vegetation has not been severely damaged by introduced herbivores. Feral sheep and goats were completely eradicated from Socorro in 2012, resulting in a rapid and remarkable recovery of the local vegetation cover (Ortiz-Alcaraz <em>et al.</em> 2017). Rabbits were introduced to Isla Clarion in 1979 and caused significant damage to nesting habitat and directly competed with Townsend's Shearwaters for burrows, which is likely to have hastened the extinction of the species on the island (Santaella and Sada 1991, Everett and Pitman 1993). House Mice have also been identified as having a significant negative impact on the species on Socorro (Islands Conservation <em>in prep</em>.). The presence of rats on the island has been reported, but not confirmed, however it is a likely future scenario which would be likely to drive further rapid declines (J.

The breeding season is protracted and eggs are laid asynchronously, with some pairs laying eggs while other pairs are in the midst of chick-rearing. At Southeast Farallon Island, Ashy Storm-petrels visit the colony year-round, and most breeding activity is concentrated in February through October (Ainley <em>et al</em>. 1990)<strong></strong>.  At Santa Cruz Island, Ashy Storm-petrel nesting activity spans March through December (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, S. Wolf <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Birds feed at sea on planktonic crustaceans and small fish and visit the colony at night. Foraging during the breeding season occurs mainly over continental shelves (92-98%), with aggregations coinciding spatially and seasonally with the spawning aggregations of sardines and anchovies (Adams and Takekawa 2008)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","<p>The species is threatened by increasing predation from native species. The seasonal residency of Burrowing Owls&#160;<em>Athene cunicularia</em>&#160;in the Farallons has increased, with autumn-visitant owls likely remaining through the winter due to the abundance of mice available since the eradication of rabbits has allowed more vegetation to go to seed. This has resulted in hyperpredation of Ashy Storm-petrels, especially following seasonal decreases in the mouse population (Mills 2016 and Nur <em>et al</em>. in press <em>in</em> Carter <em>et al</em>. 2016). Further declines in the Farallon colonies are thought to have occurred due to heavy predation by a large, and growing, population of Western Gulls <em>Larus occidentalis</em> (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1974, Penniman <em>et al.</em> 1990, Sydeman <em>et al</em>. 1998 <em>in</em> Carter <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>Invasive species also pose a threat. On Anacapa Island, Ashy Storm-petrels were not confirmed breeding until after the eradication of House Rats <em>Rattus rattus&#160;</em>and appeared to be restricted to the most inaccessible locations on the island, while subsequently nesting records have been found in areas accessible to researchers (Harvey <em>et al.</em> 2016). House Rats remain present on several islands on which Ashy Storm-petrel has been recorded to breed (e.g. San Clemente and San Miguel), but the current impact is unclear (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2016). Mice <em>Mus musculus&#160;</em>are also suspected to depredate eggs and chicks (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1990 <em>in</em> Angel <em>et al.</em> 2009). Introduced Barn Owls <em>Tyto alba</em>&#160;are known to predate upon Ashy Storm-petrels, representing their primary avian predator on Santa Cruz Island in 1995-1996 (McIver 2002); however, depredation by the Barn Owl was less significant in 2005-2007 (McIver et al. 2009).</p>  <p>There is strong evidence for the impact of chemical pollution on the Ashy Storm-petrel. In 1992-1997, high levels of organochlorine pollutants, such as DDT and PCBs, were found in Ashy Storm-petrel eggs at Santa Cruz Island (Fry 1994, Carter <em>et al</em>. 2008a,b). This caused extensive eggshell thinning and potentially embryo mortality, leading to low hatching success, averaging 62% on the island between 1995 and 1998. Regulations in 1970 caused a decline in ocean pollutant levels around Santa Cruz Island, implying that the levels of contamination measured in the 1990s were not representative of the historic maximum. By 2008, pollutant levels in eggs on Santa Cruz had decreased (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2008a) and mean hatching success in 2005-2007 was significantly higher than that in 1995-1998 (McIver <em>et al.</em> 2009), similar to the mean seen in the less polluted Fallarones in 1972-1983 (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1990b).</p>  <p>Rising sea levels and increasing storm surge due to climate change is an increasing concern (National Research Council 2012) due to the potential increase in flooding of low-lying nesting habitat in sea caves and offshore rocks during the breeding season. High-water events in 2008, 2010 and 2011 in the Cave of Birdsâ Eggs caused low levels of adult and chick mortality, as well as the loss of some areas of cave-floor nesting habitat (McIver <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>  <p>Storm-petrels have been demonstrated to be negatively impacted by the action of chronic and acute oil incidents, with effects extending to reduced reproductive success in the following season. However, most of the impacts do not appear to persist beyond a few years. Breeding populations are not generally suppressed, which may be explained by the recruitment of non-breeding individuals in a species that are limited by breeding sites. They are unlikely to be retrieved dead after an oil spill due to their small size and propensity for being scavenged (ATTC 2001) and, as such, will be underrepresented in counts of this type. The American Trader oil spill is thought to have had some effect on the Ashy Storm-petrel (ATTC 2001). Chronic oiling events do occur within the Ashy Storm-petrelâs range in central California, including the S.S. Jacob Luckenbach, sunk in the Gulf of the Farallones in 1954 and responsible for a number of oiling events since, as well as incidents of illegal offshore dumping of tank washing and bilge dumping (Hampton <em>et al.</em> 2003). The congregation of Ashy Storm-petrel in Monterey Bay in the autumn means major spill in this area would have the potential to affect relatively large numbers of birds (Sydeman <em>et al.</em> 1998).</p>  <p>Lights on oil rigs and fishing boats represent a significant source of light pollution, with the entire Ashy Storm-petrel population subject to the impacts of squid boat lights while foraging (McIver <em>et al. </em>2016), and 37% of the total population exposed to the effects of bright lighting on offshore energy platforms (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2015). This is likely to cause some level of mortality, but the effect on the population is unknown.</p>  Disturbance by kayakers also poses a threat to the Ashy Storm-petrel, with the lowest breeding success recorded at sites easily accessible by kayak. Natural and artificial nesting habitats are fragile and prone to movement or collapse if stepped upon. During the breeding season, which coincides with the peak numbers of kayakers, Storm-petrel adults, chicks, and eggs within nest sites are vulnerable to being crushed or disturbed by unaware human visitors (McIver <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, signs preventing tourists from entering caves have been deployed and no evidence of disturbance by the general public has been recorded since (McIver <em>et al</em>. 2011).<p></p>","The population is estimated to number 5,200-10,000 individuals, equivalent to 3,500-6,700 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Hydrobates homochroa</em> breeds on a small number of island groups and offshore rocks within the California Current System, the northernmost being off Mendocino County, California (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">U.S.A.</span>) (~39Â°N) and the southernmost at Los Coronados Islands off northern Baja California, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mexico </span>(~32Â°N) (Carter <em>et al.</em> 1992 unpublished data, McChesney <em>et al</em>. 2000, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2003, S.

The species is very philopatric, as is the rule with Procellariiformes. Adults do not commence breeding until their third year at the earliest, although most breeding recruitment tends to occur between 4 and 6 years (Oro <em>et al.</em> 2004, Genovart <em>et al. </em>2016). Birds lay eggs in early-mid March (exceptionally late February); hatching occurs in late April-early May; and adults leave the colonies around late June, a few days before the chicks fledge (early July) (Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004, Tan 2016).&#160;</p><p>The species has been recorded diving to more than 35m (Meier 2015). Pelagic prey (especially small pelagic fish) seem to be the main food source for the species. It can also feed on planktonic organisms, and makes extensive use of discards both in the Mediterranean and when in the Atlantic (Le Mao and YÃ©sou 1993, Arcos <em>et al.</em> 2000, Arcos and Oro 2002, Navarro <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2009, Louzao <em>et al</em>. 2011b, 2015, Bonnin 2016, Meier <em>et al. in press</em>). Fishing discards do though influence aspects of their ecology such as trophic (Navarro <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2009; KÃ¤kelÃ¤&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010) and movement ecology (Bartumeus&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), as well as potentially impacting life history traits&#160;(e.g. Louzao <em>et al. </em>2006b, Genovart&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;</p><p>At sea, it has a rather coastal distribution, and tends to select productive shelf areas most often related to oceanographic frontal systems (Louzao <em>et al.</em> 2006, Louzao <em>et al.</em> 2012, Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2012, PÃ©rez-Roda 2015, AfÃ¡n 2016). During breeding, birds tend to forage over the closest productive grounds to their breeding colony (Louzao <em>et al.</em> 2011a, Meier <em>et al.</em> 2015) coinciding with favourable winds during the outward stages of foraging trips (AfÃ¡n 2016). Some individuals also head to productive areas at the extreme of their distribution, assisted by optimal winds during short time windows (AfÃ¡n 2016). These productive waters are rich in small pelagic fishes (e.g. Palomera <em>et al.</em> 2007), where different types of fishing activity also co-occur and can provide substantial amounts of discards to shearwaters (Arcos and Oro 2002). The species appears to be more coastal during the non-breeding period (Arcos and Oro 2002; MouriÃ±o <em>et al</em>. 2003; Arcos<em> et al</em>. 2012a; Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2012), forming large aggregations that vary in location between (and within) years, presumably due to fluctuations in the availability of schools of small pelagic fish (e.g. Le Mao and YÃ©sou 1993).</p><p></p>","<p>This is a long-lived species and therefore the main threats to this species identified are those causing adult mortality. Adult survival is the main conservation concern, as this is unusually low for a Procellariiform (Oro <em>et al</em>. 2004, Genovart <em>et al</em>. 2016). The greatest threat at present is incidental capture by artisanal fisheries. Bycatch affects both adults and immatures, throughout the speciesâ range, and has been shown to be the main driver of the decline of the species, with almost 50% of the mortality being caused by this factor (Genovart <em>et al</em>. 2016). Small scale vessels have been found to have an average bycatch rate almost 100 times higher than that observed on board medium-scale vessels (Tarzia <em>et al</em>. 2017). Demersal longlining seems to be the most problematic gear causing bycatch, although other fishing gears have been shown to also capture birds, and could have severe effects at the population level, including purse-seine, pelagic longlining and trawling (Arcos <em>et al</em>. 2008, AbellÃ³ and Esteban 2012, BouÃ© <em>et al</em>. 2013, ICES 2013, Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2015). The species' gregarious behaviour and its close association with fishing boats while seeking discards means that occasional mass mortality is likely to occur when long-line boats fish close to flocks (Arcos <em>et al</em>. 2008, Laneri <em>et al</em>. 2010, GarcÃ­a-Barcelona <em>et al</em>. 2010). Hence, bycatch appears to be fairly common, but often occurs on an irregular basis, suggesting that estimates derived from observations on a limited number of trips on board fishing vessels could be largely underestimated. Increasing evidence on this has been compiled in the last few years, with events of up to a hundred or more birds caught in a single event (Louzao <em>et al</em>. 2011, ICES 2013, Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p><p>Predation by introduced mammals is a major global concern for seabirds (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2008, Croxall <em>et al</em>. 2012), and a serious threat for this species. Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus </em>and Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em>, Feral Cats <em>Felis catus </em>and Common Genets <em>Genetta genetta </em>are present in c. 25% of the colonies and affect c. 38% of the breeding population (Arcos and Oro 2004, Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004, Arcos <em>et al</em>. 2012c). Cat predation is thought to drive rapid declines locally and genets are occasional visitors with less clear levels of impact. The presence of rats is more widespread but has a lower impact, putatively affecting only breeding performance (depredating eggs and chicks, but not affecting adult mortality). Permanent monitoring programmes should be implemented to facilitate early detection of alien species in reference colonies. </p><p>    </p><p>Due to the congregatory behaviour of the species, acute pollution events, such as oil spills, also pose a serious threat, as a large number of casualties could result from a spill occurring in a congregation area (Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004, GutiÃ©rrez 2011). Other threats include: the reduction of prey due to fishing overexploitation; a potential reduction in fishing discards (an alternative to the overexploited natural prey) and/or anthropogenic environmental change (Arcos 2011a) involving habitat degradation and disturbance in breeding grounds; background pollution (Oro <em>et al</em>. 2008); the development of marine windfarms (Arcos 2011a); light pollution which may disorientate and ground fledglings (RodrÃ­guez <em>et al</em>. 2015) and plastic pollution (Codina-Garcia <em>et al</em>., 2013, Bonnin 2016). Predation by Peregrine Falcons <em>Falco peregrinus</em> in the breeding colonies has also been recently reported (GarcÃ­a 2009, Wynn <em>et al</em>. 2010), though this should be considered as a factor of natural mortality that likely has little influence on the decline of the species. The gradual northward movement of the non-breeding population may be affecting immature and adult survival, and this shift may be due to climate change or alterations in fish distributions as a result of fisheries' activities (YÃ©sou 2003, Wynn <em>et al</em>. 2007). The recent demographic decline has not yet decreased the species' genetic variability, and connectivity found among colonies at least does not exacerbate the species' extinction risk (Genovart <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;</p><p></p>","Estimates for the breeding population size in the last two decades ranged from about 2,000 to 4,500 pairs (Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004, Arcos <em>et al.</em> 2011), with the current official figure being 3,142 pairs (ACAP 2012). This includes: Mallorca 900, Menorca 405, Cabrera 475, Ibiza 650, Formentera 712. However, these figures should only be taken as indicative, as breeding sites are often inaccessible, and therefore their census relies on indirect methods (e.g. counts of rafts, vocalisations, etc.) that are subject to strong biases and inaccuracy. This calls for particular caution in inferring population trends from such data, as estimates from one year to another might simply vary because of changes in methodological assumptions, people involved, environmental conditions during counts, or simply subjective perceptions. In fact, recent research at sea using two approaches (boat-based surveys and coastal counts at the Gibraltar Strait migration bottleneck) point to a global population of about 25,000 individuals, suggesting that the breeding population could be larger than previously assumed (Arcos <em>et al</em>. 2012b, Arroyo <em>et al.</em> 2014). Starting from these global figures, and assuming that the population structure was at equilibrium, Genovart <em>et al</em>. (2016) inferred a breeding population size of about 7,200 pairs, although this optimistic figure should also be taken with caution.",Decreasing,"<p>The species breeds exclusively in the Balearic Islands, <strong>Spain</strong>, occupying the five major island groups: Menorca, Mallorca, Cabrera, Ibiza and Formentera. During the breeding period (late February - early July) the main foraging areas are located along the Mediterranean shelf of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly around the central Catalan coast, the Ebro Delta-Columbretes area and the Cape Nao (Arcos and Oro 2002, Louzao <em>et al. </em>2006a, Arcos <em>et al</em>. 2012a, Meier <em>et al.</em> 2015), with individuals potentially exploiting the closest productive areas to their breeding colonies (Louzao <em>et al.</em> 2011a). Some birds also exploit foraging grounds at the extreme of their distribution in the continental shelf off Algeria and Morocco as well as in the Gulf of Lion (Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004, Louzao <em>et al.</em> 2012, Meier <em>et al. </em>2015, AfÃ¡n 2016), in addition to the waters around the Balearic archipelago (Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004, Louzao <em>et al</em>. 2011b). The bulk of the population leaves the Mediterranean after breeding, and concentrates off the Atlantic coasts of SW Europe in summer-autumn, mainly in Spain, Portugal and France, and also southwestern UK and northwestern Morocco (Le Mao and YÃ©sou 1993, Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004, RamÃ­rez <em>et al.</em> 2008, Arcos <em>et al. 2</em>009, Guilford <em>et al</em>. 2012, PÃ©rez-Roda 2015). Birds return to the western Mediterranean in autumn (mainly October), and spend the winter months roughly in the same foraging areas used during the breeding period (Le Mao and YÃ©sou 1993, Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004, Guilford <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p><p>At one population, on Menorca, which shows evidence of past hybridisation with the closely related Yelkouan shearwater (<em>Puffinus yelkouan</em>), migratory behaviour and breeding phenologies appear to be intermediate with Yelkouanâs, with a majority of birds apparently remaining in the western Mediterranean post-breeding (Meier 2015).&#160;</p><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>All breeding sites are currently protected as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the Natura 2000 network, with the unique exception of the colony of Punta Prima in Formentera, where new information has revealed that the prevailing colony lays right outside the SPA (and the overlapping Important Bird Area, IBA) designated for this species (Arcos 2011a). The management plans for the Balearic SPAs have not been implemented yet, and so plans are therefore limited to colonies covered by other designations, such as the National Park of Cabrera, the Natural Park of Sa Dragonera and Reserves Naturals des VedrÃ , es Vedranell i els illots de Ponent, among others. Rat eradication campaigns have been conducted at several colonies, including Cabrera archipelago and Dragonera Island, where, after a programme of aerial bait drops in 2011, no rats or mice had been detected (Mayol <em>et al. </em>2012). Less effort has been directed at the most concerning colonies where carnivores are present (e.g. Formentera and Menorca).&#160;<br/><br/>At sea, the Spanish Government designated in 2014 a network of marine SPAs taking as a reference the inventory of marine IBAs conducted by SEO/BirdLife (Arcos <em>et al.</em> 2009). Portugal also designated a few SPAs on the mainland coast recently, including congregatory areas for the Balearic shearwater previously identified as IBAs by SPEA (RamÃ­rez <em>et al</em>. 2008). France has also proposed a network of SPAs that include hotspots for the species. However, management plans for all the marine SPAs are still pending. Finally, evidence gathering for potential at-sea concentrations which could form SPA proposals are underway in the UK.&#160;<br/><br/>Action Plans for the species have been published at local, national or international level in 1991, 1999, 2004, 2005 (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2008) and 2011 (Arcos 2011). A LIFE project for the species ran from 1991-2001 (Ruiz and MartÃ­ 2004), and Spain and Portugal had a joint LIFE project running from 2004-2008 aimed at identifying marine IBAs, including for this species (RamÃ­rez <em>et al.</em> 2008, Arcos <em>et al.</em> 2009). A number of actions have been implemented through Species Guardians SEO/BirdLife and SPEA as part of BirdLife's Preventing Extinctions Programme including: coordinated coastal and boat-based counts, gathering information to assess the impact of bycatch on the species, communicating and disseminating information on the species and contributing to the updated Species Action Plan published in 2011 (SEO/Birdlife and SPEA 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>For demersal longlines, the most alarming fishery in the Mediterranean, significant work has been conducted in recent years at assessing the problem (GarcÃ­a-Barcelona&#160;<em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2010, Laneri&#160;<em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em>&#160;2010, CortÃ©s&#160;<em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;in prep) and testing potential mitigation measures (CortÃ©s and Gonzalez-SolÃ­s in prep), with nocturnal setting being a good candidate to minimize bycatch. However,&#160;work by BirdLifeâs Seabird Task Force (STF) is studying the feasibility of implementing such measures, as well as other alternatives, with the aim of pushing for the adoption of an agreed solution in the near future, and has instead found that vertical longlines may be the best approach (Tarzia <em>et al. </em>2017). The STF has also conducted engagement work with the fishing sector, conducting observations on board vessels and providing self-reporting logbooks (Tarzia <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>Despite the above advances, there is an overall lack of proper monitoring and conservation action by the relevant administrations. Most research, conservation and monitoring at present are conducted thanks to the initiative of a few research centres and NGOs (particularly BirdLife partners). This work includes bycatch assessment (questionnaires, onboard observers) and evaluation of mitigation measures, the identification of hotspots at sea through boat surveys, coastal counts and tracking studies (breeding and non-breeding grounds), and breeding monitoring and population demography assessment.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Create a working group for the conservation plan, involving local and national bodies including representatives of the fishing industry. Thoroughly study the problem of bycatch by fisheries, plus implement appropriate mitigation measures throughout the whole distribution range of the species in order to mitigate this threat (i.e. implementation of the EU Seabird Action Plan to reduce bycatch). Control and eradicate introduced predators (with particular emphasis on carnivores) in breeding colonies identified to be at risk. Implement biosecurity measures to prevent introduced predators from re-establishing. Ensure effective protection for nesting sites and marine hotspots, and the implementation of monitoring schemes and management plans, including the monitoring of breeding colonies to estimate demographic parameters. Develop a rapid response plan for a potential oil spill close to main feeding and breeding areas. Continue to raise awareness among<strong>&#160;</strong>the fishing sector, and conduct further engagement with stakeholders. Study small pelagic fish populations in the western Mediterranean and in North East Atlantic (from the NW of Morocco to the English Channel) to assess extent of over-exploitation and how this affects the species. Assess the impact of pollutants and heavy metals on this species. Increase awareness of the negative impacts of light pollution near breeding colonies. Improve understanding of at-sea distribution, including during the non-breeding season. Conduct research to better understand the reasons for the discrepancies between breeding and non-breeding population estimates.<p></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Breeding starts in April on barren offshore islands, where breeding pairs occupy cliffs, caves and boulder fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Breeding individuals in the Canary Islands show a unimodal foraging strategy, concentrating on highly productive regions of the African continental shelf (Navarro and GonzÃ¡lez-SolÃ­s 2009). Diet is mostly squid, which are obtained mainly by surface-seizing. The species is regularly attracted to trawlers to feed on offal (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","The primary threats to this species include interaction with small- (and large-) scale fisheries, and predation by invasive, non-native species. Together with <em>C. diomedea</em>, it is the main seabird species caught as bycatch by the Spanish longline fleet in the western Mediterranean (BÃ¡ez <em>et al.</em> 2014). A study by Ramos <em>et al.</em> (2012), utilising long-term capture-recapture data and year-round tracking data for birds on Selvagem Grande, suggests that incidental bycatch by longline fisheries contributes to a decrease in adult survival probability during the breeding season. The species may also suffer the impacts of bycatch in its non-breeding range (e.g. Granadeiro <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, fledglings suffer direct persecution on the Canary Islands, with negative effects on breeding success (Lopez-Darias <em>et al</em>. 2011), and c. 500-1,500 chicks poached annually on the Azores (Fontaine <em>et al.</em> 2011). A range of invasive predators are present in the speciesâ range, but their impacts have largely been unaccounted for. The effect of rats on the species not fully understood. In some colonies a high abundance of rats has been shown to have significant negative effects on reproductive success, while in others the opposite effect has been found and is attributed to the rats providing an alternative food source for cats, thereby reducing pressure on chicks (Thibault 2005). Pascal <em>et al.</em> (2008) found a substantial difference in breeding success of Coryâs Shearwaters in areas with (0.82%) and without (0.45%) rat control (see also Thibault 1995). Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> predate large numbers of juveniles and chicks in colonies on the Azores and Madeira, however the impact on breeding success has not been comprehensively assessed (Hervias <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2013). Predation of eggs and chicks by House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> is thought to cause slow but significant reductions in breeding success in parts of the range (Hervias <em>et al</em>. 2013). In one colony, chicks are predated by Madeiran Wall Lizards <em>Teira dugessii</em> which have been recorded in up to 10% of nests, but no overall impact on breeding success has been found (Matias <em>et al</em>. 2009). Lizard predation appears to be a local phenomenon and is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level. Light pollution, and consequent grounding, predominantly of immature individuals, is another threat contributing to the slow, steady decline of the species across its range (Fontaine <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The European population is estimated at 252,000-253,000 pairs, which equates to 504,000-507,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species breeds in the Azores and Madeira (&gt;85% of the  global population, plus a few pairs on the Berlengas Islands off the Portuguese mainland), <strong>Portugal</strong>, and on the Canary Islands, <strong>Spain </strong>(c.15% of the global population [Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006, DerhÃ© 2012]). The vast majority of the population spends the non-breeding season in the Atlantic.<br/>A population  recovery is reported for Selvagem Grande (Savage Islands, Madeira archipelago), the largest colony of Cory's Shearwaters in the world, with an  estimated increase of 4.6% per year since 1980 (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006).  This follows a series of mass culling events in the 1970s, carried out  by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen, which reduced the colony by c.90%  from c.140,000 pairs. Since 1977, strict protection has been enforced  and the population started a steady recovery; however, between 1995 and<em> </em>1998  a decline of more than 13% was reported, before monitoring work was  interrupted. Following fieldwork in 2005, the colony was estimated to  number c.30,000 pairs (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006), which implies  an overall decline of c.110,000 pairs since the mid-20th century.  Following the surveys in 2005, it was estimated that assuming an annual growth  rate of 5%, it would take another 35 years for the colony to reach its  numbers prior to the culling events (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006). The largest colony in the Azores is on the island of Corvo, where the latest population estimate was &gt;6,000 pairs (3,735-10,524) in 2012; however, the colony may have been much larger in the past (Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p>The population trend is difficult to determine owing to gaps in the data, and is therefore considered unknown according to the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015).

However, rapid  declines have been reported in the Azores (43% decline during 1996-2001; Bolton 2001) which may be caused by  inter-annual variation in colony attendance (Jenouvrier <em>et al. </em>2005), along with behavioural differences between census years (Bolton 2001, Fontaine <em>et al. </em>2011).

In Spain, sporadic counts of breeding populations  occur in some colonies, mostly in the Balearic Islands, but in the  Columbretes counts are more regular. Reproductive success is also  monitored in the Chafarinas (MadroÃ±o <em>et al</em>. 2004). A study of the  incidental mortality of seabirds in waters around the Columbretes  Islands (SEO/BirdLife, General Secretariat of Fisheries) found high  numbers of this species were killed by longline fisheries; however,  mortality could be reduced by avoiding setting lines around sunrise and  sunset (Belda and Sanchez 2001). Research projects and awareness  campaigns, some of which were financed through the LIFE Programme have  taken place in Portugal (Cabral 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: Adequate  protection (e.g. through SPAs) of all breeding areas, both current and  historical, should be ensured. Actively managing the breeding colonies  (eliminating predators, recreating the breeding habitat) and removing  predators from the former breeding colonies to promote the natural  return of the species, will also help secure the species. The proper use  of corrective measures in longline fisheries to avoid accidental  capture of birds should be promoted and specific corrective measures to  prevent accidental capture of the species in longline fisheries should  be developed, in collaboration with the fishing industry. Marine areas  which are important for the conservation of the species should be  designated SPAs. Assessments of the environmental impact of new  developments and activities that are planned need to be established. National censuses of this species should be conducted and breeding colonies monitored to determine accurate population trends. Water sports in the vicinity of  breeding colonies should be regulated, especially at night, in order to  avoid disturbing the birds. The regulation of artificial lighting in the  breeding areas and adjacent coastal areas is important to minimize their impact  particularly on young birds at the time of fledging (MadroÃ±o <em>et al</em>. 2004).",Afrotropical|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Its diet is poorly known, but thought to consist of small fish and squid, and it generally feeds on prey of a higher trophic level than <em>H. castro</em> (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>.<br/><strong> <p></p></strong>","<p></p>  <p>The two known breeding islets are currently free of introduced mammalian predators. They are, however, only 1km offshore of the inhabited island of Graciosa, and the large number of summer tourists to one of the islets means the introduction of rodents is a possibility (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2016). Further to this, a cargo ship containing livestock ran aground on one of the breeding islets in 2000, leading to concerns over pollution and rodents escaping ashore (Bolton <em>et al</em>. 2008). Madeiran Wall Lizards, introduced to the Azores in the 19th Century, have been noted predating large chicks on Praia Islet (Neves <em>et al.</em> 2017). The predation appears to be a recent behavioural change and may currently only be carried out by a few individuals. As the majority of the global population of Monteiro's Storm-petrel breed on the islet, as such, this novel source of chick predation has the potential to cause significant declines (Oliveiro <em>et al. </em>2016, Neves <em>et al</em>. 2017). High predation rates of adults by the native Northern Long-eared Owl <em>Asio otus</em> have been reported, which, given the small global population of <em>H. monteiroi</em>, may prevent population expansion (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, this natural predation is unlikely to drive significant declines. Inter-specific competition for natural nesting cavities with Coryâs Shearwaters is known to result in increased mortality for the smaller petrel species (Bried and Neves 2015), the impact of this has not been evaluated (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2016). There has, however, been a six-fold increase in the number of nesting attempts using artificial nests on Praia Islet between 2000 and 2011, with the number of attempts made in natural nests not changing over the same period (Bried and Neves 2015). Further to this, overall breeding success between 2000 and 2007 was significantly higher in artificial nests (Bried and Neves 2015). This will likely reduce the impact of competition for nesting cavities, as the artificial nests cannot be excavated by Coryâs Shearwaters (Bried and Neves 2015).</p>  Light pollution is likely to disorient a small number of fledglings each year, though this has not been documented for Monteiro's Storm-petrel as yet (Oliveiro <em>et al.</em> 2016) and the colonies are not adjacent to areas of considerable light pollution. Hence, the current threat is unlikely to exceed a negligible impact. Both of the known breeding islets lie within 2 km of the main shipping route for large passenger ferries and container ships docking on Graciosa, which can potentially cause disturbance, habitat degradation and mortality. Historically, this species was heavily hunted for food, with early 16th and 17th century accounts from the Azores of a small black and white seabird that was killed nightly by the thousands (Bolton <em>et al. </em>2008). This threat, however, is highly unlikely to return on this scale.","The population was estimated at 300 pairs in 1999 (Bolton <em>et al</em>. 2008). Recently, the Praia islet population size was updated to 178 breeding pairs, resulting in a global population size estimated at 328-378 pairs (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2016). Although the estimate for the population other than Praia islet is now a decade old, the population is not thought to have declined since. The Praia population increased in response to the installation of artificial nest boxes. Thus, the population is best placed in the band 250-999 mature individuals. This equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Stable,"The species breeds on three islets (Praia, Baixo and Baleia) situated off Graciosa Island, and other two very small islets (Alagoa) located off Flores Island Azores, <strong>Portugal</strong>. Breeding is suspected on further islets (including some stacks off Corvo Island) in the Azores, but proof is still lacking (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008, J. Bried <em>in litt.</em> 2010, Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2016). It is thought to remain in the vicinity of the Azores during the non-breeding season, a suggestion which is supported by the analysis of carbon isotopes (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Although unlikely to occur elsewhere, identification amongst Madeiran Storm-petrel <em>H. castro</em> is difficult (W. Bourne <em>in litt.</em> 2012). The total population size was estimated at 250-300 pairs in 1999 (Bolton <em>et al. </em>2008). Recently, the Praia islet population size was updated to 178 breeding pairs, resulting in a global population size estimated at 328-378 pairs (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2016). Accounts from the 16th and 17th centuries of a small black and white seabird, which appear to match the breeding cycle of this species, indicate that it may have once been far more abundant (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008); however, there are no recent trend data.&#160;<em><p></p></em>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong>Bern Convention Appendix II. Praia and Baixo islets are Special Protected Areas and natural reserves (Baixo Islet Natural Reserve and Praia Islet Natural Reserve). In 2008, both islets together with Baleia Islet were included in the Graciosa Natural Park, a fact which provides them with regional legal protection (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2016). Recent work to reduce interspecific competition for nest cavities with rabbits and other larger procellariiform species through the installation of nest boxes has met with considerable success, leading to a large increase in annual productivity (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Nest boxes had higher productivity than natural nest sites, probably due to the greater degree of protection they provided from inclement weather and interspecific competition for nest space (Bried <em>et al.</em> 2009). Data from a MRR ringing study is being analysed, with preliminary results suggesting annual survival is high (F. Jiguet <em>in litt.</em> 2010).

Breeding starts in April on barren offshore islands, where breeding pairs occupy cliffs, caves and boulder fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).

It is regularly attracted to trawlers to feed on offal (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","<p>The high rates of bycatch mortality in adults, principally within artisanal longline operations, are considered sufficient to be driving substantial and rapid population declines in the population (Belda and Sanchez 2001, Garcia-Barcelona <em>et al.</em> 2010, Laneri <em>et al</em>. 2010, CortÃ©s and GonzÃ¡lez-SolÃ­s 2018). It is one of the most frequent seabird species in Mediterranean bycatch (Valeiras and Caminas 2003, GarcÃ­a-Barcelona <em>et al.</em> 2010, Laneri <em>et al.</em> 2010), with estimates of the number of individuals killed annually by Spanish fleets ranging from 200 (GarcÃ­a-Barcelona <em>et al.</em> 2010) to 467-1,867, amounting to c. 4-6% of the local breeding population (Belda and Sanchez 2001). Together with <em>Calonectris borealis</em>, it is the most common seabird species caught as bycatch by the Spanish long-line fleet in the western Mediterranean (BÃ¡ez <em>et al</em>. 2014). Results from a questionnaire suggest an annual bycatch of up to 1,220 individuals by Maltese fleets (8.5-10% of the breeding population), although this is could be an over-estimate, skewed by high bycatch in a small number of vessels (Dimech <em>et al. unpubl. per</em> DerhÃ© 2012). The species may also suffer significant bycatch in its non-breeding range (e.g. Granadeiro <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> have negative impacts on a majority of the population, causing increased mortality and reduced reproductive success.

It breeds on oceanic islands and rocky offshore islets, occupying cliffs and earthy slopes, usually with little more than herbaceous vegetation, or amongst rocks. In the north-east Atlantic, it breeds mainly late February to March (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014). It breeds from late January. Birds from the Salvages (Madeira) arrive at colonies in July. The species is colonial, often nesting at low densities and in small numbers, sometimes in mixed colonies with other species, for example <em>Calonectris diomedea</em>, which out-competes the present species for burrows in the Azores (Monteiro <em>et al</em>. 1996). It nests in rock crevices or self-excavated burrows. The clutch is a single egg. It feeds mainly on fish, squid and crustaceans. Little is known about the speciesâs movements. Adults are thought to be largely sedentary, while immatures are probably more dispersive (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Introduced House Rats <em>Rattus rattus </em>pose a considerable threat to this species, as demonstrated by the increased breeding success (from 0 to 85-90%) following rat control programmes on the Sainte-Anne Islets, French West Indies (Pascal <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species is also vulnerable to human disturbance and developments. Habitat destruction may have been responsible for some local extinctions and near-extinctions. Mortality from attraction to artificial lights and subsequent grounding has been reported on the Canary Islands (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014). Other potential threats include marine pollution, harvesting for consumption, bycatch by fisheries, development for tourism and recreational activities (MadroÃ±o <em>et al</em>. 2004).","The nominate subspecies has been estimated to number 7,400-20,500 pairs (Mackin 2016), with subspecies <em>boydi</em> estimated at 5,000 pairs on the Cape Verde Islands, and subspecies <em>baroli</em> numbering 895-1,741 pairs on the Azores (BirdLife International 2015), c.1,642 pairs in the Madeira region (BirdLife International 2015)&#160;(most recent estimate of c.300 pairs in the Desertas Islands, 1,500-2,200 in the Savage Islands [reviewed by Brooke 2004])&#160;and c.400 pairs and declining in the Canary Islands (RodrÃ­guez <em>et al. </em>2012, BirdLife International 2015).

Aquatic vegetation (mainly <em>Myriophyllum elatinoides</em>) on the breeding lakes is essential material for floating nests and as habitat for several aquatic invertebrates that form its basic diet<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Chebez 1994). During the first week after hatching, chicks are fed with aquatic beetles (<em>Limnaea </em>spp.)<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994). The species breeds in colonies of up to 130 pairs from October to March<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994), but has an exceedingly low reproductive rate with an average of 0.2 young reared per adult per year (O'Donnell and FjeldsÃ¥ 1997). However, while potential resources for breeding are apparently limited, the resources for adult survival appear to be plentiful, and under natural circumstances adult mortality may be extremely low (O'Donnell and FjeldsÃ¥ 1997). It occasionally establishes colonies in areas marginal to its main range (O'Donnell and FjeldsÃ¥ 1997). Individuals tend to have a high fidelity towards the plateaus where they were born (Roesler <em>et al.</em> 2016).<p></p>","The principal threats to the species appear to be introduced American Mink <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neovison vison,&#160;</span>salmon and trout and climate change (S. Imberti <em>in litt.</em> 1999,&#160;Imberti and CasaÃ±as 2010,&#160;CasaÃ±as<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2013, Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/>American Mink threaten the species at all stages of its life, with nests, chicks and adults all vulnerable to predation (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Fasola and Roesler 2018). In 2010-2011, an American Mink<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span> killed more than half the adults in a breeding colony of two dozen nests on the Buenos Aires plateau (Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a). Further losses to lone mink occurred in 2012-2013, with 15 adults and 7 juveniles killed at El Cervecero and 10 adults and 5 chicks killed at the very remote C199 colony in La Siberia plateau (<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>CasaÃ±as&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Given that the Buenos Aires plateau currently holds a large proportion of the population, the presence of American Mink is a serious threat (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Furthermore, American Mink are known to exhibit 'surplus killing', which means that the presence of a single animal could result in the loss of whole grebe colonies (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Efforts to eradicate American Mink are complicated by its dispersal behaviour, with young males dispersing widely and re-occupying lakes (Fasola and Roesler 2018).<br/><br/>Recently, the introduction of trout has been correlated with a decline in breeding numbers at certain lakes (S. Imberti&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006,&#160;Konter 2008)<strong></strong>. These exotic salmonids compete for food with the Hooded Grebe and modify lake conditions, increasing levels of cyanobacteria which may be harmful to grebes (Lancelotti<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Izaguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Francisco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>Surveys between 2006 and 2013 found a number of lakes completely dry, and water levels at known breeding sites were 2-3 m lower than in previous years<strong></strong>&#160;(Konter 2008, Imberti and CasaÃ±as 2010, Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a, CasaÃ±as&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Anecdotal reports indicated reduced winter snowfall without a corresponding increase in precipitation at other times<strong></strong>&#160;(Konter 2008). Research has indicated that lower water levels exacerbate the detrimental impact of introduced fish on the lake conditions and thus on the grebes (Izaguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Given the small size of the population, the failure of an entire colony's breeding effort due to exceptionally high winds, as observed in 2013 at La Siberia, is another potentially serious threat (CasaÃ±as&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The apparent increase in the incidents of these exceptional winds over the last two decades (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) may be related to overgrazing and/or climate change (Imberti and CasaÃ±as 2010).<br/><br/>Excessive grazing by sheep (which causes erosion at lakeshores and limits the growth of emergent vegetation), predation by Kelp Gulls <em>Larus dominicanus</em> at some lakes and attacks by Flying Steamerducks <em>Tachyeres patachonicus</em>&#160;(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, O'Donnell and FjeldsÃ¥ 1997, Imberti and CasaÃ±as 2010, Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). The population may be limited by the carrying capacity of rather few lakes with good nest vegetation (O'Donnell and FjeldsÃ¥ 1997). Volcanic eruptions in the breeding area may have a negative short-term effect because of heavy ash fall, but a long-term positive effect on the productivity of the wetlands (O'Donnell and FjeldsÃ¥ 1997). There is oil exploitation on the potential migration route to the Atlantic<strong></strong>&#160;(S. Imberti&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999). Light pollution from cities, as well as oil exploitation and mining, may pose a threat on migration routes (Roesler <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Poor habitat conditions in breeding lakes may have increased competition for nest sites with other waterfowl species (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015). By-catch from fisheries may pose a threat in the winter range (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2016b). The planned construction of two hydroelectric dams on the Santa Cruz River may cause changes to the species's wintering habitats and food availability, thereby threatening the species's wintering areas (Aves Argentinas 2016, Roesler <em>et al. </em>2018a). Research has indicated that although the species winters at three estuaries, before returning to their breeding grounds they congregate at the Santa Cruz-Chico estuary, with almost 95% of the total population recorded there in August 2016 (Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a), meaning that any impact of dams on this estuary could have a great impact on the population.","In 2013, a simultaneous count across all plateaus known to have ever held grebes and visiting virtually every lake with historic records of the species, resulted in a count of 691 adults and 144 chicks in 12 colonies (CasaÃ±as<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). During the summer of 2014/2015, 771 adults, 138 juveniles and 12 colonies were recorded across 18 lakes (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys during the breeding season in 2015/2016,&#160;&#160;2016/17&#160;and 2017/18&#160;counted 753, 749 and 776 adults, respectively (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b, 2017, 2018b). The total population is therefore estimated at 650-800 mature individuals.",Stable,"This species&#160;breeds on a few basaltic lakes in the interior of Santa Cruz, extreme south-west <strong>Argentina</strong>. The only known wintering grounds are located at the estuaries of rÃ­o Coyle, rÃ­o Gallegos and rÃ­o Chico on the Atlantic coast of Santa Cruz (Johnson and Serret 1994<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>,<strong> </strong>Imberti <em>et al</em>. 2004, Roesler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011b)<strong></strong>.

Saiter and F. Schmitt <em>in litt</em>. 2013, Donoso <em>et al.</em> 2015, Roesler 2015). The total population was estimated at 3,000-5,000 individuals in the mid-1980s, with half of these on Meseta de Strobel (FjeldsÃ¥ 1984, O'Donnell and FjeldsÃ¥ 1997). Counts on the wintering grounds suggest a decline of 40% over a period of seven years (S. Imberti <em>in litt</em>. 2006). Surveys conducted in December 2006 and January 2009, which revisited key known breeding sites surveyed in 1987 (Lagunas del Sello, del Islote and Tolderia Grande) and 1998 (Encadenadas), also found sharp declines; numbers fell from 452 to 51 at Laguna del Sello, from 700 to 0 at Laguna del Islote, from 90 to 0 at Tolderia Grande<strong></strong> (H. CasaÃ±as <em>in litt</em>. 2009) and from 198 to 0 at Lagunas Encadenadas<strong></strong> (Konter 2008). While there is speculation that numbers fluctuate dramatically at breeding sites from year to year driven by movements rather than actual population fluctuations (FjeldsÃ¥ 1986), overall declines detected on the wintering and breeding grounds appear to have been real and rapid (Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011b). In both the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 breeding seasons, the species was most abundant on three plateaus: Buenos Aires, Strobel and Siberia,&#160;with five lakes holding almost 85% of the population (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Comparing the total counts made across the same 58 lagoons in 1984-5 (2,352 individuals) and 2010-11 (471 individuals) suggests an overall population reduction of 80% over 26 years, most of which occurred in the Strobel plateau (Roesler <em>et al. </em>2012, Roesler 2016). In 2013, greater resources allowed a simultaneous count across all plateaus known to have ever held grebes and visiting virtually every lake with historic records of the species, resulting in a count of 691 adults and 144 chicks in 12 colonies (CasaÃ±as<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). During the summer of 2014/2015, 771 adults, 138 juveniles and 12 colonies were recorded across 18 lakes (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Three new lakes holding the species were identified; however, on the Strobel plateau the number of lakes holding the species decreased. Surveys during the breeding season in 2015/2016,&#160;&#160;2016/17&#160;and 2017/18&#160;counted 753, 749 and 776 adults, respectively&#160; (Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b, 2017, 2018b).&#160;<p></p>",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Aves Argentinas is Species Guardian for Hooded Grebe and, along with the local NGO Ambiente Sur, is coordinating the conservation effort. Patagonia National Park was created in 2014, covering 52,000 ha that includes over half of the breeding colonies&#160;(Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015). The site where the species was discovered in 1974, Laguna Los Escarchados, was declared a reserve in 1979, but is now known to hold only a marginal population (O'Donnell and FjeldsÃ¥ 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Comprehensive surveys have taken place to locate all breeding colonies with ongoing monitoring to assess breeding success and mortality. Surveys of the breeding population have taken place annually since 2009 (Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b). Surveys of wintering birds have been carried out along estuaries of the Atlantic coast (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2018b). Research on the species's migration routes is underway, with the use of colour rings and GPS transmitters (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, 2018b). Blood samples have been taken to perform genetic analyses and stable isotope analysis to better understand the species's diet.<br/>'Colony  Guardians' have been established with local communities  (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2016a). These  are local people assigned to protect nests from predators, and to  collect breeding data. Their efforts have improved survival rates at a  number of colonies; recruitment is significantly enhanced at nests with Colony Guardians  (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2016a). An awareness-raising program has included displays and theatre productions within the region and the production of a video highlighting the plight of the species, which has been presented to over 100,000 people. An interpretation centre has been established at RÃ­o Gallegos, an important wintering area for the species (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Workshops have been held in 2014 and 2016 to provide updates on conservation work and engage with the scientific community (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b). Members of the Hooded Grebe Project have met with fishing, environmental and conservation agencies in Santa Cruz to inform them of key sites for the species to support decision-making (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). In August 2015, a 'Hooded grebe month' took place, involving&#160;educational, recreational, cultural and artistic activities (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b). Teachers have been trained about the species's biology and threats (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b).<br/><br/>A monitoring protocol and control program for invasive species has been devised, targeting American Mink, Kelp Gulls (Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2013) and salmonid populations at breeding lakes and identifying routes of arrival. Work is ongoing to eradicate American Mink from the high plateau areas (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>, </em>2016b). In 2014/2015, 40% fewer mink were captured compared to 2013/2014 indicating that these control measures were proving to be effective. A regulation has been passed banning the introduction of trout on the Buenos Aires plateau and a large number of trout have been removed from Laguna El Islote (CasaÃ±as&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a). In 2015, Kelp Gull were controlled on the Buenos Aires plateau by shaking eggs to reduce breeding success (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;<br/><br/>&#160;A captive rearing programme has been initiated near the Strobel Lake population, with the aim of raising wild eggs in captivity and releasing them back to Strobel Lake in order to boost the population (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015), although by 2018 no captive-reared chicks had so far been released (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2018a).<br/><br/>Experiments to prevent the loss of colonies to wave action during exceptionally strong winds have been undertaken, but were halted due to the risk posed to the grebes (CasaÃ±as <em>et al.</em> 2013, Roesler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018a).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Continue comprehensive surveys of breeding colonies and winter censuses of estuaries and unfrozen lakes.

Study the species's ecology to understand population movements. Continue to investigate the threats to the species and the reasons behind recent declines. Investigate the threats to Hooded Grebes on the wintering grounds, particularly their interaction with fisheries (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Ensure that management activities for the species are implemented in Patagonia National Park, and more land is acquired (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015).

It has not been recorded from Tristan de Cunha for 35 years, and, were it to be confirmed as locally extinct there, it may qualify for uplisting to Critically Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","This species feeds mainly on squid with some fish and crustaceans (<strong></strong>Klages and Cooper 1997)<strong></strong>. It nests in burrows dug in peaty soils in fern-bush vegetation from 50-300 m on Gough Island and, formerly, at higher elevations of up to 700 m on Tristan da Cunha. Nothing is known of age of first breeding, breeding frequency or survival (P. G.  Ryan <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Heavily affected by Hurricane Catarina in March 2004, 354 birds were recorded blown inland, all in heavy moult and near starvation (Bugoni <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Larger numbers of females among these were thought to be due to difference in at-sea distribution or in body condition (Bugoni<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2007). Evidence suggests moult is completed during the exodus period and before egg-laying, which occurs from 15 June to 21 July (Cuthbert 2004).<p></p>","<p>This species is primarily threatened by a reduction in reproductive success due to depredation of nests by invasive House Mice. On Gough Island, where 90% of the global population is found, chick failure was 87% in 2014-15, with chicks attacked by mice within 2 hours of hatching and dead within 3-7 hours (Dilley <em>et al</em>. 2015). On Tristan da Cunha, rats and mice are present and have likely contributed to the extirpation of the Atlantic Petrel from the island (Richardson 1984, Wanless <em>et al.</em> 2012), with human exploitation representing another potential driver of decline on this island (Richardson 1984). It is very unlikely to be exploited today (P. G. Ryan <em>in litt</em>. 1999, A. Bond <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The large population of native Southern Skua <em>Stercorarius antarcticus</em> feed on seabirds, including <em>P. incerta</em> (Richardson 1984); however, this is unlikely to be significant except in the situation that the population becomes greatly depleted.</p>  Significant mortality of moulting adults, largely females, due to Hurricane Catarina indicates that increased storm intensity and frequency is likely to cause unpredictable adult mortality. Night strikes, as a result of being attracted to lights, are a further threat. This has been ameliorated at the Gough Island meteorological station, but may still pose a problem on ships at sea (Glass and Ryan 2013). It is, however, not thought to be causing significant declines in the population.<p></p>","<p>On Gough Island, Cuthbert (2004) estimated 1.8 million breeding pairs in 2001, suggesting a world population of around 5 million birds. The population size was re-estimated by Rexer-Huber <em>et al. </em>(2014), taking into account the occupancy rates of suitable burrows in 2010 and 2012. This new estimate indicates a population size of 860,000 pairs, varying between 630,000 and 1,100,000 pairs. Because occupancy rates varied interannually, the speciesâs total breeding area could only be estimated crudely, and burrow densities were assumed to be similar throughout the habitat. This estimate should, therefore, be treated with caution.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pterodroma incerta</em> breeds only on Gough Island, Tristan da Cunha (<strong>St Helena to UK</strong>). It is absent from Nightingale Island where there is no suitable habitat, and probably also from Inaccessible Island, although it is possible that a small number of birds could breed there (P. G. Ryan <em>in litt.</em> 1999). The species's occurrence on Tristan da Cunha is unclear; in 1972-1974 the population there was estimated to be 100-200 pairs, and there may only be a few scattered pairs remaining.&#160;On Gough Island, the first quantitative population estimate indicates a total of around 1.8 million pairs (Cuthbert 2004), which is considerably larger than the earlier estimate of at least 20,000 pairs (P. G. Ryan <em>in litt.</em> 1999). However, a recent estimate taking into account the occupancy rates of burrows which are suitable for the species halves this number and suggests a population size of 860,000 pairs, varying between 630,000 and 1,100,000 pairs (Rexer-Huber <em>et al.</em> 2014), and several studies revealed very low breeding success of less than 20% (Cuthbert and Hilton 2004, Wanless <em>et al.</em> 2007, Dilley <em>et al. </em>2015). At sea, it is practically restricted to the South Atlantic, occurring off the east coast of South America to the west coast of Africa (Enticott 1991, P. G.

It qualifies as Endangered because breeding is now restricted to just two colonies, which remain vulnerable to feral pigs that occur in adjoining areas of the Kaikoura Mountains.&#160;<p></p> <p></p>","The species digs its burrows on gentle to steep mountain slopes at 1,200-1,800 m, under tussock grass or low alpine scrubland (Marchant and Higgins 1990)<strong></strong>. First breeding is thought to occur at 4-6 years of age. The species feeds mostly on small fish and krill (Heather and Robertson 1997)<strong></strong>. Birds gather food for chicks as far south as the Otago Peninsula and often fish around Banks Peninsula bays (Harrow 2009). Kapiti Island and Cook Strait are common feeding areas in the north, with foraging individuals also recorded near the Chatham Islands (Harrow 2009). Frequently diving to feed at c.25 m, they have been recorded as deep as 36.6 m (Harrow 2009). Levels of burrow occupancy in both original colonies in 2006/2007 was found to be similar to the 1990s. In contrast, breeding success in both main colonies was thought to be due to poor at-sea feeding conditions, rather than increases in stoat predation, as no evidence pointed to the latter (Sommer<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009). Annual adult survival, breeding success and burrow occupancy averaged 93%, 47% and 71%, respectively (Sommer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Low levels of breeding success, particularly at Shearwater Stream colony, point to the possibility of the colony levels being maintained by immigration from the more successful Kowhai Valley colony (Sommer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<p></p>","<p>Introduced stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> are known to prey on burrowing seabirds (Moors and Atkinson 1984, Lyver 2002), and their continued presence in both remaining colonies is of major concern for the future survival of the species (Sherley 1992). Initially, stoats were thought to be the primary cause of the speciesâs decline (Sherley 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997); however, longer-term research has shown that only a small proportion of adults are taken, and the impact on breeding success could be insignificant (Cuthbert 1999, Cuthbert and Davis 2002). Predation and disturbance by feral pigs and cats are considered a major potential threat, but are normally absent from the breeding range (Cuthbert 1999, Taylor 2000, Cuthbert 2002). Habitat destruction and predation by feral pigs <em>Sus domesticus</em>, along with heavy browsing by a range of introduced herbivores may have been the cause of the complete destruction of some sub-colonies, contributing considerably to habitat loss and range contraction (Sommer <em>et al.</em> 2009). At least one feral cat <em>Felis catus</em> was present in the Kowhai valley colony in the 1998/99 season (Cuthbert 2003), but cats were otherwise absent from the colony, hence only occasionally do cats appear to contribute to species mortality. </p>  <p>Incidental capture in set-nets and inshore long-liners is also reported, with up to 80 individuals being caught in a single net (West and Imber 1985, Darby and Dawson 2000, Harrow 2009). In addition, long-term over-harvesting of some inshore fish species could compromise prey availability to Huttonâs Shearwaters with potentially severe impacts (Taylor 2000). Modelling has demonstrated that colonies are most vulnerable to the loss of breeding adults; therefore, maintaining high survivorship is paramount (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2001).</p><p>Juveniles are subject to grounding due to light pollution; however, the proportion of birds affected remained on average below 1% per year, and 80% of the juveniles grounded could be rescued and released afterwards (Deppe <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/></p>  Climate change poses a potential threat to the species, due to its geographically bounded distribution; its altitudinal distribution falls entirely within 2,000 m of the highest mountain top within its range (2,885 m) (BirdLife International <em>unpubl. data</em>). Breeding at high altitude also makes the species susceptible to detrimental effects of abnormal amounts or timing of snowfall; heavy snowfall can crush burrows, and late snow cover can delay or prevent breeding (Taylor 2000).<p></p>","Cuthbert and Davis (2002) estimated 106,000 breeding pairs. Brooke (2004) estimated a total population of 300,000-350,000 individuals.",Stable,"<em>Puffinus huttoni</em> breeds in the Seaward Kaikoura Range, north-east South Island, <strong>New Zealand</strong>. The population comprises two main colonies (Kowhai Valley and Shearwater Stream), sited 10-18 km inland. These were estimated to consist of 106,000 pairs at Kowhai and 8,000 pairs at Shearwater Stream (Sommer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009). The  total population is estimated to number 300,000-350,000 individuals (Brooke 2004)<strong></strong>. Numbers and distribution within the Kaikoura Ranges have decreased, with 8 of 10 known colonies having been extirpated this century (Cuthbert 1999)<strong></strong>. Six out of eight colonies discovered in the high Kaikoura Mountains were likely extirpated by feral pigs, which remain a potential threat to the remaining two colonies (Harrow 2009).&#160;Since the rapid extirpation of colonies was detected, a third population on the Kaikoura peninsula has been established through translocation of chicks (Anon 2007, Ombler 2010).

Long-term projects to monitor threats and to study population dynamics are ongoing (Taylor 2000)<strong></strong>. Pigs are controlled on the colony boundaries (Cuthbert 1999)<strong></strong>. A third population is being established on the Kaikoura Peninsula: 10 fledglings were transferred there in 2005, 80 in 2006, c.100 in 2007 and 100 in 2008 (Anon 2007, Ombler 2010), and a further 200 in 2012 and 2013. 30 birds from the early translocations are producing 6 to 8 fledglings per year and the first of these are now returning to the colony. Over 60 birds were present in 2015/2016, including 3 returned chicks and 28 of the fledglings translocated in 2012 and 2013, which will potentially be part of the breeding population in 2017 and after (Rowe <em>unpubl. data</em>, Rowe 2016a,b).

Therefore, it is listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","The species breeds in steep and extremely rugged terrain at 160-1,200 m. It usually nests in burrows associated with the root structure of trees, including Ohia lehua (<em>Metrosideros polymorpha</em>) and a dominant understory of densely matted uluhe fern (<em>Dicranopteris linearis</em>) in montane mesic forests on steep slopes (<strong></strong>Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007). In general, it can nest in any habitat that is free of predators (Troy <em>et al. </em>2016, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>The breeding season begins in April, when birds return to prospect for nest sites and, following an exodus in late April, egg-laying in early June is highly synchronised (NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Pairs produce one egg, which is incubated for an average of 53-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 81-94 days (NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Most young fledge by November (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The age at first breeding is around six or seven years (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The species's diet is not well known, although it likely consists of fish and squid,&#160;particularly flyingfish and Purpleback Flying Squid (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ainley <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong></strong>. It forages for hundreds of kilometres offshore, often in large, mixed species flocks associated with schools of large, predatory fish that drive prey species to the ocean surface (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>","<p>The main threat to this species is thought to be predation by non-native species (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 1999, Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005, NSWG 2005). Predation of adults and juveniles by feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> and Barn Owls <em>Tyto alba</em> has been documented on almost every colony on Kaua'i, including the most remote sites (NSWG 2005, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans</em>, Black Rats <em>R. rattus</em>, Brown Rats <em>R. rattus</em> and House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> were inadvertently introduced to the Hawaiian islands as a result of human activity and shipwrecks (Duffy 2010) and may depredate eggs and chicks (NSWG 2005). Brown Rats appear to be more associated with human settlement and do not appear to be as severe a threat as the other two introduced rat species (Raine <em>et al</em>. 2017). Another potential predator, the Small Indian Mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, has recently been discovered on Kaua'i (NSWG 2005), and could potentially be a greater threat than cats as its smaller size means it may be able to enter breeding burrows more easily (Duffy and Capece 2014). It is yet to establish a permanent presence on the island (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2016), although it has a history of incursions onto Kaua'i and one was trapped there in 2016 (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt</em>. 2016). When the Two-spotted Leafhopper <em>Sophonia rufofascia</em> first established on the Hawaiian Islands, it led to habitat loss through feeding on the Uluhe Fern D<em>icranopteris linearis</em> which provide cover for shearwater burrows (Cooper and Day 1998). The leafhopper was a cause for great concern not only for shearwaters, but also for agricultural crops and native flora; hence a biological control programme was initiated and the insect is now hard to find on Hawai'i (Coll and Wajnberg 2017). Dogs have been shot at Ka'ena Point, while attacking nestling albatrosses and shearwaters (Duffy 2010), but the scale of their impact is unknown. Habitat loss due to conversion and introduction of herbivores like domesticated goats and pigs pose another threat on the Hawaiian Islands (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2012), and have been suggested as a contributing factor for the recent abandonment of some colonies (Troy and Holmes 2008, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>On Kaua'i, hurricanes Iwa and Iniki devastated the forests in 1982 and 1992, dramatically reducing available nesting habitat and reducing breeding attempts for Newellâs Shearwaters (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Given that a large proportion of the population breeds on Kaua'i, catastrophic events, like hurricanes, represent a serious threat (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>During the 1980s and 1990s an estimated 70 adults and 280 subadults each summer, and at least 340 fledglings each autumn, died as a result of collisions with power-lines and communications towers, or indirectly because of light attraction (Podolsky <em>et al.</em> 1998, Anon. 2007). In the surveyed areas on eastern and southern Kaua'i, 350 adults are reported dead each year from collisions with power lines (Podolsky <em>et al.</em> 1998). Fledglings on their first flight to the ocean are particularly susceptible to attraction to artificial light. The birds are attracted and disoriented by coastal street lights and once grounded, unable to fly and often killed by cars, cats or dogs, or die from starvation or dehydration (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005). Between 1978 and 1981, more than 5,000 individuals were grounded on Kaua'i, and more than 30,000 have been found as victims of fallout since 1971 (Anon. 2007, Griesemer and Holmes 2011). Intense rescue programmes have been initiated to find grounded birds and return them to the sea (Everett and Pitman 1993). On Kaua'i, approximately 1,500 fledglings are recovered annually after becoming grounded (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005), although with the suspected steep population decline on Kaua'i, the number of grounded birds is expected to have decreased proportionately (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Collision with artificial structures (such as powerlines and wind turbines) is another key threat to the species, particularly in flight corridors for subadult and adult birds accessing inland colonies. Nine communications towers have recently been constructed on the Hawaiian Islands without proper consultation, and these are now the subject of an ongoing lawsuit (Anon. 2007). A field of wind generators was planned for Kaua'i and Lana'i (Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 2009 <em>in</em> Duffy 2010), without accounting for the potential impacts on this species. Although wind farms have been shown to have only minor effects on other bird species elsewhere, night-flying Shearwaters may be particularly vulnerable and the cumulative effects of construction and maintenance, erosion, vegetation clearing and noise should be accounted for (Duffy 2010). It is not confirmed whether the wind farm projects will be realised (T. Holmes <em>in litt</em>. 2007, A. Raine <em>in litt.</em> 2016).</p>  <p>Plastic pollution poses yet another threat. On Kaua'i, 50% of Newellâs Shearwater fledglings necropsied during 2007â2014 contained plastic items in their digestive tract and there is evidence that the mass and the number of items ingested per bird have also increased since the 1980s (Kain <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is thought that consumption of even small quantities of plastic, including fibres and small fragments, exposes birds at all stages of the breeding cycle to plastic-associated co-pollutants and associated impacts survival (Kain <em>et a</em>l. 2016).</p>  On Hawai'i, cinder mining has resulted in habitat loss at several colonies (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1983 <em>in</em> Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997, Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005) and together with other causes of habitat degradation (invasive vegetation, agriculture and urbanisation) contributes to the exposure and increased predation of ground-nesting birds (Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997). The species is also likely to be impacted by the commercial fishery through bycatch and indirect ecosystem effects resulting from overfishing of tuna <em>Tunnus</em> spp. (Mitchell <em>et al. </em>2005, Waugh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<p></p>","There have been several population size estimates for this species (see  Griesemer and Holmes 2011), but the most recent gives a minimum  population estimate of 27,011 individuals (Joyce 2016), which roughly equates to 18,000 mature individuals. However, given the decline on Kauai and near extirpation from Maui, the population size could now be far smaller (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016). The population size is therefore precautionarily placed in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Puffinus newelli</em> nests principally on the mountains of Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>). Small colonies exist on Moloka'i, Hawai`i and possibly Maui, with unconfirmed records from Lana`i. After not having been recorded on Oahu since the 1700s, a survey carried out in 2016-2017 located the species in two sites at Mount Kaala and at Poamoho, suggesting that it regularly visits or even breeds on the island (Young <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In the late 1970s, a cross-fostering experiment was carried out at Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge (Kaua'i), in which 90 eggs were placed in nests of the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (<em>A</em><em>rdenna pacifica</em>) (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. Subsequently, 30 young were fledged. Four breeding pairs nesting in 2006 were believed to be descendents of fostered birds (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. Between 2006 and 2013, colony calls were played at the Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge and artificial burrows constructed to attract nesting pairs, as there is a low threat from alien predators or collisions with artificial structures (Anon. 2007). Subsequently, up to 13 pairs have been recorded there (N. Holmes and A. Raine&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. After the construction of a predator-proof fence in 2015 within the Refuge, 8 chicks were translocated to the site from montane colonies and were raised to fledging (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is planned to translocate up to 50 chicks to the Refuge over a five year period (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Also since 2015, social attraction has also been employed in an attempt to save the population on Maui. While the results are looking favourable, it is too soon to evaluate success (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>In total, predator control and monitoring activities are in place at six colonies on Kaua'i, which involve the control of cats, rats, pigs and Barn Owls as well as monitoring the effectiveness of these activities through the use of cameras and acoustic monitoring devices (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). On Kauai', Barn Owl control is also carried out at another five colonies located along the Na Pali coast, Kalaheo/Kahili and Hanalei valley (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). The effectiveness of Barn Owl control is being monitored through the deployment of acoustic recording devices via helicopter in management areas (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>There is an active programme to control lights across Kaua'i. Building's lighting has been effectively re-designed to reduce collisions (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006 under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has enforced a campaign, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua`i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. In the course of the campaign, also street lights are darkened or turned off by the island's electricity company.&#160;<br/><br/>Moreover, the electricity company of Kaua'i has started incorporating a range of  measures to reduce powerline collisions, including moving lines  underground, lowering them, fitting diverters and testing a âlaser  fenceâ on key lines to make them more visible to birds moving at night  (Griesmer and Holmes 2011, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Several lawsuits have already been brought forward for violations under the Endangered Species Act (Harrison 2009), including against a hotel which was responsible for over one quarter of all birds downed as a result of light pollution. However, there is still a considerable amount of infrastructure that needs to be modified. It is not expected that the threat posed by artificial lighting will ever be completely eliminated (N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Yet overall, significant improvements have been made to reduce light attraction and collision (N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>.  Over 30,000 downed birds have been rescued and released through the  Save Our Shearwaters programme since 1979 (Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017),  although few of  these birds have subsequently been found again (NSWG 2005, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016). <p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Enforce regulatory compliance to minimize light attraction (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Continue predator control in remaining populations in north-west Kaua'i (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Establish predator-free colonies through fencing, trapping of predators, and use social attraction to entice shearwaters to nest within (Griesemer and Holmes 2011, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016). Continue to use radar observations to monitor population trends and develop methods to monitor breeding success (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Conduct long-term demographic studies to measure the success of habitat and predator management (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Continue to retrieve grounded birds (N.

152845178,60344,Anguilla anguilla,Critically Endangered,A2bd+4bd,2020,2018-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> exhibits facultative catadromy (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000, Tesch 2003), has multiple life stages, and is semelparous (Tesch 2003) and is panmictic across a continental spatial scale (Als <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pujolar <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>b</em>); these life history traits and characteristics made application of the IUCN Red List criteria challenging. Anguillids are often referred to as âfreshwater eelsâ, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk31280999"">The IUCN Red List criteria prioritise indices of mature animals at their breeding area. I</a>n the absence of such data for the eel, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of European Eels, leaving âcontinentalâ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of (pre-) spawning stock biomass, but such data sets for migrating silver eel are low in number, spatially limited and only recent (most only since 2010). The index data best representing the geographic range of <em>A. anguilla</em><em>, </em>over adequate time scales to apply the Red List criteria<em>,</em><em> </em>relate to glass eels, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood (Westerberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). While there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock (e.g. Dekker, 2004, Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011), evidence is lacking to support such hypotheses and to deviate from the common view that the European Eel is a panmictic species, i.e. all individuals come from a single spawning stock. As such, escapement from a specific river/country/region will not be directly reflected in subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. Furthermore, it is most precautionary to assume that each and every part of the continental distribution area potentially contributes to the reproductive process, or that each part may be the key part (Dekker 1999). Therefore, the IUCN Red List criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the most comprehensive estimate.</p><p>Yellow and silver eel data for <em>A. anguilla </em>have an uneven geographical spread and do not fully represent the stock across its range. Nevertheless, a cursory analysis of these data found that over three generation lengths (39 years; see Habitat and Ecology), the mean decline in yellow and silver eels was found to be greater than 50% (see Population). Both analyses on yellow and silver eels indicated declines within the range of Endangered (EN) category. <a name=""_Hlk26366036""></a></p><p>Compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, are strong correlations between recruit series from sites over the range showing substantial declines during the period of the last three generations (Bornarel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The ICES recruitment index is 98.6% lower in the âNorth Seaâ series, and 94% lower in the âElsewhereâ series, compared to the 1960â1979 reference level (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). It is noted, however, that the most recent statistical analyses conducted on these recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011â2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, the numbers of silver eels may continue to decline, reflecting past declines in recruitment. </p><p>Sampling for leptocephali in the Sargasso Sea was undertaken in 2011, and results compared with previous sampling across the same area occurring in 1983 and 1985 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). The reduction in catch rate was 89% between 1983 and 2011, and 64% between 1985 and 2011 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation indicates a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding grounds over this time period, suggesting a lower abundance of spawners, higher egg and/or larval mortality and/or a reduction in spawning success. Thus, data on leptocephali and recruits to continental waters indicate declines within the range of Critically Endangered (CR). </p><p>A suite of threats have been implicated in the decline of European Eel recruitment and stock: barriers to migration â including damage by hydropower turbines and pumps; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly&#160;<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>); exploitation of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation.&#160;The significance of these threats individually or synergistically may vary across spatial range of the eel. Further research is required to fully quantify and understand the complexities of individual and combined threats.</p><p>Eel Management Plans (EMPs) have been developed in European Union Member States after implementation of the EU Council Regulation No 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the European Eel (EU 2007). The Regulation set the objective of each EMP to be to âreduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stockâ (EU 2007), and that EMPs would be prepared with the purpose of achieving this objective in the long term. </p><p>A number of management measures are being implemented in line with EMPs,&#160;including control of fisheries, bypassing turbines and pumps, easing of barriers and restocking - transfer of eel from one watershed to another. Quantifying the effects of these measures on silver eel escapement biomass is complicated in many cases because (i) measures are not implemented in isolation, making it difficult to identify individual contributions, and (ii) measures affecting earlier life stages will take years to influence silver eels, and ultimately spawning stock. There remains a great deal of debate as to whether restocking benefits the eel spawning stock and thus enhances future recruitment. Regulations and management actions currently focus on increasing escapement from continental waters, although these do not take account of eel condition or quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). &#160;&#160;</p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). It was concluded that the Regulation has been important in catalysing activity towards the recovery of the European Eel and remains a relevant document (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). However, despite progress, the eel remains in a critical condition and recovery could take decades, and further ambition is required (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>).</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16â17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2007,&#160;&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;was listed in Appendix II of CITES (the&#160;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#160;of Wild Fauna and Flora)&#160;due to concerns over the impact of international trade on this species (this listing came into force in March 2009).&#160;In 2010, the EUâs Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded it was not possible to perform a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF) for this species (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). Exports out of, and imports into, the European Union (EU), have since ceased due to ongoing concerns over the decline in recruitment and stocks. However, trade continues within the EU and from non-EU countries within its range to other non-EU countries. In 2014, <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> was also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).</p><p>The limited understanding of the complex relationship between recruitment, growth phase, and escapement makes it difficult to determine how declines in one will affect the other. However, it has been concluded that low recruitment will very likely ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at least one generation length (13 years; see Habitat and Ecology). Further, since there is a short time period (~two years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low breeding stock. As such it was deemed appropriate to assign&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;a Critically Endangered (CR) listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (A2bd+4bd).</p><p>This category status remains unchanged from the previous assessment. Ultimately the CR category accounts for a proportional decline in population over a continental scale and this species has undergone a substantial decline over the last three generations. Although implementation of management measures has shown improvement, there is still concern over the effectiveness of EMPs to generate recovery to historic reference state within an appropriate timeframe, in the context of multiple threats (European Commission 2020). Continued, and ideally increased, effort will be essential in promoting recovery. A drive to fill data gaps â particularly in relation to the southern range of this species â would allow a more spatially comprehensive assessment in the future. </p><p>                          </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>â9<sup>th</sup> November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eelâs life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters (ICES 2015). It also occupies open ocean areas during migrations but is rarely observed in this habitat. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea; it is stocked elsewhere.<br/> <br/> <strong>Ecology:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is facultatively catadromous, living in fresh, brackish and coastal waters but migrating to pelagic marine waters to breed (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000). While there is some understanding of the eelâs continental life history, relatively little is known about its marine phase. The migrations in the European Eelâs life cycle are the longest and most oceanographically complex of the Anguillid species (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2002). </p><p>There are no exact data about specific spawning sites, however, it is hypothesised that spawning takes place in an elliptic zone, about 2,000 km wide in the Sargasso Sea, in the West Central Atlantic (from 70Â° W and eastward to 50Â° W) (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2019). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). The adults are assumed to die after spawning (Tesch 2003). Oceanic migration of leptocephali is estimated to take about two years on average before they arrive at the continental shelf (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The mechanisms by which leptocephali reach the European and N. African coasts are not well understood. In the Atlantic region, recruitment has been found to follow a South to North gradient over a period of around four to five months (ICES 2020). This starts in September in the North-West and occurs progressively later in the Channel and North Sea (ICES 2020). Recruitment to the Mediterranean is slightly more complex, publications suggest most eel ascent occurs between December and March, and landings suggest a peak in January. Although in some areas, recruitment occur over a wider period, even year-round (ICES 2020). <br/> <br/> Glass eels enter freshwater as sexually undifferentiated individuals. Development and differentiation of the sexual organs are thought to be closely correlated with body size and associated with the yellowing phase of the life history. Sex determination is principally driven by environmental factors with density-dependence producing more males at high densities (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Male European eels initially grow faster than females, however, females achieve a greater age and size than males when sexually mature. Furthermore, the mean length increases significantly with latitude in females but not males, whereas age increases significantly in both (Durif <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Aprahamian unpub. data). Male fitness is maximised by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time minimising strategy) such that males tend to emigrate at a length of &lt;450 mm (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Conversely, females adopt a more flexible size-maximising strategy prior to migration that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity (Davey and Jellyman 2005). There is considerable geographic variation in mean length at metamorphosis of male and female European eels (VÃ¸llestad 1992). Dekker <em>et al</em>. (1998) described the extreme sizes in each of the life stages of the European eel from data at a long-term capture locality in the Netherlands, this paper also discussed the international situation, finding no more extreme values (sizes (cm): MinâMax, glass eels: 5.4â9.2, yellow: 6.9â133.0, silver (Male): 21.2â44.4, Silver (Female): 26.4â101.0). Driven by density-dependence, there are often skewed sex ratios at individual localities as well as geographic bias associated with latitude.<br/> <br/> Eel growth increases with temperature, as documented in aquaculture (Sadler 1979, Dosoretz and Degani 1987, Holmgren 1996, Ciccotti and Fontenelle 2001), and growth rate is generally faster in saline water than fresh (Acou <em>et al</em>. 2003, Daverat and Tomas 2006, Cairns <em>et al</em>. 2009). Furthermore, those individuals produced in saline waters usually have significantly higher fat content and contain lower loads of the swim bladder parasite, <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> and thus may have improved chances of reaching their spawning grounds (ICES 2009, Marohn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Body burden of toxic compounds, that are thought to affect migration and reproductive success, are also variable over regions and river basins, dependent on local pollution pressure (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the growth phase, dependent on size, eels feed on a variety of organisms including fish, amphipods and decapod crustaceans. In saline muddy-bottomed habitats, eels forage on bivalves, shrimp, small fish and polychaete worms. The tendency towards piscivory has been linked to eel length: there is evidence that eels &gt;40 cm have the ability to consume larger prey such as fish or crustaceans (Moriarty 1974, Mann and Blackburn 1991, YalÃ§Ä±n-Ãzdilek and Solak 2007). Lammens <em>et al</em>. (1985) observed periods of low chironomid biomass to be a factor resulting in eels switching to prey on fish. In a comparison of two lakes in Germany, piscivory in eels was also concluded to be controlled by macrozoobenthos density (DÃ¶rner <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>      </p><p>The age at which eels undergo the transformation to the silver stage and undertake their spawning migration, is hugely variable and dependent on latitude and temperature of the environment in which they have grown, food availability, physical barriers that block migration routes, growth rate and sex differences. Estimates for average ranges of the continental growth phase were suggested as approximately 2â15 years for males and 4â20 years for females (Tesch 2003) â noting that much older individual eels occur especially in the latter. Durif <em>et al</em> (2009) examined a number of data sets from across the species range in relation to age at silvering which indicated a range of 2 to 15 years for males and 2 to 30 years for females. From these ranges, an estimated generation length of 13 years was used for this assessment, inclusive of a two-year larval migration and one-year spawning migration of silver eels (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has however been stated that there is variability in the accuracy of the methods used to age eels (ICES 2015). Assessment of available data on generation length during the IUCN Red List process highlighted that defining the required single generation length value for species with a broad range of ages-at-maturation such as eels was extremely difficult. Factors that can significantly affect this parameter include longitude and latitude, sex, growth rates, habitat quality and resource availability.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is susceptible to a number of natural and anthropogenic threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat loss/degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). The occurrence and significance of these threats varies considerably from area to area across the species range. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Dekker 2004, Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures (listed below), are less likely to have a significant positive effect on the stock than a combined approach. </p><p>There is a significant body of information including a great deal of contradiction in peer-reviewed and grey literature, and in expert opinion, relating to these threats. The assessment process and accompanying external review indicated that a comprehensive discussion of these threats and their impacts was significantly beyond the scope of this assessment. Below, all suspected threats are listed (in alphabetical order), with some (but not all) key references and a very brief synopsis of these threats.

In the AMBER (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers) project has begun tracking barriers across Europe, compiling them into a âBarrier Atlasâ to better inform management and conservation (AMBER International 2019). The project is ongoing, but so far around 415,000 barriers - complete or partial, with degree of obstruction not often fully quantified - have been recorded within this tool (AMBER International 2019). Relating in particular to hydropower, 21,387 plants are recorded currently in existence in Europe, with a further 278 under construction, and 8,507 planned (Schwarz <em>et al</em>. 2019).<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> In the Iberian Peninsula, 80% of eel habitat had been lost when compared to a 19<sup>th</sup> century baseline, as a result of dams causing fragmentation (Clavero and Hermoso 2015). A full life cycle model developed by Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggested the decline of the European Eel between 1975 and 1985 may be somewhat attributed to habitat loss. The model projected a reduction in suitable eel habitat, by 16% in the Mediterranean and 71% in the North and Baltic seas (Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. 2015). Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial use (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). For example, Portugal, Spain and Morocco have been impacted by dam construction and/or drought in recent decades (Kettle <em>et al.</em> 2011). Further, it has been hypothesised, that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this speciesâ, particularly the femaleâs, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success (van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000).</p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in <em>A. anguilla</em> â particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding area (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p><p>The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American Eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif <em>et al</em>. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to larval metamorphosis being impeded due to the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Miller and Tsukamoto 2016). <a name=""_Hlk13652216"">Using a high-resolution ocean model, Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. (2014) found ocean current variations to be a major driver in the onset of decline in European Eel recruitment that occurred in the early 1980s. Although after this period, the correlation between oceanic fluctuations and eel recruitment was lost, and lack of recovery was likely a result of other pressures (Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. 2014). </a>Pacariz <em>et al</em>. (2014), however, found that the overall success of larval drift from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958â2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson <em>et al</em>. (2012). Politis <em>et al</em>. (2017) found 18Â°C to be optimum temperature for spawning of <em>A. anguilla</em> under experimental conditions. The results suggested <em>A. anguilla</em> may inhabit a deeper layer of the Sargasso Sea during early life stages and may be vulnerable to changes in temperature as a result of ocean warming. A recent ICES WGEEL report described climate change and increasing ocean temperature under ânew and emerging threatsâ, due to unusually warm and dry periods occurring throughout European countries (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). This warm and dry period resulted in higher water temperatures, reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, and in some cases habitat loss through drought, creating stressful conditions for eels and other freshwater biota (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). There were several reports of eel mortalities from European countries, connected to warmer water, increased instances of disease, or deaths that could not be explained (ICES2018<em>c</em>).</p><p>The parasite nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>), introduced when the Japanese Eel (<em>A. japonica</em>) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach its spawning ground. There multiple proposed impacts which include a negative effect on silver stage physiology (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012); swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007); and a reduced ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, SjÃ¶berg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Prevalence of <em>A. crassus</em> has been found to be higher in smaller eels (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017, Hafir-Mansouri <em>et al</em>. 2018), with the proposal that smaller eels feeding mainly on invertebrates have a greater infection intensity than larger, piscivorous eels, because of increased chance of encounter with infected invertebrate hosts (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p><p>Lipophilic pollutant contaminants and metals act as stressors within the continental stage of the European Eel life cycle (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). This can result in damage to the respiratory system, tissues and organs, alter the regular function of endocrine processes, osmoregulation, and haematological dynamics, as well as decreasing protein content, reducing the ability of an eel to cope with physiological stress (Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019, De Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Lipids are essential for allowing normal migration and reproduction (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). As pollutants impair lipid metabolism and storage, it may reduce the ability of silver eels to migration (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). Chemicals stored by eels and released when fat stores are broken down during migration, could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al</em>.&#160; 2019). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low-quality gametes, as well as transmission of pollutants to the larvae (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, SÃ¼hring <em>et al</em>. 2015, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016;,Freese<em> et al.</em> 2017, 2019, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Nowosad <em>et al</em>. 2018). Ultimately, pollutants may be affecting eels at molecular and individual levels, but also scaling to population and community wide effects (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019). Lipophilic chemical pollutants have been identified as a cause of recruitment failure, although current policies focusing on increasing escapement from continental waters do not consider eel quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). To mitigate impacts of contaminants, it may be valuable for management to integrate methods to improve the condition and quality of both habitats and escaping eels (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). This may also be considered in relation to stocking activities, by ensuring eels have suitable, unpolluted rearing habitat (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Predation also represents a threat to <em>A. anguilla</em> and is increasingly being discussed in relation to competition with commercial and recreational fisheries. Cormorants in particular have been a focus of recent research, which has found eel consumption by cormorants to be of a similar quantity to that of fishery landings in both the Baltic Sea (Hansson <em>et al</em>. 2018) and some lakes in Sweden (OvegÃ¥rd 2017). Human factors may exacerbate the threat. Under experimental conditions, acoustic disturbance has been found to reduce anti-predation behaviour in eels, affecting likelihood of survival (Simpson <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>Unsustainable exploitation is a threat to the species. Fishing for the European Eel began with small scale fisheries up to the late 1800s, before shifting during the mid-1900s to larger scale, commercial exploitation, with production peaking between 1960â70 (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016, Dekker 2019, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Across its distribution, all continental stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and period of collection. Trade of European Eel continues within the European Union (EU) for consumption, culture and stocking, although export from the EU has been banned since 2010 although over this time period commercial landings of yellow and silver eels have remained relatively consistent (around 2000â3000 tonnes) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>) (see Conservation). Indeed, it seems that yellow/silver eels are declining while glass eel catches increase (European Commission 2020<em>a</em>).</p><p>                          </p><p>Despite the ban on trade outside of the EU, under-reporting, illegal fishing (poaching) and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European Eel fisheries (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is little information regarding illegal exploitation of the European Eel, which is thought to be driven mainly by demand from East Asia for use as a substitute for <em>Anguilla japonica</em>, due to the reduced abundance of glass eels of this species (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Assessment of the impact of this component of fishery exploitation is therefore extremely difficult. Export of European Eel outside of EU borders is visible through trade statistics, and enforcement agencies report the tonnage of successful operations where shipments have been intercepted, and seizures made (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). A review of exploitation, including an attempt to understand the scale of eel trafficking for the European Eel was conducted by Stein and Dekker in Kaifu <em>et al</em>. (2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Determining changes in the stock of European Eel is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, eels in continental waters, and escapement. Not only can there be a large time lag (10's of years) between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed, for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the population dynamics of the oceanic phase of <em>A. anguilla</em> (ICES 2013<em>a</em>). </p><p>Assessment of datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account the following: consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether data were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.</p><p>There are more available datasets for <em>A. anguilla</em> in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa. For the purposes of analysing recruitment trends, ICES often refers to the North Sea subpopulation in separate terms to the rest of Europe. This is because the rate of decline in abundance of <em>A. anguilla </em>recruitmen<em>t </em>has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to elsewhere (ICES 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985. Declines in both the North Sea and elsewhere indices are presented and considered. Unless otherwise stated, data were accessed through relevant contacts in the EIFAAC/ICES/GFCM Working Group on Eels (WGEEL).<br/> <br/> </p><p><strong>Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Glass eel and young-of-year recruitment data used to inform this assessment were taken from the analysis provided in ICES (2019<em>a</em>). Data used in the ICES recruitment index were from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium in the âNorth Seaâ series, and UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy in the âElsewhereâ series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment is based largely on data from the Baltic area where only yellow stage eels are recruited (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). <br/> <br/> Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent-wide decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. The ICES recruitment index fell to its lowest historical level in 2012: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960â1979 (ICES 2012). In the most recent ICES report, the provisional 2019 recruitment index was at 1.4% of the 1960â1979 reference level in the âNorth Seaâ series, and at 6.0% in the âElsewhereâ series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These provisional values for 2019 show a slight decrease from final 2018 values, which were 1.9% in the âNorth Seaâ index, and 8.9% in the âElsewhereâ index (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). However, statistical analyses conducted on recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011â2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment to European waters was 26.4% of the 1960â1979 reference in 2018 (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Data collection for 2019 was stated to be ongoing and so not available at the time of publication (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). The overall decline in recruitment will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES 2012). <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Yellow Eel (standing stock): </strong><br/> There were few time-series data sets available to this assessment for the yellow eel life stage, and they only cover a small amount of the geographical range. Data sets were made available from Skagerrak (southern Norway), Den Burg (Netherlands) and the East Anglian River Basin District (RBD) in the UK (Rivers Blackwater, Colne, Chelmer, Stour) (Environment Agency 2019). Skagerrak and Den Burg data derive from beach seines and fyke nets, respectively, and the East Anglian RBD data derive from electrofishing surveys. Data from Skagerrak contained mostly yellow eels, with some silvers, whereas the other data sets were for yellow eel only.<br/> <br/> The analyses of yellow eel data suggest declines that were not as severe as that of recruitment:&#160;in the East Anglian RBD, the mean decline&#160;was between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data,&#160;over a period of three generation lengths (39 years);&#160;in Skagerrak and Den Burg, the mean decline mirrored this trend.&#160;There is a variety of published literature describing abundance trends in yellow eels not captured within this analysis - note the following examples are not comprehensive. In the Bristol Channel, sampling conducted between 1981 and 2009 at power station cooling water intakes found yellow eel abundance to decline by 15% per year, to 1% of the level in 1980 (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, abundance decline has been documented in the River Meuse, in Belgium (Matondo and Ovidio 2016), and Ireland, in both the Foyle Estuary (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Lough Sheelin, in the upper River Shannon catchment (MacNamara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Conversely, a study to establish the status of stocks in England and Wales found rivers along the West coast, and some in the northeast remained similar, whereas declines were observed in the south-east (Bark <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fisheries-independent monitoring conducted on six sites along the Swedish west coast found yellow eel CPUE to display a slow increase between 1975 and 2003, after which it decreased, before increasing again from around 2011 (Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Declines in yellow eels were identified earlier than that of glass eel recruitment, occurring since the 1960âs (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016). The less pronounced decline in the yellow eel data analysed here compared to those reported for glass eel indices could be partially due to density-dependent mortality confounding the effects of changes in recruitment (SvedÃ¤ng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline. </p><p><strong>Silver Eels:</strong><strong><br/> </strong><br/> For silver eels, there is similar uneven geographical spread of data.&#160;Data sets of silver eel escapement were available from France (MNHN-Dinard and UMS PatriNat unpub. data.), Norway and Ireland and were collected from scientific surveys. Note that the silver eel escapement estimates generated for EMPs are only available from 2010 and therefore not dating back long enough to be used in these analyses.</p><p>Based on these data, silver eel decline does not appear as pronounced as for recruitment indices but, similar to yellow eels (standing stock), they indicated a mean decline of&#160;&#160;between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data, over the period of three generation lengths (39 years).&#160;Again, the less pronounced decline compared to recruitment indices may be due to density-dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in recruitment and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>Note</em>: The 2019 ICES data call included a request for available data on abundance trends for the standing stock of yellow and silver eels (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Information collected for yellow eels included long-term monitoring across various habitats for 70 sites, and for silver eels across 28 sites (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These data have not been reported by ICES yet, but future analysis will provide a more accurate understanding of the situation.</p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011), for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007), as well as in Sweden (GÃ¤rdenfors 2010), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN ComitÃ© franÃ§ais, MNHN, SFI and AFB 2019), Ireland (King <em>et al</em>. 2011) and north Belgium (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). Indeed, the European Eel showed the largest negative trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Norway the status is now Vulnerable (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015).<br/> <br/> For the North African range there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that <em>A. anguilla</em> is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).</p><p>Currently, the best estimate metric for translation into the IUCN criteria for âMature Individualsâ is the silver eel life stage, although this has its limitations. Following escapement from continental waters, there is the possibility that a proportion of silver eels may succumb to the effects of sub-lethal impacts incurred during growth / escapement and/or be predated before reaching the breeding area to spawn. </p><p>                      </p><p>An alternative metric that could be used in place of silver eel escapement is numbers of leptocephali collected close to the breeding area, as this would also give an indication of the state of the spawning stock. In 2011, sampling across the breeding area for <em>A. anguilla, A. rostrata</em> and other non-anguillid species was conducted, following the same methods as previous sampling in this area that occurred in 1983 and 1985, just after the beginning of the decline in eels occurred in 1980 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). Results from this study were compared with the previous sampling, and significantly lower numbers of European Eel leptocephali were collected in 2011, with a reduction in catch rate of 89% and 64% compared to sampling in 1983 and 1985, respectively (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation depicts a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding area over this time period, suggesting a reduction in the spawning stock, and correlating with the reduction in recruitment to continental waters. This is of great concern for the future resilience of the population.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> occurs in most inland waters of Europe and is distributed from North Cape in northern Norway, southwards along the coast of Europe, all coasts of the Mediterranean and on the North African coast (Schmidt 1909, Dekker 2003<em>b</em>). It very rarely enters the White and Barents seas, but it has been recorded eastward to the Pechora River in northwest Russia. The species occurs in low abundance in the Black Sea region where it migrates east to the Kuban drainage (occasional individuals reach the Volga drainage through canals). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> also occurs in northern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. A report by the ICES Study Group on Anguillid Eels in Saline Waters (SGAESAW) indicates that eel stocks can contain a mix of freshwater residents, saline water residents, and interâhabitat migrants (ICES 2009). The continental distribution of the European Eel is over an area of approximately 90,000 kmÂ²&#160;in Europe and parts of North Africa (Moriarty and Dekker 1997), with a substantially larger range if their marine distribution is considered. </p><p>For several decades prior to a cessation of import to, and export from, the EU in 2010, <em>A. anguilla</em> was also exported to Asia for seed stock in eel farms (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species may well have been introduced in some parts of Asia (through escape or release from farms, e.g. Arai <em>et al</em>. 2017), however these will not contribute to the spawning stock and therefore areas of introduction have been excluded in the range information. </p><p>    </p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring, before eggs hatch and leptocephalus larvae migrate back across the Atlantic to begin the continental phase of their life history (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk17388906""></a><a name=""_Hlk17388861"">The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver</a>, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent â when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There is clear evidence for this in the case of <em>A. anguilla</em>. Traditionally, European Eel was consumed within its European and North African range states â yellow and silver eels were fished for direct consumption, and glass eels were caught for farming and also for consumption (mainly in Spain). Although still consumed within Europe, in recent decades European Eel became increasingly important in fulfilling demand in East Asia (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crook 2010, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>According to FAO data, total annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production (catch and aquaculture) has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as âseedâ as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Historically, eel farms used species of local provenance. France, Spain, Portugal and the UK are the principal fishing nations for glass eels, and Italy, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands the main producers of farmed European Eel for consumption within Europe. However, towards the end of the 1990s, a decline in stocks of Japanese Eels, combined with the apparently cheap and abundant supplies of European Eel glass eels, led to many Asian eel farms in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, supplementing farms with the European Eel (<a name=""_Hlk17273106"">Briand <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>, Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>Concerns over the impact international trade was having on European Eel led to it being listed in Appendix II of CITES in 2007. This listing came into force on 13 March 2009 â since then any international trade in this species needs to be accompanied by a permit. In December 2010, however, the European Union (EU) decided to ban all imports and exports of European Eel to and from the EU, as authorities felt they were unable to determine that trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of the species (a requirement for issuance of permits for CITES Appendix II-listed species). There were a number of exceptions to this ban: trade in âpre-Conventionâ specimens was permitted until the end of 2015), and internal EU trade is still allowed. Trade from non-EU range States to non-EU countries also still occurs (Musing <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>Global FAO catch data for European Eel are available for the period of 1950â2017, peaking at nearly 20,000 t in 1968 but declining thereafter and between 2013 and 2017, annual catches averaged just over 3,000 t. Over 60% of these catches were reported by five EU Member States: Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The principal non-EU range States reporting catches (10% of the total) were Egypt, Norway, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco (FAO 2019). Fishing of various life stages continues in a number of range States, but in many cases, catch is now being limited by quotas or other measures set as part of National Eel Management Plans, fulfilling requirements outlined in Eel Regulation - see Conservation Measures. Reported annual glass eel landings in the EU have declined since 1980, to 62.2 t in 2018, and 58.6 t in 2019 (provisional) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years. According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008â2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013â2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight; China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown in farms, which includes <em>A. anguilla </em>(Musing<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2018).</p><p>Due to a lack of species-specific Customs data, the precise quantities of European Eel in trade are still unknown. However, imports reported by East Asian Customs of live juvenile <em>Anguilla</em> eels from European Eel range States for farming purposes (defined as âlive eel fryâ in East Asia) provide a good indication of the amount of European glass eels in trade outside of the EU (both legal and illegal). Between 2003 and 2008, annual live eel fry imports from European eel range States to mainland China, Taiwan, Province of China, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong fluctuated between ~36 and 70 t. In 2009, annual imports dropped to ~9 t and in 2010 they increased again to nearly 28 t. Since 2011, reported annual imports of live eel fry from <em>A. anguilla </em>range States remained less than 10 t. France and Spain were the principal source countries among <em>A. anguilla </em>range States until 2010 (when commercial<em> A. anguilla</em> trade to and from the EU was banned). Imports from non-EU <em>A. anguilla </em>range States, especially from Morocco, began in 2009 and gradually increased over the years, despite a ban for export of glass eels being imposed in this range state since 2013 (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). Due to the reduced availability of European glass eels over the last decade, increasing quantities of glass eels of other <em>Anguilla</em> species have also been imported into East Asia to fulfil demand in farms (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>Since 2009, species-specific CITES trade data for European eel have been reported. Between 2009 and 2016, over 1000 t of live <em>A. anguilla </em>and another ~1000 t of meat/bodies were reportedly exported from a number of European Eel range States (mainly Morocco and Tunisia). Main destinations were Korea and Hong Kong. In addition, over 50,000 t of meat/bodies were re-exported, mainly from China to Japan (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There are serious concerns over illegal harvesting and trade of <em>A. anguilla.</em> In recent years, authorities have increasingly reported the involvement of organised criminal networks in the movement of legally and illegally sourced European glass eels from the EU to East Asia, principally to China, and have seen traders regularly change travelling routes and their <em>modus operandi </em>to circumvent controls (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). In 2015, EUROPOL initiated Operation LAKE, a European initiative aimed at combatting illegal eel trade. Under this umbrella, there have been a number of investigations into eel smuggling in air freight and personal luggage. For example, in 2017, Greek and Spanish authorities dismantled an international criminal network suspected of having smuggled 10 t of eels from the EU to China; raids led to the arrest of 32 individuals and seizure of 2 t of <em>A. anguilla </em>worth EUR 2 million (Europol 2017). However, European Eel appears to still be in the supply chain in East Asia â a recent paper indicated it was prevalent in supermarket products in Hong Kong (Richards&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>While there is demand for the species, pressures from trade, and unknown quantities in illegal trade, continue to be a serious conservation concern for the species. </p><p>                    </p><p>A detailed recent analysis of trade in <em>A. anguilla</em>, including Customs, CITES and seizure data, is provided in Musing <em>et al. </em>(2018).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination, which is of particular concern when dealing with a panmictic stock. Protection can be achieved effectively at a national or local level, distributed throughout individual management units, but an international objective is necessary to orchestrate this management (Dekker 2016).<br/> <br/> The Eel Regulation (EC Regulation 1100/2007; EU 2007) is an EU-wide recovery plan for the European Eel, adopted in 2007. As instructed by the regulation, EU member states have been developing and implementing Eel Management Plans (EMPs) with the objective to âreduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.â (EU 2007). Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and most actions have focussed on commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping station obstacles, and measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control (ICES 2013<em>b</em>,&#160;European Commission 2020<em>a</em>). Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries (ICES 2013<em>b</em>).</p><p>In a review of EMPs, eel biomass per hectare fell within a narrow range for most countries, apart from France and Spain, whose values were higher than what was reported for other countries (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). The most recent reporting (2018) did not provide mortality rate estimates for all EMPs, and therefore rates could not be summed to reflect the state of impacts across Europe (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). In December 2017, EU Member States reached an agreement prohibiting fishing for eels &gt;12 cm in marine waters of the Atlantic and North Sea over a three-month period (determined by each Member State) between 2018 and 2019 to aid eel recovery (Council of the EU 2018). In 2019, in line with measures implemented by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), this decision extended the mandatory closures to recreational and glass eel fisheries covering brackish waters (Council of the EU 2019).</p><p> As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total was required to reserve a minimum of 60% of their catch from 31 July 2013 onwards for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking waters with glass eels from elsewhere). Although there is evidence showing restocking to be beneficial at enhancing silver eel production within water bodies, the overall effectiveness of restocking programmes at enhancing the spawning stock remains open to debate (ICES 2016). Reviews (ICES 2012, 2016, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of restocking to the recovery of the panmictic European Eel state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions can be drawn either way. Until restocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012). </p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). Overall, escapement of silver eels remains below the 40% target biomass (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Catches of yellow and silver eel life stages were found to have declined, while glass eel catch has been steadily increasing (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Overall, there has been progress towards a reduction in fishing effort, but in some Member Statesâ effort has risen (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Anthropogenic mortality unrelated to fishing has not significantly declined, and this has received little focus in the EMPs and related actions (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). The report ultimately stated ""The Regulationâs success in ensuring the recovery of the European eel is still far from certain, as it is widely recognised that the recovery of the European eel will take many decades. In this respect, further ambition is needed to implement the Regulation with a greater focus on non-fisheries related measures.""</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16â17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In addition to the Eel Regulation, in 2007, the European eel was included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (CITES 2007). The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time exporters were required to acquire permits. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and export is deemed non-detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF). In 2010, the EUâs Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded an NDF was not possible for this species, and so a zero import/export policy was set for the EU, which is still in place (EC 2010, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2018, several reports investigating the challenges and lessons learnt in relation to implementing the Appendix II listing, including its enforcement and illegal trade were published (CITES 2018, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2008, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010). In 2014, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) to catalyse collaborative conservation across range States, providing additional support for conservation and monitoring of the species (CMS 2014). Since the listing there have been three range state meetings in order to develop a mechanism under which signatories will work. At the most recent CMS Conference of the Parties in 2020, it was agreed a species Action Plan would be developed for the European Eel.</p><p>              </p><p>Across Europe, programmes for âtrap and transportâ (downriver transport), and âassisted migrationâ (upriver transport), are in place to provide eels with access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. When applied to migrating silver eels, it can have a significant and immediate effect on local escapement. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, future recruitment (e.g. for barriers: van der Meer 2012, McCarthy <em>et al.</em> 2014, BÃ©guer-Pon <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by eliminating the barriers to navigation, or at least, providing more effective passage for eels.<br/> <br/> Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. A number of assessment models have been developed; Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam) (Bevacqua and De Leo 2006), Eel Density Analysis (EDA) (EDA 2.2: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2015, EDA 2.2.1: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2018), German Eel Model (GEM) (GEM II: Oeberst and Fladung 2012, GEM III: Oeberst and Fladung 2014), and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II) (SMEP: developed by El-Hosaini, Bark, Knights, Williams and Kirkwood; Aprahamian <em>et al</em>. 2007). Using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe, earlier iterations of these models were reviewed by Walker <em>et al.</em> (2011). The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/> In 2019,&#160; ICES stated that: âThe status of European eel remains criticalâ, and that âall anthropogenic impacts (e.g. caused by recreational and commercial fishing on all stages, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) that decrease production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to,&#160; or kept as close as possible to,&#160; zero in 2020â (ICES 2019<em>b</em>). In 2019, provisional recruitment estimates remain low across the geographical range. Although, recruitment during the period of 2011â2019 has shown an increasing trend, statistically significant from zero. This highlights the necessity for continued, effective conservation across the range for <em>A. anguilla</em>.&#160;</p><p></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The speciesâs breeding sites are poorly-known. It has been considered likely to breed in the coastal desert of southern Peru and northern Chile (Brooke 2004, Carboneras <em>et al. </em>2019), and the speciesâs at-sea distribution and observations of grounded birds have indicated that it nests between 20Â° and 25Â°S in Chile and in Peru (Murillo <em>et al.</em> 2013). Since no large colonies have been found, it has been speculated that the species breeds in âsmall, scattered groupsâ (Brooke 2004). Individuals have been reported inland at Caraz, Peru, c.100 km from the coast and at an altitude of 2,250 m (Gardner 1986 in Brooke 2004) and in the Peruvian Andes from Huaraz to Arequipa, at altitudes of 2,300-3,400 m (Murillo <em>et al. </em>2013). Adults and fledglings attracted to lights have been recorded in localities in desert areas across a broad area of southern Peru (Huarmey, Lima, Lunahuana, Arequipa, Moquegua, Ite and Tacna [Koepcke 1964, Drucker and Jaramillo 2013, Murillo <em>et al.</em> 2013, eBird 2017, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2018]) and northern Chile (Arica, Iquique, Tocopilla, Michilla, Mejillones, Antofagasta, Baquedano, Sierra Gorda and La Negra [Brooke 2000, Brooke 2004, GÃ³mez 2012, eBird 2017, Barros <em>et al.</em> 2018]).

The breeding cavities were located in outcrops of gypsum in an area of pampa, and the authors noted that the breeding area could be much larger than that discovered, based on the large area of similar habitat that was not surveyed (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2018). Further surveys of the same breeding colony in 2018 estimated a population of 7,919 pairs in an area of 129.1 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Medrano <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).

The population is considered to be in decline due to various threats, but the rate of decline is not known. The species is therefore classified as Near Threatened. <br/><p></p>","Markhamâs Storm-petrel breeds in dispersed colonies in saline areas, using fissures and holes created by saltpetre deposits for nesting (Tobias <em>et al</em>. 2006, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Paracas, the species breeds in small, dispersed colonies up to 5 km from the sea on sloping ground<strong> </strong>(Tobias <em>et al. </em>2006). The colonies in Chile are located on the east of the Cordillera de la Costa mountain range at up to 50 km distance from the sea (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). In Chile, known colonies are located at 600-1,100 m a.s.l. (Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). Reproduction can be asynchronous within a colony (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Nevertheless, in the northern colonies in Paracas, near Arica and in Salar de QuiuÃ±a, most pairs lay eggs between April and August, and are with chicks between July and January (Jahnke 1994, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). Pairs breeding in the colonies of Pampa Perdiz, Salar Grande and Salar de Navidad further south lay eggs between November and January, while chicks hatch between January and April (Malinarich <em>et al</em>. 2018, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). The species feeds opportunistically both inshore and offshore on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (Garcia-Godos <em>et al. </em>2002). Adults arrive at the colonies at least 45 min after sunset (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p></p>","The principle threat faced by Markhamâs Storm-petrel is the mining of saltpetre from the salt plain on which it nests (Torres-Mura and Lemus 2013, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). This has resulted in the loss of considerable amounts of breeding habitat, as it destroys the burrows and crevices in which nests are placed (Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Light pollution also represents a significant level of mortality, with 10-20 fresh corpses reported each morning next to a single light close to a breeding colony (Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is assumed that fledglings are attracted to the lights of nearby cities during their first flights (Torres-Mura and Lemus 2013, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015), and already few, strong light sources may affect large parts of a breeding colony (F. Medrano <em>in litt</em>. 2019). It has been estimated that each year around 20,000 fledglings die because of light pollution, representing 1/3 of the entire cohort (F. Medrano <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Light-pollution was found to be a severe threat to seabirds and Hydrobatidae in particular, which can potentially have a detrimental effect on the overall population size (Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further threats include infrastructure developments (roads, wind farms and power lines), military exercises and garbage (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Overall, given the severity of the threats presented by mining and light pollution and their potentially detrimental impacts on the population size, the number of locations of occurrence (as defined by the most severe threat) is assumed to be relatively small.<br/><p></p>","A minimum of 2,305 pairs were present on the Paracas peninsula in 1992<strong> </strong>(Tobias <em>et al. </em>2006).

It breeds on the Paracas peninsula on the coast of central <strong>Peru </strong>and in the Atacama Desert of southern Peru and northern <strong>Chile </strong>(Carboneras 1992, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019).

During this time, a large amount of garbage collects, light pollution increases, and the forest is exploited (Wickramasinghe<em>&#160;</em><em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2013). Tea cultivation in the surrounding areas is slowly expanding, and illegal tree felling to cultivate tea has become a major threat in the area. Within the Peak Wilderness Area, the species is threatened by the presence of naturally occurring invasive<em>&#160;Heliconia sp</em>. that is encroaching on the species habitat (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).&#160;<br/><br/><span id=""docs-internal-guid-f989ed1c-7fff-4874-f587-82f0c9e73917"">Annual rainfall is declining steeply across this region, especially on the perhumid western slopes. This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016).&#160; This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8Â° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1Â° C (De Costa 2008).&#160; These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests). The preponderance of amphibian species in the highlands are&#160;<em>Pseudophilautus</em>&#160;shrub frogs which, being direct developers, are independent of bodies of standing water. Instead, they depend on the ambient moisture of the forest for both homeostasis and reproduction. Highland aridification and warming therefore, are seriousâif as yet unassessedâpotential threats to these species.&#160;<span><br/><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span>Forest dieback could be an additional threat to this species. It was first observed in Sri Lankaâs montane âcloudâ forests by Perera (1978). Despite several studies (see Ranasinghe and Dissanayake 2003, Ranasinghe<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007, Chandrajith<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2009), the aetiology of &#160;dieback remains enigmatic, though there has been concern that an environmental stressor that kills extensive stands of woody vegetation may also impact negatively on amphibians.&#160;Prior to 2013, dieback was never documented in this region and now a large area has been affected (Wickramasinghe<em>&#160;</em><em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Findings from Gunawardena&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1998) and Jayalal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2017) suggest that mist- and rain-water acidity may present a significant risk to the highland biota in Sri Lanka. While there is no direct evidence to date (see&#160;Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019) that amphibians are negatively affected; it is thought to be a problem for species that are found in areas where mist&#160;is present for a long time, and species that are found in open habitats with aquatic life history stages in shallow lentic habitats could be more vulnerable to this threat (M.&#160;Meegaskumbura pers. comm.

For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. <em>Physeter macrocephalus</em> is globally widespread (thus not qualifying as threatened under criterion B), and does not have a global population that warrants listing under criteria C-D. Empirical trend data for this species globally are unavailable. However, commercial whaling at a large scale for this species in the North Pacific and Antarctic within the last three generations (82 years) certainly resulted in a global decline during this period. Commercial whaling for this species has ceased and therefore this population is evaluated under the A1 criterion rather than under the A2-4 criteria. A peer-reviewed publication (Whitehead 2002) provides a model-based estimate of global trend that can be used to evaluate the population under the A1 criterion. The results from that study gave a 6% probability for Endangered, a 54% probability of meeting the Vulnerable category, and a 40% probability of falling into the Near Threatened category. The results suggest little chance that the population would meet the criteria for Endangered or for Least Concern. There is credible and realistic evidence for either the Vulnerable or Near Threatened category. Given that the results give greater probability for at least the Vulnerable category (60%), and that this is the more precautionary category, the species is classified as Vulnerable.","The habitat of the Sperm Whale is the open sea. More specifically, Sperm Whales can be found in almost all marine waters deeper than 1,000 m that are not covered by ice, except in the Black Sea and possibly the Red Sea (Rice 1989; Whitehead 2003). In some areas, particularly in the western North Atlantic, sperm whales, especially males, can occur in shallower waters (e.g., Scott and Sadove 1997). Females and young are usually restricted to waters at latitudes lower than about 40-50Âº and to areas where sea surface temperatures are greater than about 15ÂºC (Rice 1989). Sperm Whales are generally more numerous in areas of relatively high primary productivity (Jaquet <em>et al</em>. 1996), although there are some exceptions, such as the Sargasso Sea and the central North Pacific gyre (Barlow and Taylor 2005).<br/><br/>The Sperm Whale is an animal of extremes in size (up to 18 m), sexual dimorphism (mature males have three times the mass of mature females), ecological imprint (sperm whales take roughly the same amount of biomass from the oceans as humans), and many other attributes (Whitehead 2003). The commercial value of the animal (a function of its size and the quality of Sperm Whale oil) drove two massive worldwide hunts: the technologically primitive âopen-boatâ hunt from 1712-~1920 (Starbuck 1878; Best 1983), and modern whaling using engine-driven whaling ships and harpoon guns from ~1910-1988 (Tonnessen and Johnsen 1982). The complex social structure of sperm whales may have been affected by whaling, lowering potential population growth rates, which are very low anyway (Whitehead 2003). On the positive side, Sperm Whales are very widely distributed (see above), and their primary prey, deep-water squid, are not yet major targets of fisheries.<br/><br/>The generation time (mean age of mothers) for Sperm Whales can be calculated if one assumes a set of population parameters, specifically age at first birth, mortality rate of mature females, and reproductive rate of mature females. There is uncertainty about these parameters, so two calculations were made using different assumptions:<br/><br/>a) Applying the population parameters most recently used for Sperm Whales by the International Whaling Commissionâs Scientific Committee (International Whaling Commission 1982): age at first birth = 10 years; female reproductive rate in unexploited population = 0.20/year; female adult mortality = 0.055/yr): generation time = 27.3 years.<br/><br/>b) The estimates of mortality used by the International Whaling Commission are particularly problematic, and Sperm Whales likely have age-specific survival and reproductive rates. Thus it may be more realistic (Whitehead 2002) to use the well-established mortality schedule of Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 1990) and an age-specific pregnancy rate taken from the sperm whale data presented by Best <em>et al</em>. (1984; pregnancy rate for mature females = 0.257-0.0038xAge in years): generation time = 27.5","The greatest threat to Sperm Whales, extensive commercial whaling, has ceased. However, a number of other threats of various dimensions remain.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales have had a long history of local whaling going back at least to the 1500s and intense commercial whaling beginning around 1712 and continuing to 1988. The âmodernâ highly mechanised phase was particularly intense around 1950, and at its peak killed around 25,000 whales per year, dramatically depleting the global population. In recent decades, some tens of whales were taken each year from small boats in Indonesia (Reeves 2002), although none have been taken in the last two years (H. Whitehead pers. comm.), and 10 are taken annually by Japan under IWC Special Permit (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, has been a particular problem in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2006), but Sperm Whales die from entanglement in nets and lines in many other areas and in a variety of fisheries as well (e.g., Haase and FÃ©lix 1994; Barlow and Cameron 2003). Considering the widespread distribution of Sperm Whales, observations of occasional takes in relatively small scale gillnet fisheries (e.g. Barlow and Cameron 2003) suggest much larger takes in unobserved, unregulated high seas driftnet fisheries such as were common before the 1989 adoption of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly. <br/><br/>Sperm Whales sometimes take fish off fishing gear (most often demersal long-line gear), an activity known as âdepredation.â Depredation of long-line catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., South East Alaska, Chile, South Georgia and several other southern ocean island areas, North Atlantic). This interaction has resulted in a few reported entanglements and deaths (e.g. Salas 1987; Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004), and has incurred hostility from some fishermen (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998; Donoghue <em>et al</em>. 2003), including shooting of whales (GonzÃ¡lez and OlivarrÃ­a 2002).<br/><br/>Sperm Whale tissues have high levels of some contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000); however, any population-level effects on health are unknown. The effects of noise on Sperm Whales are also uncertain. Some evidence suggests that they are highly sensitive to noise (e.g., Watkins <em>et al</em>. 1985; Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1994) while other studies have found little or no effect (e.g., Madsen and MÃ¸hl 2000; Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002). To date, all published studies of Sperm Whales and noise focus on short-term behavioural effects. Avoidance of sonar (Dawson pers. comm.) and seismic surveys (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1994; but see Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002) has been observed but no mortality has been documented.<br/><br/>Whaling on Sperm Whales has at various times focussed almost exclusively on one sex or the other. Removals of large numbers of males may have had lingering effects on pregnancy rates in some subpopulations (Best 1979; Clarke <em>et al</em>. 1980; Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997) and large males are noticeably uncommon on some breeding grounds (Whitehead 2003). The removal of large numbers of females from social groups, and of older females in particular, may have lingering, socially disruptive effects. Furthermore, recovery might be inhibited via temporary or permanent loss of social cohesion and of socio-ecological knowledge such as is known to occur in other large-brained, long-lived social mammals (e.g., elephants, Poole and Thomsen 1989). <br/><br/>Maximum rates of increase for Sperm Whale populations are very low, possibly on the order of 1% per year (Whitehead 2002). Population growth/recovery can be expected to be low in the species.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales face other threats at a more regional level. These include collisions with ships (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001), for instance off the Canary Islands (AndrÃ© and Potter 2000) and in the Mediterranean (Pesante <em>et al</em>. 2002), and ingestion of marine debris in the Mediterranean (e.g., Viale <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/><br/>Causes for optimism: On the one hand, the Sperm Whale is not being heavily whaled at present and seems relatively secure from this threat in the short and medium term. When not being actively hunted, the Sperm Whale has rather little interaction with humans: most of its habitat is far from land, and few of its food sources (principally deep-water squid) are of currently harvested (Clarke 1977). Some populations, for instance the animals in the western North Atlantic that were little affected by modern whaling, seem healthy with reasonably high population densities and evidence of satisfactory reproduction (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1998; National Marine Fisheries Service 2000).<br/><br/>Causes for concern: on the other hand, the Sperm Whale, with a maximum rate of increase of around 1% per year (Whitehead 2002), is not well adapted to recover from population depletion. Furthermore, the population model considers only one anthropogenic threat, whaling, and thus posits that the Sperm Whale population has recovered since about 1980 (Fig. 1 in linked PDF document), when large-scale commercial whaling was rapidly coming to an end. This recovery is purely theoretical, and may not be occurring as sperm whales carry high levels of some chemical contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000), ocean noise is increasing (Gordon and Moscrop 1996), interactions with fisheries continue to result in sperm whale deaths (International Whaling Commission 1994), and the lingering, socially disruptive effects of whaling may be inhibiting recovery of this highly social species (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). Some regional populations of sperm whales are declining or are apparently not recovering from depletion. Even in the absence of whaling, the Mediterranean population appears to have declined over the past 20 years, with bycatch in driftnets a likely principal cause (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The southeastern Pacific Sperm Whale population, very heavily whaled during the period 1950-1980, has an extremely low recruitment rate (probably below replacement), perhaps because of the social disruption caused by intense whaling (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). The population of mature and maturing males in the Antarctic was also heavily whaled over the same period, but should have repopulated from less heavily exploited breeding populations at lower latitudes following the end of large-scale commercial whaling. However, systematic surveys of Sperm Whales in the Antarctic showed no substantial or statistically significant increase between 1978 and 1992 (Branch and Butterworth 2001).","The only recent quantitative analysis of sperm whale population trends (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material, which constitutes an integral part of this assessment) suggests that a pre-whaling global population of about 1,100,000 had been reduced by about 29% by 1880 through âopen-boatâ whaling, and then to approximately 360,000 (67% reduction from initial) by the 1990s through modern whaling, although much uncertainty is associated with all these estimates (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). There is no direct evidence that any part of the population has increased since the end of large-scale whaling in about 1980, although for most areas there is also no direct evidence that they have not. In some areas there is concern that populations are continuing to decline (see below).<br/><br/>The species has a huge geographic range (Rice 1989) and a global population size in the 100,000's (Whitehead 2002; Fig 1). Although there is considerable uncertainty about sperm whale population parameters and levels of exploitation, Whitehead (2002) estimated historical trajectories of sperm whale abundance incorporating many, but not all, sources of uncertainty (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). That model was modified slightly (to produce an endpoint in 2003) and run to estimate the decline in global sperm whale population size between 1921 and 2003 (i.e. over approximately 3 generations; 82yr; see below for estimation of generation time) (H. Whitehead pers. comm.). As sperm whale population size seems to have changed rather little between about 1910-1930 (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material), the calculations are probably quite robust with reference to the estimated generation time. Using the âbestâ estimates of the model parameters (as in Whitehead 2002), the population in 2003 would have been 44% of that in 1921. Of 1,000 runs using model parameters randomly selected from within reasonable ranges (as in Whitehead 2002), 6% gave populations in 2003 of &lt;30% of that in 1922, 54% gave a 2003 population between 30-50% of that in 1992, and 40% suggested depletion levels of less than 50% over this time.<br/><br/> Arguments can be made that the model results are overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. Factors that would contribute to making the results overly optimistic that are not accounted for in the model include not accounting for under-reporting of illegal Soviet catches in the North Pacific and Antarctica and under-reporting of Japanese catches in the North Pacific (Kasuya and Brownell 2001), other continuing threats (described below), and factors such as continuing effects of social disruption from whaling that might inhibit recovery (consistent with an apparent lack of recovery in many areas). Factors that would contribute to making the results overly pessimistic include the assumption of a relatively low rate of increase in the model and the extrapolation of a relatively high estimate of g(0) (the proportion of whales detected on the trackline) from a single study to the global population. The direction of the effect of other uncertainties in model inputs, including the effects of sex-biased catches, is not certain. Despite these uncertainties, the Whitehead model provides the best available scientific evidence upon which to base this assessment. To reduce these uncertainties, future analyses would need to address the concerns identified above. <br/><br/>Efforts to assess the conservation status of sperm whales and the impact of historical whaling on contemporary structure are compromised by the absence of a good model of sperm whale population structure; pooling data may obscure distinct geographic patterns. While Sperm Whales are known to show long distance movements (Ivashin and Rovnin 1967; Mitchell 1975) and low genetic differentiation among ocean basins, several lines of evidence suggest that sperm whales past and present, have significant geographic structure. Analyses based on historical and contemporary data from tagging records (Rice 1974; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988), blood types (Fujino 1963), catch distributions, sighting patterns, size composition, lack of recovery from exploitation (Japan), timing of pregnancy (Best <em>et al</em>.1984), photo-identification (Whitehead 2003), genetics (Drouot 2004; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999), cultural markers (Rendell and Whitehead 2003) and combinations thereof (Bannister and Mitchell 1980; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988) suggest evidence for structure in many regions. Over the past decade, several authors have investigated population structure in female Sperm Whales using sequence variation within the mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) and/or polymorphic nuclear loci (microsatellites). In general, results tend to find low genetic differentiation among ocean basins and little evidence of subdivision within ocean basins, with the exception of some isolated basins such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (Lyrholm <em>et al</em>. 1999; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999; Drouot <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, factors such as low sample sizes, low mtDNA haplotypic diversity and social structure alone and together reduce the power to detect population structure. In addition, it is clear that biologically discrete populations of odontocetes can occur independently of strong geographic or oceanographic features. Alternative, non-geographic based hypotheses of population structure, such as dialect and differences in diet such as are found in Killer Whales, have not been thoroughly examined. For example, Rendell and Whitehead (2003) suggest that female populations seem to be culturally structured within oceans by âcodaâ vocalizations and may be genetically distinct (Rendell and Whitehead 2005, Rendell <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Unknown,"The Sperm Whale has a large geographic range (Rice 1989).

178589687,41712,Eubalaena glacialis,Critically Endangered,C2a(ii),2020,2020-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The estimated number of North Atlantic Right Whales alive at the end of 2018 was&#160;409 individuals (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020), of which fewer than 250 were mature. The population was declining during 2011â2020 due to a combination of increased mortality rates (driven primarily by entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes) and reproductive rates below the average for previous years. Because the former eastern North Atlantic subpopulation of Right Whales, if it still exists, contains at most a few individuals, it can be assumed that the western North Atlantic subpopulation contains over 90% of North Atlantic Right Whales. The species therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(ii).","Right Whales feed on calanoid copepods and other small invertebrates (smaller copepods, euphausids (krill), pteropods, and larval barnacles), generally by slowly skimming through patches of concentrated prey at or below the surface (Mayo and Marx 1990). The most common prey species is the copepod <em>Calanus finmarchicus</em> (Baumgartner <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Relative abundance of Right Whales has been positively correlated with copepod density off the northeastern United States (Pendleton <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also correlated with sea surface temperature, sediment type, and bathymetry (Good 2008). Baumgartner and Mate (2005) attached satellite-monitored radio tags to Right Whales in the Bay of Fundy in order to investigate their habitat use. They found that when the tagged animals left the Bay, they did not frequently visit the deep basins of the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf, where abundance of <em>C. finmarchicus </em>was thought to be high. Instead, the whales visited areas characterized by low bottom water temperatures, high surface salinity, and high surface stratification.","Right Whales in the North Atlantic are no longer hunted, and the most serious current threat is death and injury from entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes off the east coast of North America (Kraus <em>et al</em>. 2016). During 2012â2016, there were 30 confirmed human-caused deaths or serious injuries, including 26 entanglements and two ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2019). Because some human-caused deaths probably pass undetected, the reported events are minima. Entanglement events appear to be increasing in both frequency and severity (Knowlton <em>et al</em>. 2016). A further 30 deaths were recorded during 2017â19 of which 21 were in Canadian and nine in US waters (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Photo-identification images revealed that most individual Right Whales (82.9%) bear evidence of being entangled at least once while over half (59.0%) of the individuals have been entangled more than once. The evidence suggests that Right Whales acquire new entanglement scars on a nearly annual basis, juvenile whales at a higher rate than adults (Knowlton <em>et al</em>. 2012). Based on observations during 1995â2008 of 50 free-living individuals observed to be carrying fishing gear, compared with 459 individuals never seen with gear during that period, Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a mortality rate of approximately 25% during the first year after which the individual was first seen with gear. Because some deaths may occur before the whale is seen with gear, this provides a minimum estimate of the mortality rate of entangled whales in addition to those that die immediately following entanglement. Even if not directly fatal, entanglement is detrimental to the whaleâs energy balance leading to poorer body condition, lower reproduction and lower survival (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2017, van der Hoop <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In the Bay of Fundy and on the Scotian Shelf (Canada), from 2004 to 2008, groundfish hook-and-line gear was found to pose the greatest risk to Right Whales during the summer, and lobster gear during the spring and autumn migration periods (Vanderlaan <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, of 12 Right Whale deaths recorded in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in summer 2017, six were examined, and the cause of death was found to be entanglement in snow crab fishing gear in two cases and suspected to be blunt trauma consistent with vessel strike in four cases. In addition, five live whales were observed entangled including at least four in snow crab gear. Three of those whales were freed by human intervention or freed themselves, and the fate of the remaining two was unknown (Daoust <em>et al</em>. 2017, Taylor and Walker 2017).<br/><br/>Right Whales appear to be the most vulnerable large whales to ship strikes (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2007). Ship strikes were found to be the cause of death for 53% of the 40 Right Whales necropsied between 1970 and 2006 and could have been responsible for up to 10 individual North Atlantic Right Whale deaths per year (Vanderlaan <em>et al</em>. 2009). Confirmed Right Whale deaths due to ship strikes declined from 2.0 (2000â2006) to 0.4 per year (2012â2016) (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2019). The decrease may have been due, in part, to spatial mitigation efforts (so-called Seasonal Management Areas, or SMAs) implemented in U.S. waters in 2008 (van der Hoop <em>et al</em>. 2015). The SMAs were designed to correspond to Right Whale feeding, calving, and migration areas and it is estimated that this mitigation effort reduced mortality by 80â90% (Conn and Silber 2013). The risk of ship strike was reduced by an estimated 82% due to an âArea to Be Avoidedâ vessel-routing initiative implemented by the International Maritime Organization in the Roseway Basin Area on the Scotian Shelf (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2009). However, the shift in summer distribution of Right Whales may have increased their exposure to ship strikes in the most recent years.<br/><br/>Low-frequency in-water noise from shipping activity has been linked to physiological stress (increased glucocorticoid levels) in North Atlantic Right Whales (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2012), but the evidence is weak. Acoustic masking from anthropogenic noise (especially ship noise) may negatively affect both reproduction by interfering with courtship vocalizations and prey acquisition by interfering with communication and reducing feeding opportunities (Hatch <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Environmental neurotoxins produced as a result of harmful algal blooms have the potential to affect reproduction and development. Paralytic shellfish toxin and domoic acid that were detected in faecal samples indicate that Right Whales are exposed to environmental neurotoxins on an annual basis for up to six months of the year (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2002, Doucette <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Climate change appears to have caused a northward shift in the summer distribution of North Atlantic Right Whales, likely due to effects on prey distribution, which exposes the Right Whales to shipping and entanglement risks over a greater area (Meyer-Gutbrod <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><p></p>  <p></p>","<strong>Northwest Atlantic<br/></strong>Based mainly on photo-identification data, the North Atlantic Right Whale population was estimated to have been increasing at an average rate of 2.8% per year from 1990 to 2011, peaking at about 480 individuals in 2011. Abundance has been declining since 2011, to an estimated 409 individuals by the end of 2018. Reproduction has declined as reflected in both lower calf counts (average 10 calves per year observed during 2012â19, compared with 24 per year during 2004â11) and longer calving intervals. Associated with a lower estimated survival rate for females, the female proportion in the population is estimated to be only about 40%, despite a birth sex ratio close to 50:50. During 2017â19, only 12 calves were observed but 30 deaths were documented. (Pace <em>et al</em>. 2017, Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160; <br/><br/>There has also been a change since 2011 in patterns of habitat use (IWC 2017). There has been a northward shift in summer distribution into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, leaving fewer whales in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine (Stokstad 2017).<br/><br/>Calf counts have been conducted since 1980, and calf production has fluctuated. It was particularly low during 1998â2000 and again during 2012-2019, with no calves at all observed in 2018 (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020). Years of low calf production have been correlated with environmental conditions (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2003) and with poor body condition of adults (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016). Based on the pattern of occurrence in the calving grounds of females at different stages in the calving cycle, Browning <em>et al</em>. (2010) inferred that there is considerable cryptic perinatal mortality in addition to known calf deaths. For the period 1989â2003, those authors documented 191 surviving calves and 17 known calf deaths and estimated a further 28 cryptic calf deaths.<br/><br/>The demographics of North Atlantic Right Whales compare unfavourably with those of Southern Right Whales in terms of birth and death rates as well as indicators of health (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016, Corkeron <em>et al</em>. 2018). The occurrence of skin lesions of a kind not seen in Southern Right Whales was recorded in North Atlantic Right Whales during the period 1995 to 2002, and appeared to be correlated with the failure of females that would normally have been ready to have reproduced on schedule (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2007). Body condition as measured by blubber thickness was poorer in the North Atlantic Right Whales than in Southern Right Whales (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>Due to the paucity of records in recent times (see Geographic Range), and the fact that all photographed sightings have been identified as migrants from the west, it seems unlikely that there is a remnant northeast Atlantic breeding subpopulation. It is also unclear whether in the past the animals in the northeastern part of the range (off Iceland and Norway) belonged mainly to the western or eastern breeding subpopulations, or to what degree the two breeding subpopulations were separate.<br/><br/><strong>Historical population size</strong><br/>The first documented records of Basque whaling in the Bay of Biscay are from the 11th century (Rey-Iglesia <em>et al</em>. 2018). At least dozens of Right Whales were killed each year in the Bay of Biscay until a marked decline was evident by 1650, and whaling declined during the 18th century. Basque whalers arrived in Iceland as early as 1412, and participated in the Right Whale fishery around the British Isles and Norway from the 14th to the 18th century, but probably many more whales were taken by Dutch, Danish, British, and Norwegian whalers. Quantitative estimates of catches are not available. Historical âright whaleâ catches as far north as Iceland and Norway appear to have been mainly <em>Eubalaena glacialis</em>, with Bowhead Whales being the main species only in the far north (Greenland and Svalbard) (Aguilar 1986). Smith <em>et al</em>. (2006) documented extensive whaling for Right Whales in the North Cape area (northern Norway) in the 17th century. Right Whale hunting in the northeastern Atlantic seems to have declined from the mid-17th century and all but disappeared by the mid-18th century, but there was a brief period of Right Whale catches by modern whalers operating from shore stations in the northwestern British Isles and off Iceland, with at least 120 Right Whales taken during 1881â1924 (Collett 1909, Brown 1986). The last recorded catch was a cow-calf pair off Madeira in 1967, accompanied by a third individual that escaped. There is some archaeological and historical evidence for a Right Whale wintering ground in the Mediterranean Sea in classical times, with a likely fishery near the Straits of Gibraltar (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>It is not clear when Basque whaling first spread to the western North Atlantic, but it had been established no later than 1530. It had long been thought that large numbers (tens of thousands) of Right Whales were taken off Labrador and Newfoundland by the Basques between 1530 and 1610 (Aguilar 1986, Reeves 2001) but recent genetic evidence suggests that many, if not most, of these were Bowheads (Rastogi <em>et al</em>. 2004, McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2008). Shore-based whaling along the U.S. east coast began in the mid-17th century and continued at least sporadically over the next two and a half centuries (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>Historical catches, particularly in the northeastern Atlantic, are insufficiently documented to allow estimation of the pre-whaling population size. Monsarrat <em>et al</em>. (2016) used historical catches in the North Pacific, which are better documented, to relate pre-whaling Right Whale summer abundance to habitat parameters, and then applied this relationship to the North Atlantic. This resulted in an estimated pre-whaling total abundance in the North Atlantic of 9,000â21,000, based on ecological carrying capacity. Much of this population is predicted to have summered in the Norwegian Sea and on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong></strong>",Decreasing,"The Right Whale formerly was common on both sides of the North Atlantic. It appears to be effectively extirpated in the eastern North Atlantic but in the past probably ranged from a calving ground in the Golfo de Cintra (23Â°N) off Western Sahara, through the Azores, Bay of Biscay, western British Isles, and the Norwegian Sea to the North Cape (hence the Dutch, German and Scandinavian name Noordkaper / Nordkaper) (Rice 1998). It may also have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2018). In the western North Atlantic the species migrates from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia along the eastern seaboard of North America, to summering grounds largely in the Gulf of Maine, south of Cape Cod, Bay of Fundy, Scotian Shelf, and Gulf of Saint Lawrence.<br/><br/>Today, North Atlantic Right Whales are regularly seen in the winter calving grounds off Florida and Georgia, and in spring/summer feeding grounds in Cape Cod Bay and south of Cape Cod, the Great South Channel off Massachusetts, the Gulf of Maine, the Scotian Shelf, the Bay of Fundy, and increasingly in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2019). There have been a few sightings off Cape Farewell (southern tip of Greenland) (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Iceland (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2007), and in the Gulf of Mexico (Ward-Geiger <em>et al</em>. 2011). Adult females appear to migrate to the southern calving grounds in winters in which they bear a calf while most males and other females do not migrate to the calving grounds, especially after summers with below-average prey abundance (Gowan <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>There have been very few sightings in the northeast Atlantic in recent times. A possible Right Whale was sighted in the Bay of Biscay in 1977 (Aguilar 1981) and a cow-calf pair was sighted off Cape Vincent, Portugal in 1995 (Martin and Walker 1997). One Right Whale was apparently sighted off the island of Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea) in 1991, but a survey of the former Cintra Bay calving ground off Western Sahara failed to locate any Right Whales (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 1998). Individual Right Whales sighted off Norway in 1999, off the Azores in 2009 (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2012) and off France in 2019 (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020) have each been identified as animals from the western North Atlantic subpopulation (Jacobsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Silva <em>et al</em>. 2012, Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020). There have been unconfirmed reports from northwest Ireland and the Canary Islands. <br/><br/>The distribution map shows where the species is known to occur, based on confirmed records post-1900, and may occur, based on oceanography. The species has not been recorded for all the states within the hypothetical range as shown on the map.",This North Atlantic Right Whale is no longer hunted. It was once the target of major commercial whaling.,Marine,"Right Whales have been protected from hunting by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling since it came into force in 1948, and by its predecessor in the 1930s. The North Atlantic Right Whale is listed as Endangered under both the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the Canadian Species At Risk Act and it is listed in Appendix I of both the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.<br/><br/>Efforts are underway in both the U.S. and Canada aimed at limiting North Atlantic Right Whale deaths and injuries due to ship strikes and entanglements. In both countries, recovery plans have been implemented. In U.S. waters, mandatory time-area speed restrictions in the form of Seasonal Management Areas were implemented in 2008 in an effort to reduce the frequency and severity of ship strikes. A Mandatory Ship Reporting Scheme has been in place since 1999 in two areas of the Right Whale calving and summering grounds to warn vessels of whalesâ presence. Regulations specify minimum approach distances for whale-watching and other vessels. Regulations are in place in the U.S. involving restrictions on certain types of fishing gear in areas where, and times when, Right Whales are common. Pace <em>et al</em>. (2015) found that measures adopted prior to 2009 to reduce entanglements had not been effective. New measures adopted since 2009 have yet to be evaluated (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>Canada has introduced measures to limit ship speeds and close areas to snow crab, lobster and other non-tended fixed-gear fishing in areas where Right Whales are common and in other areas following sightings of Right Whales (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2019). <strong></strong>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is known from six stranded or drifting specimens off Hokkaido, Japan; one from Kunashir Island and two from Sakhalin Island, Russia; and two from Unalaska Island (eastern Aleutian Islands) and a few from the Alaska Peninsula, USA (Morin <em>et al.</em> 2017, Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Fedutin <em>et al. </em>2020). Because this species is easily confused with Bairdâs Beaked Whale in the wild, it could either be rare or uncommon (see Supplementary Information for definitions), though the paucity of strandings makes being rare more likely. The distribution is limited to cold-temperate waters of the North Pacific west of the Gulf of Alaska. Anthropogenic threats have been identified, including direct hunting and bycatch.<br/><br/>Satoâs Beaked Whale<em> </em>was not assessed previously as it was only described as a new species in August 2019. The Red List Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) state that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.â However, LC is not plausible because the species is likely rare and has a relatively small distribution such that demographically independent populations that could buffer risk cannot be assured and with known threats in a substantial portion of that distribution (see the Supplementary Information). Small numbers of human-caused deaths can result in declines in cetaceans given their low maximum growth rates. Given that the advice in the Guidelines is to be precautionary, Least Concern is not an option. Data on the distribution of Satoâs Beaked Whale come primarily from strandings, and densities across the speciesâ known range are unknown. Well-documented threats, including direct hunting and bycatch, may be present in more than half of the total distribution, if the western portion of the range contains more than half of the total population of Satoâs Beaked Whale. Should that be the case, the most plausible categories would be CR and EN. However, the converse is also true; that is, if the western portion of the range contains less than half of the total population, then the risk to the species is less and the plausible categories range from EN to NT (see the Supplementary Information for further explanation) under criterion A4b. Overall, plausible categories range from CR to NT. Given the large uncertainties about this newly named species, the category Near Threatened, which applies to taxa that do not qualify as threatened now, but may be close to qualifying for at least Vulnerable, is the most appropriate.</p>","Almost nothing is known about habitats and ecology of Satoâs Beaked Whale but these are assumed to be similar to Baird's Beaked Whale, with primary habitat on or near the continental slope and on or near oceanic seamounts in cold-temperate waters. Like Baird's Beaked Whales, Satoâs Beaked Whales probably feed mainly on deepwater and bottom-dwelling gadiform fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2009).","<p>Little specific information is available on anthropogenic threats to Satoâs Beaked Whale (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019). </p>  <p>Although there has never been a directed hunt for Satoâs Beaked Whales, they could well be taken at least occasionally in the directed hunt for Bairdâs Beaked Whales in the Okhotsk Sea off northern Hokkaido, Japan (Kasuya 2017).&#160; One unidentified <em>Berardius</em> assumed to have been a Satoâs Beaked Whale was killed incidentally in fishing gear off Shibetsu, Hokkaido in July 2004 (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Fig. 1). Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and beaked whales are known to become entangled and drown in such gear (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009). The extent of this threat to Satoâs Beaked Whales is unknown.</p>  <p>There is increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as those from active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar by military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact causes of such strandings are often not clear, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005). There is one documented mass stranding of Bairdâs Beaked Whales in Japan and two in Mexico.</p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Macroplastic items can block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Subramanian et al.

Organochlorine and halogenated dimethylbipyrrole residues have been identified in the tissues of Bairdâs Beaked Whales (Prudente <em>et al</em>. 1997, Haraguchi <em>et al</em>. 2006) and various mesoplodonts (Kajiwara<em> et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016).

Breeding effort and performance are lower when anchovy abundance is low (Hunt and Butler 1980)<strong></strong>. Adults enter and leave the nesting colonies at night when there is little or no moon, typically arriving on the Channel Islands in mid-February. Nesting persists through mid-June with peak nesting from late March to late April (Jones <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2005). Clutches consist of two eggs laid approximately eight days apart with replacement of lost clutches unusual. Incubation takes c.34 days (Jones<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005). There are no recent records of them breeding under shrubs on top of Anacapa Island, a habitat used frequently on nearby, rat-free, Santa Barbara Island (Jones <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2005).<p></p>","<p>Invasive mammals were responsible for all known and suspected colony extinctions in the past and pose an ongoing threat by being present in all the larger colonies and former colonies (McChesney and Tershy 1998). Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> depredate chicks and adults. Heavy cat predation was recorded on North Coronado until the mid-1990s (Jehl and Bond 1975, Drost and Lewis 1995). The cat population at Catalina was most recently estimated at 600-750 individuals (Guttila and Stapp 2010) and eradication of cats and rats on the island has been regarded as ânot currently feasibleâ (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2014). Despite this however, many introduced predators have been removed from a number of breeding islands in recent decades (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Keitt 2005, Birt <em>et al</em>. 2012) with post-eradication increases noted (Whitworth and Carter 2017); the eradication of cats on some islands off the coast of western Baja California (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San MartÃ­n and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities (Whitworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> prey on murrelet eggs and adults (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2014). Eradication of rats at Anacapa Island in 2001â2002 greatly improved murrelet hatching success in the following years (2003â2010) (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2013), with 191% more eggs hatching and 94% fewer nests being depredated (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2016). Hatching success remains very low on islands including St. Clementine however, a result of ongoing predation by foxes and black rats (Whitworth <em>et al</em>. 2018). House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> were recently introduced to the Coronados Islands, and Deer Mice&#160;<em>Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae</em> (native to nearby Cedros Island) have also been introduced to the San Benito Islands. Deer Mice depredated 46% of all monitored eggs on Santa Barbara (Murray <em>et al</em>. 1983), which is the largest known breeding site for the species (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, on Anacapa, Deer Mice were established long before the introduction of rats, precluding them from consideration as the cause of declines there (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Another problematic native species is the Barn Owl <em>Tyto alba</em>. Annual estimates of owl predation on Santa Barbara range from 11 to 172 individuals (Thomsen and Harvey 2012, Thomsen <em>et al</em>. 2013, Nur <em>et al</em>. 2013). Population growth modelling based on data collected between 1991 and 2010, resulted in an estimate of a 1.17% population decline owing to owl predation, and projections of a hypothetical 50-80% reduction in predation pressure could potentially result in a 1.15-2.54% positive growth rate, barring an increase in egg depredation from island mouse populations (Nur <em>et al</em>. 2013). This assessment implicated the role of Barn Owls in the suppression of the Scrippsâs Murrelet population recovery on Santa Barbara Island although recent evidence suggests that the presence of Barn Owls on Santa Barbara may have an indirect <em>positive</em>&#160;influence on Murrelet egg survival through increased predation on deer mice, and resultantly reduced egg predation from the mice themselves (Thomsen and Green 2016). Such interactions however, have been shown to shift with changing&#160;El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rainfall conditions as changing rainfall, vegetation abundance and resultantly deer mouse populations can result in 15-fold increases in the predation of Murrelet by Owls in the absence of mice as a food source (Thomsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). It has recently been evidenced that fecundity is dramatically reduced during drought years due to enhanced egg predation by deer mice and population declines may result (Thomsen and Green 2019). Any increase in the frequency or severity of drought conditions will likely increase the rate of population decline in response.</p>  <p>Various forms of pollution are threatening the species. The potential impacts of large and small oil spills in congregation waters near breeding islands is of great concern (Carter <em>et al</em>. 2000, Burkett <em>et al</em>. 2003). Long Beach Harbour is the largest oil port in western North America, with daily arrivals and departures of large oil tankers (USFWS 2005). Frequent oil spills occur in the vicinity of Long Beach Harbour, but most have not affected waters near Catalina (Carter 2003, Whitworth <em>et al</em>. 2014). As stated by Drost and Lewis (1995), pollution from offshore oil-wells or the Los Angeles oil-tanker lane could potentially extirpate the species from the south California Bight. Organochlorine pollutants are considered not to have a current significant effect on murrelets breeding at Catalina, but may have caused reduced reproduction or population size in the past, especially between the 1940s and 1970s, prior to the end of production and dumping of DDT in southern California waters (Drost and Lewis 1995, Whitworth <em>et al</em>. 2014). The potential impacts of bright lights used by squid fishing boats near breeding colonies is another concern, potentially causing disorientation and elevated predation pressures. Many owl-predated murrelets were found during a period of intense inshore squid fishing around Santa Catalina and disturbance from related activities could discourage nest-visitation and possibly cause collision mortalities (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>Human disturbance has been identified as a cause of nest abandonment and a major threat to the species (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). The two highest rates of abandonment on record were observed at the Dock and the Bunkhouse plots, which are directly associated with human structures. The human disturbance associated with these sites may also affect the remaining nesting birds. Machinery operations at the dock include high decibel engine noise and vibration of the dock structure, which along with frequent traffic, could be affecting nesting murrelets beneath the decking of these structures (Howard <em><em>et al</em>.</em> 2015).</p><p>Extreme fluctuations of sea surface temperature related to ENSO, are likely to affect food availability for the species, though the impact of such events appears to be small due to their generalist prey (USFWS 2016). In addition, the species's foraging behaviour puts it at risk from gill-net fisheries, although very few incidences have been reported (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2000). No mortality has been reported in nearshore gill-net fisheries in which other seabirds have relatively high bycatch rates (Pacific Seabird Group undated). However, the white seabass gill-net fishery operating around the northern California Channel Islands has very little observer coverage, potentially indicating that bycatch incidence has been underestimated or completely overlooked (Pacific Seabird Group undated).</p><p></p>","Birt <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimate the total number of breeding pairs to be in excess of 6,500, which equated to 13,000 mature individuals. Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population at 15,000, hence it is placed here in the band for 10,000-19,999 mature individuals, assumed to equate to 15,000-30,000 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"<em>Synthliboramphus scrippsi</em> breeds on islands off southern California, <strong>U.S.A.</strong> (San  Miguel, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Barbara, San Clemente, and, formerly,  Santa Catalina) and western Baja California, <strong>Mexico</strong> (San Benito, Todos Santos and the  Coronado and San JerÃ³nimo islands) (Chesser <em>et al</em>. 2012, Whitworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). On  large islands, the species is confined largely or entirely to offshore  rocks (Drost and Lewis 1995). Breeding on San MartÃ­n and Cedros Islands,  Baja California, is less certain but presumed present (Chesser <em>et al</em>. 2012, Whitworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). In the U.S.A., an estimated 885-2,575 breeding pairs occur, the biggest colony on the island of Santa Barbara holds 500-1,250 pairs (B. Keitt and D. Whitworth <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Small numbers breed on Anacapa (200-600 pairs), Santa Cruz (100-300 pairs), San Miguel (50-300 pairs), and San Clemente islands (10-50 pairs), U.S.A. (Sowls <em>et al.</em> 1980, Hunt <em>et al.</em> 1981, Carter <em>et al.</em> 1992, Drost and Lewis 1995)<strong></strong>. The Santa Barbara colony has been stable since the 1980s, but may have declined since the turn of the century (B. Keitt and D. Whitworth <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. The breeding population size on the islands off western Baja California was estimated between 2002-2008 at 1686-4428 pairs, and despite likely being extirpated on all islands excluding Coronado and San Benito in the past (Bedolla-GuzmÃ¡n <em>et al</em>. 2019), it has returned to breed at all such locations. Numbers are estimated to include 1117-2933 pairs at Isla Coronado, 262-688 at Todos Santos, 19-49 at San&#160;MartÃ­n, 24-64 at San JerÃ³nimo, 231-607 at San Benito and 33-87 on the Cedros Islands (Whitworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). The eradication of cats on some such islands (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San MartÃ­n and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities. The species winters offshore from northern California (rarely) south to southern Baja California (Chesser <em>et al</em>. 2012).

In 2003, fishing and other extractive uses were banned within important areas of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary in an attempt to reduce light and noise pollution in important near-shore staging areas.

The population has undergone a population increase due to previous conservation efforts. Albeit, based on threats such as invasive species, fisheries and climatic events, habitat quality is thought to be undergoing a continued decline.&#160;It consequently qualifies as Near Threatened. If ongoing and potential threats continue to degrade the species's habitat however, it may warrant uplisting in the future.&#160;<p></p> <p></p>","It excavates deep burrows in thick guano for nesting, but may also burrow in sandy soils or use natural rock crevices. Breeding has been recorded throughout the year (Riveros-Salcedo and Jahncke Aparicio 1990, Jahncke and Goya 1998)<strong></strong>, with least activity in November. There are two breeding periods, with some evidence that individual birds breed twice annually (Riveros-Salcedo and Jahncke Aparicio 1990, Jahncke and Goya 1998, M. de L. Brooke <em>verbally </em>2000)<strong></strong>. In the non-breeding season, it occurs close to breeding islands in the rich upwelling waters of the Humboldt Current. In Peru, it feeds, even in heavily fished areas, on small crustaceans and small fish (mostly larvae) (Jahncke <em>et al</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. At La Vieja Island, Peru, Peruvian anchovy <em>Engraulis ringens </em>(33.9%), the small krill <em>Euphausia mucronata</em> (26.8%) and squat lobster <em>Pleuroncodes monodon </em>(24.3%) were the most important prey species (GarcÃ­a-Godos and Goya 2006)<strong></strong>. High monthly variability in the main prey species suggests an opportunistic feeding behaviour associated with prey avaliability (GarcÃ­a-Godos and Goya 2006)<strong></strong>.     <p></p>","<p>El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation events are known to significantly alter the distribution of Peruvian Diving-petrel prey, reducing the diversity of prey items available to the diving-petrel (GarcÃ­a-Godos and Goya 2006), as well as altering weather patterns (M. de L. Brooke <em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999). Its philopatric nature may additionally suggest that rescue by migration is untenable, with the population thus vulnerable to ongoing anthropogenic pressures (Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Bycatch by artisanal fisheries represents a threat to the species, but previously speculated impact of the exploitation of anchovies throughout the species's range does not appear to be valid: the birds take smaller fish than targeted by the fishery and appear to respond far more strongly to sea surface temperature variation (GarcÃ­a-Godos and Goya 2006). However, within a 14-year period, c. 178 Peruvian Diving-petrels were found dead due to interactions with fisheries suggesting that competition with fisheries remain persistent (C. E. FernÃ¡ndez&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species can also be hunted for food on some islands (M. de L. Brooke <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Other human-driven threats include tourism, egg collection and light pollution (Simeone <em>et al</em>. 2003, Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Lack of adequate biosecurity measures (such as unmanaged visits to some breeding sites) also remains a potential threat due to potential introduction of invasive species (C. Wolf and N. Holmes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;</p><p></p>  <p>Invasive mammalian predators represent another threat. Peruvian Diving-petrels are thought to have been eradicated completely by foxes, <em>Pseudolopex</em> spp., in parts of the range and foxes have subsequently prevented recolonisation of these areas (Vilina 1992);&#160;ChaÃ±aral Island alone may have held over 100,000 pairs prior to fox introduction (A. Simeone&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Cats <em>Felis catus&#160;</em>and rats <em>Rattus </em>spp. are present on several islands within the species's range (Jahncke <em>et al</em>. 1999) and likely depredate adults and nests respectively. Fisherman may also chase rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cunniculus</em>) which could inadvertently destroy burrows (Simeone&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). House mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>)&#160;have moreover seen a rapid increase in recent years on Isla La Vieja (C. E. FernÃ¡ndez&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Dogs are present on San Gallan, where they may have played a significant role in reducing the resident population, however, this is a minority of the population (Jahncke <em>et al</em>. 1999). These invasive mammals may also prohibit re-colonisation of some islands (C. E. FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;</p>  <p>Mining for guano continues to happen every 5-7 years in La Vieja islands, but the population here has increased in recent decades suggesting that the current harvest regime is not impacting the species. Formerly destructive guano mining is thought to have been the main driver for large reductions in the population size and, if harvesting regimes become less sustainable, may again threaten the persistence of the species (M. de L. Brooke <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Two larger harbors are however planned to be built in the future to help with guano mining, likely to affect coastal foraging, nesting areas, and increased disturbance due to light (Cristofari <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","Based on colony observations, breeding populations are thought to occur in two main regions in Peru and Chile (C. Zavalaga&#160;<em>in litt</em>., Jahncke and Goya 1998, Valverde 2006, Guerra-Correa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, FernÃ¡ndez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, A Simeone&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Peru, 11,100 breeding pairs were observed on Isla La Vieja in 1995, 1,109 on Isla San GallÃ¡n in 1996, and 10 on Corcovado Island in 2005. In 2010, 36,450 pairs were recorded on Isla La Vieja alone, indicating a significant increase since the mid-90s (C. Zavalaga&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2010). There are an unknown number on GuaÃ±ape Sur (A. Simeone <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Chile, 8 breeding pairs were observed on FernÃ¡ndez Vial Island (date unknown), 432 on Pan de AzÃºcar Island in 2012 (although higher counts of 3,317 pairs were observed in 2009 here, such numbers are considered uncertain, with little explanation behind possible inflation in population size),&#160;97 on Isla Grande de Atacama in 2013 (with the small population residing here thought to form a population sink for migrant birds from neighbouring islands; Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019), 10,789-11,934 on Isla Choros during 2013-2014, and 40 on Isla PÃ¡jaros II in 2014 (FernÃ¡ndez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, A.

Zavalaga&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2010). This roughly equates to 52,500 pairs, rounded here to 50,000 pairs overall and converted to 100,000 mature individuals. The species's colonies are considered to be genetically isolated, with low migration rate due to its highly philopatric nature (Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, A. Simeone&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).",Increasing,"<em>Pelecanoides garnotii</em> formerly bred on offshore islands from Isla Lobos de Tierra, <strong>Peru</strong>, to Isla ChiloÃ©, <strong>Chile</strong>. It was numerous, e.g. there were c.100,000 pairs, and perhaps more, on Isla ChaÃ±aral, Chile, in 1938 (Vilina 1992), but the population has since declined significantly. Overall, the largest breeding colonies are attributed to the La Vieja-San&#160;GallÃ¡n islands in Peru and Choros islands in Chile, separated by 1,300 km (C. E. FernÃ¡ndez&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Peru, there were c.12,000-13,000 pairs on San GallÃ¡n and La Vieja Islands in 1995-1996 (Jahncke and Goya 1998)<strong></strong>. This is considerably higher than the c.1,500 individuals estimated in the early 1990s, probably because of improved information rather than an actual increase. In May-August 2010 a new survey of the La Vieja Islands documented 102,343 active nests (c.95% on La Vieja), of which 36,450 were occupied, indicating at least a three-fold increase in pairs since 1996, and possibly significantly more (C. Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2010). Two small colonies were found on Corcovado Island, Peru in 2005, extending the current breeding distribution c.700 km north of La Vieja, a main breeding centre (Valverde 2006)<strong></strong>.

Howell <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, and 300 nests were reported on Isla Choros in the late 1980s, which had increased to an estimated 1,550 active nests in 2001-2003 (<strong></strong>Simeone <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. However, high densities of nests were recorded on 4 islands north of Chile (ChaÃ±aral, Damas, Choros and Gaviota islands), with suggested densities of up to 1,400 individuals per hectare (Cruz-JofrÃ© and Vilina 2014).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>It has been recorded throughout the year near Isla ChaÃ±aral, and may still breed there or on small islands to the south (Vilina 1992)<strong></strong>.

Pan de AzÃºcar is declared a National Park, with a management plan granted in 2002, Choros is also a National Reserve with a management plan granted in 2009, whilst Grande de Atacama is a Coastal Marine Protected Area (FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2019). There have been searches for additional colonies in Chile (Vilina 1992)<strong></strong>. Strong biosecurity measures are in place on Choros and ChaÃ±aral Islands (due to the National Forest Corporation's [CONAF] management of the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve), albeit other breeding sites may be lacking in this (C.

The species avoids disturbance-prone areas. It forages amongst the lower branches of leafy trees, on rotting logs and on the forest floor by scratching at leaf litter. It feeds on seeds, fruits, insects and their larvae, and land molluscs (Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. It has a home range of at least 0.14 ha (<strong></strong>Bennun 1985)<strong></strong> in the non-breeding season, while in the breeding season in South Africa, densities are typically 1 pair/ha, and the defended territory of a breeding pair is 0.5-1 ha when feeding (Chittenden 2005).

The species does not conceal its nests well, and they tend to be very exposed and easy to find (Chittenden 2003, Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, leading to a low breeding success rate, with about 85% of nests recorded as failing by one observer in South Africa (Chittenden 2003)<strong></strong>. Nests may be re-used after a brood has fledged or even after the nest has been depredated, despite the clear indication that it is at risk. This may be a time- and energy-saving strategy (Chittenden 2003)<strong></strong>. Snakes, raptors and domestic cats are the main nest predators, and contribute to nearly 50% of breeding failures (Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Laying has been noted in November in Malawi (Dowsett-Lemaire and&#160;Dowsett, 2006) and in September-March in South Africa (Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005, Chittenden 2005)<strong></strong>. In 2019, this species was found breeding in Natal province by H. Chittenden (F. Dowsett-Lemaire, 2020, <em>pers. comm.</em>)<p></p>","In Tanzania, coastal forest patches are under heavy pressure and becoming increasingly fragmented. Pugu Forest is being degraded as a result of charcoal production (N. Burgess<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Wintering habitat in Kenya is also under heavy pressure, particularly the smaller sites (Waiyaki and Bennun 1999)<strong></strong>. In Malawi, the forest on Thyolo Mountain was completely destroyed c.2000 by illegal farming, and the small patch of forest on the adjacent Satemwa Tea Estate was cut down by the estate. The forest on Lisau Saddle had been destroyed by the 1990s by the Forestry Department, and the forest patch on Mount Soche was destroyed by illegal loggers shortly after the year 2000 (Dowsett-Lemaire <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; Dowsett-Lemaire &amp; Dowsett 2006; F. Dowsett-Lemaire 2020&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>).<br/><br/>At Mt Mulanje (Malawi) a&#160;large part of the forest on the southeastern slopes was destroyed by farmers, up to altitudes of 1,500 - 1,600m, but there remains a large block of forest on the upper southeastern slopes, and there is no encroachment into the Ruo Gorge on the southern slopes (F. Dowsett-Lemaire 2020&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>). At Mount Namuli, Mozambique, most of the forest has been destroyed in recent years (Dowsett-Lemaire 2010; Timberlake 2017). The forest at Mount Mabu is not seriously threatened at present (F. Dowsett-Lemaire, 2020, <em>pers. comm.</em>). In South Africa, mining has destroyed much wintering habitat and may affect more forest in the near future (T. B. Oatley <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, while habitat disturbance is increasing in many protected areas (Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>. The species's recovery is limited by its low breeding success, which is largely due to vulnerability of nests and resultant high rates of predation, perhaps exacerbated by domestic cats where they are present (Chittenden 2003, Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. This species occasionally suffers mortality from collisions with skyscrapers, probably due to the disorientating effect of city lights during nocturnal migration (Harebottle 1994 <em>unpublished</em>,&#160;Oatley 2007)<strong></strong>.

If the decline is found to be larger, the species would qualify for uplisting.","This species is found offshore and along sea coasts, mostly over the continental shelf to the edge, but also beyond into deep ocean. It feeds mostly on crustaceans throughout the year, supplemented by other invertebrates and small larval fish. The start of the breeding season varies greatly with latitude, from November in Baja California to possibly July in Alaska with laying typically timed to coincide with the spring zooplankton peaks (M. Hipfner <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The bird is known to double-brood, particularly in years characterised by high marine productivity (Johns <em>et al</em>. 2017). Birds form colonies from under 500 birds to over one million, usually at high densities on coastal islands with or without trees, and nesting on a wide range of habitats. It displays complex wintering patterns and whilst once thought to winter mainly offshore within the breeding range, with southerly populations being relatively sedentary compared to northern individuals which migrate south (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), the species is now known to exhibit temporally and spatially variable migration patterns on an interannual basis. Tracking of individuals from British Colombia, Canada, the largest population of <em>P. aleuticus</em>&#160;individuals, illustrates both north (summer, fall) and south (fall, winter) migrations with distributions ranging from B.C. to the Aleutian Islands and Baja California at distances of 2757 and 3110 km respectively (Studholme <em>et al</em>. 2019). Migration behaviour also appears to be flexible, varying year-on-year in response to changeable oceanographic and environmental conditions, although some fixed migratory behaviour appears apparent (Studholme <em>et al</em>. 2019).<p></p>","<p>Introduced predators represent the most serious threat to Cassinâs Auklet colonies (Nettleship 1996, Rodway and Lemon 2011). House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> were introduced on Langara in the early 20th century (first noted in 1946), followed by Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em> a few decades later (first noted in 1981) (Bertram and Nagorsen 1995). The auklet population on Langara and adjacent Cox and Lucy islands was extirpated by 1981 (Drent and Guiguet 1961, Rodway 1991) and only small numbers of auklets had recolonized Langara by 2004 (Regehr <em>et al.</em> 2007). Similarly, as House Rats invaded Anacapa, the local auklet population was completely or nearly extirpated between 1910 and 1975. After rat eradication, a total of 42 auklet nests in six discrete breeding areas were discovered between 2003 and 2012 (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2015). Recurring recolonization following rat eradication from the species's previous range indicate the substantial impact of rat predation on the species's distribution. Cats <em>Felis catus</em> were the likely driver of elimination or severe reductions, as it occurred in colonies from four Mexican islands (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Wolf<em> et al</em>. 2006). Raccoons <em>Procyon lotor </em>were introduced to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the early 1940s (which hold 18% of the world population of Cassin's Auklet), and two to four raccoons alone were responsible for up to 80% of observed predation on sub-adult and adult birds, while also depredating eggs and chicks (Hartman <em>et al. </em>1997). Mink and raccoons are considered responsible for the extirpation of the once large colonies on Lanx and Cox Islands, Scott Archipelago in the 1930s (Hipfner <em>et al</em>. 2010). Further range expansion by raccoons in this region may pose a significant conservation threat to the seabird populations on the islands (Hartman and Eastman 1999).</p>  <p>Red Foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes </em>occur naturally on some near-shore islands along the Alaska Peninsula and on the Fox Islands in the eastern Aleutians. Following the release of foxes on more than 450 previously fox-free Alaskan islands, populations of nesting birds were severely reduced through increased predation levels on eggs, nestlings and adult birds (Bailey and Kaiser 1993). Currently, fox predation pressure may be alleviating, due to their removal from 39 islands of more than 500,000 ha. Further eradications are being planned for at least four more islands (Veitch and Clout 2002).&#160;Light pollution may cause disorientation of auklets and prolong the period of effective predation. Exceptionally bright lights used in the squid jigging fishery close to breeding colonies lead to greatly increased predation by Barn Owls&#160;<em>Tyto alba&#160;</em>and possibly Western Gulls&#160;<em>Larus occidentalis</em>, and may also cause collision mortality and discourage adults from returning to shore (Harfenist 2004).</p>  <p>In addition to predation pressures, the species's habitat is threatened by introduced herbivores which destroy and degrade nesting habitat by trampling nests, browsing native vegetation and increasing erosion of topsoil. Goats <em>Capra hircus</em> introduced to Guadalupe Island in the 1800s intensively trampled and browsed the nesting habitat of the Guadalupe Storm-petrel <em>Oceanodroma macrodactyla</em>, likely contributing to the apparent extinction of the species (Wolf<em> et al.</em> 2006). Considering the Cassinâs Auklets similar burrowing nesting habit, it is also at risk from habitat destruction by goats. Likewise, rabbits have been considered a threat due to habitat conversion and competition with burrowing birds. However, Hipfner<em> et al. </em>(2010) found similar vegetation changes on Triangle Island which hosts rabbits and the neighbouring rabbit-free Sartine Island. Although the driving mechanism is uncertain, the decrease in Tufted Hairgrass <em>Deschampsia cespitosa </em>cover at the expense of Salmonberry <em>Rubus spectabilis </em>poses a serious risk to the species, restricting the area of suitable nesting habitat.</p>  <p>The species is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, particularly changes in sea temperature regimes and coastal upwelling systems (Wolf <em>et al. </em>2010). The frequency and magnitude of anomalous ocean conditions is expected to increase, threatening the long-term stability of some Cassinâs Auklet populations through decreased availability of krill and associated mortality and low recruitment; this particularly impacts auklets throughout the southern portion of its range, and those that winter in California, for whom krill comprises a major prey (Bertram <em>et al</em>. 2001, Hipfner 2008). Similarly. on Triangle Island, British Colombia, Canada, nesting success has been evidenced to be lower in warm-water years due to both the reduced abundance and, more importantly, earlier disappearance of the prey copepod&#160;<em>Neocalanus cristatus</em>.&#160;<em>N. cristatus</em>&#160;disappearance occurred on average 2-3 weeks earlier in warm-water years, reducing Auklet survival to, and weight at, fledging, thereby highlighting the significant impact of not just prey abundance, but also prey timing on predator survival as ocean conditions continue to warm (Hipfner 2008). Low breeding success has been documented in strong El NiÃ±o years (e.g., 1983, 1992, and 1997) (Manugian <em>et al. </em>2015). During a 15-year study period (1994â2008), two extreme climate events (a strong El NiÃ±o event in 1997â1998 and an atmospheric blocking event in 2005) were both associated with a halving of the adult survival of female Cassin's Auklets (Morrison<em> et al. </em>2011). Auklets have shown ability to respond adaptively to variation in oceanographic conditions and prey availability by modifying timing of breeding; however, in years when ocean conditions deteriorated after the initiation of breeding, prey availability was severely reduced beyond the birdsâ potential for an adaptive response, resulting in diminished nestling growth and productivity (Abraham and Sydeman 2004, Manugian <em>et al</em>. 2015). Negative effects of climatic variation on both reproductive success and the survival of adult females is thought to be driving the ongoing decline in the Cassin's Auklet population on Triangle Island (Morrison<em> et al.</em> 2011). Likewise, the fluctuations in the northern Californian populations may be partially explained by anomalous warm-water conditions (Nettleship 1996), which are also thought to be responsible for the mass die-off of over 100,000 individuals reported from California to central British Columbia and Alaska through 2014 into January 2015 (Welch 2015, Devitt and Jardine 2016, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>Oil pollution represents a significant threat and extractive operations may impact negatively on the species through increased pollution and collision with lights (Harfenist 2004). Past oil spills are known to have impacted the species. For example, in the 1986 Apex Houston oil spill, an estimated total of 10,577 birds were debilitated or killed (Page and Carter 1986, Page <em>et al. </em>1990), including 'a smaller number' of Cassin's Auklets (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2003). Sub-lethal doses of petroleum have been found to reduce reproductive success in the species (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1981). The species is also known to be exposed to varying degrees of plastic pollution although it is not yet clear whether exposure to such pollution is of significant impact to the species (Floren and Shugart 2017, O'Hara <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>  <p>Declines have also been attributed to increases in numbers of native predators, including Bald Eagle <em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em>, Peregrine Falcon <em>Falco peregrinus </em>and Western Gull <em>Larus occidentalis </em>in some areas (Nettleship 1996). The Cassinâs Auklet was among the most common prey found in a Bald Eagle nest in California (23 out of 297 birds were of this species) (Erlandsson <em>et al. </em>2007). Reports also include heavy predation by Western Gulls (Thoresen 1964, Manuwal 1979, Nelson 1989) and Peregrine Falcons, particularly on Triange Island where Auklets comprise the Peregrine's primary prey (Hipfner <em>et al</em>. 2011, M. Hipfner <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The seabird tick <em>Ixodes uriae</em>&#160;is also known to parasitise the species however, its influence appears minimal and doesn't seem influence <em>P. aleuticus</em>&#160;survival to fledging (Hipfner <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>  <p>Human disturbance may also be contributing to reduced reproductive success in parts of the range. Birds whose burrows were closer to foodpaths or villages had a higher rate of nest abandonment and lower breeding success compared to birds nesting further away from settlements and passageways (Albores-Barajas and Soldatini 2011). Although chicks did not show any effect of disturbance in the early stages of growth, chicks in the experimentally disturbed groups stopped gaining weight sooner than undisturbed controls and fledged at lower weights (6 to 9% less) (Albores-Barajas <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p>  <p>Bycatch mortality of the species was recorded in the pelagic salmon driftnet fishery in the 1970s and 1980s (Ainley <em>et al. </em>1981) and off British Columbia between 1995 and 2001 (Smith and Morgan 2005), but reduced fishing effort and greater fisheries restrictions have resulted in significant reductions in bycatch of Marbled Murrelet <em>Brachyramphus marmoratus </em>(caught in similar numbers to Cassin's Auklet in previous studies), and is no longer considered a driver of significant decline in that species (Zydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013). As such, it is unlikely that bycatch is impacting the Cassin's Auklet population at greater than a negligible rate.</p>","The total population is estimated to be at least 3,600,000 breeding birds (Nettleship 1996), which equates to approximately 5,400,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species ranges from Baja California (<strong>Mexico</strong>) up the Pacific coast of the <strong>U.S.A.</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong>, through Alaska to the Aleutian Islands (U.S.A.)

The use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of beaked whales, including mesoplodonts (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause of the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness due to a behavioral response to sound sources (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005). </p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017).

The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. DD was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: âIf the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.â Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and across a substantial swath of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere and is not rare, therefore the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied. Therefore, it was concluded that the species does not belong in the DD category.</p>  <p>There is little information on abundance or trends in abundance for this species but regular although infrequent sightings suggest it is uncommon. Typical threats that may result in declines in abundance, namely anthropogenic noise and fisheries bycatch, are not prevalent in most of the range of this species, making LC the more plausible category.</p>","<p>This species generally occurs in deep, cold temperate and subpolar waters, especially in areas with steep-bottomed slopes beyond the continental shelf edge (Kasuya 2009). However, some sightings have been associated with shallower regions, coastal waters, continental slopes or seamounts (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Hobson and Martin (1996) observed groups of Arnouxâs Beaked Whales near the Antarctic Peninsula and found that their breath-holding capabilities make this species one of the most accomplished mammalian divers, capable of swimming up to an estimated 7 km between breathing sites in sea ice. The species seems well-adapted to life in ice-covered waters and may be able to exploit food resources inaccessible to other predators in the region (Ponganis <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/> <br/> Little is known of the feeding habits of Arnoux's Beaked Whales but they are assumed to be similar to those of their Northern Hemisphere relatives, Baird's Beaked Whales, with primary prey species consisting of benthic and pelagic fishes and cephalopods (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Culik 2004). Therefore, Brownell and Ainley (2009) suggested that Antarctic toothfish and the most-caught by-catch species, macrourids, in the Area 88 fishery are likely important components in their diet.</p>","<p>Arnouxâs Beaked Whale has never been hunted to any significant degree, and direct anthropogenic threats are not known. However, a few whales have been taken for scientific study (see Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Considering that some beaked whale species are known to be vulnerable to large-mesh pelagic driftnets (e.g. Californian drift-netting for swordfish and sharks (Barlow and Cameron 2003), it is likely that Arnouxâs Beaked Whales were caught in the large-scale drift-netting in the Tasman sea. Although current levels of bycatch are unknown, they are likely to be low due to adoption in 1989 of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly, which called for effective conservation and management measures of living marine resources in areas of high seas drift-netting. Developing high-latitude fisheries, such as that for Antarctic toothfish, a significant proportion of which is illegal and unregulated, have the potential to reduce food available for large predators.<br/> <br/> In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, DâAmico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, FernÃ¡ndez <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;However, this speciesâ range probably puts it largely outside the major areas of such impacts.</p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of beaked whales (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and is a potential health hazard of unknown significance. However, in all reported cases, organochlorine residues found in Southern Hemisphere small cetacean are lower than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (OâShea <em>et al. </em>1980, Reijnders <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/> <br/> Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species, although the nature and magnitude of these impacts is unknown at this time (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>","<p>There are no global abundance estimates available for this species (Kasuya 2009), but in comparison with the sympatric Southern Bottlenose Whale (<em>Hyperoodon planifrons</em>), Arnouxâs Beaked Whale is considered relatively uncommon. </p>  Kasamatsu and Joyce (1995) estimated there to be 599,300 (CV=15%) beaked whales south of the Antarctic Convergence in January, and most of these were considered to be southern bottlenose whales. Branch &amp; Butterworth (2001), on the other hand, estimated 72,000 and 54,000 such whales on the basis of the second and third circumpolar IWC cetacean surveys, respectively. The estimates by these two sets of authors differ by what correction factor was used to address the âsightabilityâ of the whales. The ratio of Arnouxâs beaked whales to southern bottlenose whales in these surveys was 18:1040. Therefore, the estimate for Arnouxâs beaked whales would be 5000 and 3000, respectively (Brownell and Ainley 2009). However, neither estimate accounts for Arnouxâs beaked whales in sea-ice covered areas where they have been frequently observed.&#160;  <p>Arnoux's Beaked Whales seem to be relatively abundant in southern New Zealand around Doubtful Sound and in Cook Strait, at least during summer, and occasionally around Tasmania.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Arnoux's Beaked Whales are found in a circumpolar pattern in the southern Hemisphere from the Antarctic continent and ice edges (ca. 78Â°S) north to about 34Â°S in the South Pacific (Kasuya 2009). They may even reach as far north as 24Â°S in the South Atlantic off Brazil. Sightings are regularly reported such that the species can be considered uncommon but nowhere within this range are they very well known or considered common. Most of the reported sightings are from the Doubtful Sound, New Zealand; Tasman Sea and around the Albatross Cordillera in the South Pacific (MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006). There are also sightings close to the Antarctic coast (Brownell 1974, Ponganis <em>et al.</em> 1995, Hobson and Martin, 1996), Friedlander <em>et al.</em> 2009). The overwhelming majority of strandings have been from around New Zealand (Balcomb 1989, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993).

All Common Dolphins are now classified as <em>Delphinus delphis</em> and are covered in this updated Red List assessment. &#160;</p>  <p>Common Dolphins are widely distributed from tropical to cool temperate waters of both hemispheres in all major ocean basins. They occur in a range of habitats from nearshore to offshore waters. They are one of the most widespread and abundant cetacean species globally. Available estimates indicate that there are well over 6 million individuals, and actual abundance is probably considerably higher, as many areas within the species range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, have never been surveyed.</p>  <p>Common Dolphins are often bycaught in fishing gear throughout their range and several populations are of conservation concern, including the Black Sea subspecies, which is classified as Vulnerable (Birkun 2008), the Mediterranean subpopulation, which is Endangered (Bearzi 2003, Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2020b), and the Gulf of Corinth subpopulation in Greece, which is Critically Endangered (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Other factors that likely affect the conservation status of Common Dolphins in some areas include prey depletion caused by overfishing, underwater noise, contamination by xenobiotics and global climate disruption. Despite this, the species remains one of the most widespread and abundant cetaceans and, although several local populations have declined dramatically, much of the range is in less impacted parts of the ocean, and there is no evidence that the threats are resulting in a global population decline. <em>Delphinus delphis</em> was listed (under the older taxonomic concept, excluding <em>D. capensis</em>) as Least Concern in 2008; it remains Least Concern in this updated assessment.</p>","<p>Common Dolphins inhabit tropical and warm-temperate waters of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In the Indo-Pacific, they are found mostly in continental shelf waters, and generally do not occur around oceanic islands far from mainland coasts (Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2002). Elsewhere, Common Dolphins have been reported to prefer upwelling-modified waters, areas with steep sea-floor relief, and shelf areas (Evans 1994). </p>  <p>In the Mediterranean and in European waters generally, Common Dolphins inhabit both coastal (neritic) and offshore (pelagic) waters, but they seem to prefer continental shelf waters and areas of high productivity, such as upwelling regions (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2003, Saavedra <em>et al.</em> in press). In the Black Sea, Common Dolphins occur in both continental shelf and pelagic waters (Birkun 2008, Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2019). </p>  <p>The short-beaked form of common dolphins in the eastern central Pacific (<em>Delphinus delphis delphis</em>) extends far off the continental shelf in temperate waters with a distinct break in tropical equatorial waters.&#160; The long-beaked form (<em>Delphinus delphis bairdii</em>) &#160;in the same regions is strictly found in waters inshore of the shelf break (Hamilton<em> et al. </em>2009). Associations with other marine mammal species are common. Mixed-species groups of Common and Striped Dolphins (<em>Stenella coeruleoalba</em>) are observed frequently in Mediterranean and European waters (Saavedra <em>et al</em>. In press). Common Dolphins also sometimes associate with Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala</em> spp.) and a number of other small delphinids (Evans 1994, QuÃ©rouil <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; Common Dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) are sometimes associated with Yellowfin Tuna (<em>Thunnus albacares)</em> and have thus been captured in tuna purse seines (Gerrodette 2018).</p>  <p>Common Dolphins are highly social animals that live in groups ranging from a few tens to several thousands of individuals (Perrin 2018, Saavedra <em>et al.</em> in press). Their prey normally consists of epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes and a smaller proportion of squids. Prey can include gadids, small scombroids, clupeoids and both loliginid and ommastrephid squids (Perrin 2018, Saavedra <em>et al</em>. in press). Diet studies suggest both opportunism and specialization (e.g. Santos <em>et al.</em> 2013), with a preference overall for energy-rich prey (Meynier <em>et al.</em> 2008, Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2010). </p>","Common Dolphins are one of the most widespread, abundant and well-studied cetacean species.&#160; As such there is a lot of information regarding threats, which is summarized below.&#160; Despite this, much of the range includes remote, oceanic waters where threats are likely to be relatively low. <br/><br/><u><strong>Bycatch</strong></u><br/>Globally, Common Dolphins are sometimes bycaught in fishing gear, including in purse seines, drifting and set gillnets, trawl nets, and longlines. In the Eastern Tropical Pacific, they are sometimes found in association with Yellowfin Tuna and the annual incidental mortality of Common Dolphins in the tuna purse-seine fishery was estimated to be as high as 24,000 in 1986 (IATTC 2017). After the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) imposed per-vessel catch limits on the international fleet, the mortality estimate of Common Dolphins declined to 127 in 2016 (IATTC 2017). Catches of Common Dolphins have also been recorded in purse-seine fisheries in the Indian Ocean and off the west coast of Africa (Anderson et al. 2020, Simmons 1968). Tuna driftnet fisheries in the Indian Ocean are estimated to have killed a total of 4.1 million small cetaceans between 1950-2018, an unknown proportion of which would have been Common Dolphins (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2020). Common Dolphins were the most frequently reported cetaceans taken in the U.S. driftnet fishery for sharks and swordfish, with about 2,100 estimated killed between 1990 and 2002 (Julian and Beeson 1998, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2005); measures taken since 1996 to reduce the cetacean bycatch in this fishery have been largely effective, and it is no longer a population-level concern for Common Dolphins (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>In the western Atlantic, average annual estimated fishery-related mortality of Common Dolphins during 2013â2017 was 419 individuals (CV=0.10), with the highest mortality occurring in the US mid-Atlantic bottom trawl fishery (Hayes et al. 2020). By-catches have also been reported from other areas and likely occur in most parts of the speciesâ range (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2000, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2003, Saavedra et al. in press, Zerbini and Kotas 1998).<br/><br/>Incidental mortality in fishing gear, especially driftnets, has undoubtedly contributed to the decline of Common Dolphins in the Mediterranean (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2003). Driftnets were reported to kill a few hundred Common Dolphins per year in the AlborÃ n Sea alone during the early 1990s (Silvani <em>et al</em>. 1999). In EU waters, driftnets have been prohibited since 2002, but they are still being used illegally in much of the Mediterranean region.<br/><br/><u><strong>Directed Takes</strong></u><br/>In the Black Sea large numbers of cetaceans were taken in directed hunts in the past. The total number of animals killed is not known, but it was estimated that before the mid 1950s Common Dolphins comprised 95% of the total number of Black Sea cetaceans killed in the former Soviet Union (Tzalkin 1940, Kleinenberg 1956). Based on this value, it was calculated that during the last five years of the cetacean hunt in the USSR and Bulgaria (1962â1966), these two countries landed over 121,000 Common Dolphins, while during the preceding 31 years (1931-61) another 1.5 million had been landed mainly by the USSR (Zemsky 1996). Between 1976 and 1981, <em>D. d. ponticus</em> was believed to account for 15â16% (or 37,500â40,000 individuals) of the Turkish catch, estimated for that period as 250,000 animals of all three species (IWC 1983, Birkun 2008). Directed takes of Common Dolphins for human consumption and shark bait are still a threat in Peru (Mintzer <em>et al</em>. 2018). In the 1990s many Common Dolphins were killed by harpooning around Margarita Island, off eastern Venezuela (Romero <em>et al</em>. 2001); it is not clear if such killing continues. The annual catch of Common Dolphins in the dolphin hunt in Japan in the early 1970s was over 8,000 individuals, peaking at 9,032 in 1973 (Kasuya 2017). The catch levels declined slowly, so that through most of the 1980s and early 1990s annual mortality was down to several hundred, and since 1993 it has been less than 10 animals (Kasuya 2017). Common Dolphins were (and may still be) taken in small numbers in the directed cetacean hunt in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/><u><strong>Prey Depletion</strong></u><br/>Reduced prey availability resulting from overfishing was considered one of the primary causes of the regional decline of Common Dolphins in the Gulf of Vera, Spain (CaÃ±adas and Hammond 2008), in the Gulf of Naples, Italy (Mussi <em>et al</em>. 2019), and in the Ionian Sea Archipelago, Greece (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2006, Piroddi <em>et al</em>. 2011). Of two mass mortality events that killed several hundred Black Sea Common Dolphins in 1990 and 1994 (Krivokhizhin and Birkun 1999), the latter was the result of a morbillivirus epizootic. However, both die-offs coincided with a drastic (8- to 12-fold) decline in the abundance of the two main Common Dolphin prey species, anchovy and sprat, and reduced prey availability is considered to be a major threat to Black Sea Common Dolphins (Bushuyev 2000). The correlation between large die-offs and prey scarcity suggests that the undernourishment has increased the dolphinsâ susceptibility to viral infections in that area (Birkun 2008).<br/><br/><u><strong>Other Threats</strong></u><br/>In European waters, Common Dolphins carry levels of PCBs that appear to be lower than those of other cetacean species (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2016), but health issues likely due to PCBs are nonetheless observable. For instance, high concentrations of PCBs in Common Dolphins from the NE Atlantic were related to reproductive failure (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among some cetaceans and may also threaten Common Dolphins (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The stomachs of 35 Common Dolphins stranded in Galicia, NW Spain, all contained microplastics (HernÃ¡ndez-Gonzalez <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Noise produced by naval vessels and helicopters during a military exercise was considered the most probable cause of a mass stranding in the United Kingdom in 2008, involving at least 26 Common Dolphins (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2013).","This is a widespread species and the available abundance estimates are primarily from the Northern Hemisphere. There are very few abundance estimates from the Southern Hemisphere, which constitutes a large portion of the species range. Studies of Common Dolphin abundance in each ocean basin or sea are summarized (but not exhaustively) below.<br/><br/><u><strong>Pacific Ocean</strong></u><br/>The abundance of Common Dolphins in the eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) was estimated from eight vessel-based line-transect surveys conducted between 1986 and 2000 as 2,963,000 (CV=24%) (Gerrodette and Forcada 2002). In 2006, Common Dolphins were again judged to be the most abundant cetaceans in the ETP and were estimated at 3,127,203 (CV=26%) individuals (Gerrodette <em>et al</em>. 2008). The most recent estimate of abundance off California, Oregon and Washington, determined from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line transect surveys was 969,861 (CV = 0.17) Short-beaked Common Dolphins, and 101,305 (CV=0.49) Eastern North Pacific Long-beaked Common Dolphins (Barlow 2016). These estimates include correction factors for animals missed during the surveys (Barlow 2016).<br/><br/>There are an estimated 1.4 million Common Dolphins in the Western Pacific off Japan (Kanaji <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Ship survey data from 2009 resulted in an estimated total of 279,000 dolphins of the <em>Delphinus delphis bairdii </em>subspecies along the west coast of Baja California and the California coast (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2011). A total of just over 12,000 Common Dolphins (<em>Delphinus delphis delphis</em>) was estimated in the EEZ of Colombia based on surveys conducted between 1986 and 2008 (Gerrodette and Palacios 1996).<br/><br/><u><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong></u><br/>The best estimate of abundance in the western North Atlantic is 172,825 (CV=0.21) based on Canadian and U.S. surveys conducted in 2016 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2020). Abundance in European continental shelf and offshore waters (not including the Mediterranean and Black seas) was estimated as 467,000 (CV=0.26) dolphins based on aerial and vessel surveys in 2016; the majority of sightings were in the Bay of Biscay and coastal waters of France and Spain (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some 62,000 Common Dolphins were estimated to be present in 1993 west of the Bay of Biscay, in the area of the albacore tuna driftnet fishery (Goujon 1996).<br/><br/><u><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></u><br/>Once one of the most common species in this region, Common Dolphins have experienced a generalized and major decline since the 1970s (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2003). In 2018, aerial surveys covering a large part of the region indicated low abundance across most of the Mediterranean subpopulation's range, and an absence or near absence of Common Dolphins within areas known to have hosted large numbers historically. The sum of mean estimates for the inner Mediterranean strata (Mediterranean minus the AlborÃ n Sea) was 5,200 Common Dolphins (95% CI 1890-14305; ASI 2020; Bearzi et al. 2020b). The Common Dolphin subpopulation in the Mediterranean region is listed as Endangered (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/><u><strong>Water bodies within the Mediterranean Sea</strong></u><br/>Common Dolphins have almost completely vanished from the Adriatic Sea, where they used to be abundant (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2004, Genov <em>et al</em>. 2020). In the Gulf of Vera, Balearic Sea, Common Dolphin numbers decreased threefold from 1992â1995 to 1996â2004 (CaÃ±adas and Hammond 2008). Dramatic negative trends in abundance were recorded in the eastern Ionian Sea (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2006). Only a few individuals survive in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Corinth, Greece (Frantzis and Herzing 2002, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2016), where the subpopulation has been assessed as Critically Endangered (Santostasi <em>et al</em>. 2018, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/><u><strong>Black Sea</strong></u><br/>According to Birkun (2008), there may be at least several tens of thousands and possibly more than 100,000 Common Dolphins in the Black Sea. This population was, however, heavily hunted for centuries: over 160,000 animals were killed between 1962 and 1983, likely resulting in a significant population decline Birkun (2008). Aerial surveys carried out in 2019 in southern and western Black Sea waters resulted in 716 sightings of Common Dolphins involving 1751 individuals (Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2019). Abundance estimates from these surveys are not yet available.<br/><br/><u><strong>Indian Ocean</strong></u><br/>No estimates exist for the northern Indian Ocean, and there are only a few for small areas of the southern Indian Ocean/Indo-Pacific. About 15,000â20,000 Common Dolphins were estimated to occur off South Africa (Cockcroft and Peddemors 1990), and approximately 21,000 were estimated for a localised region off southern Australia (Bilgmann <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/><u><strong>Global totals</strong></u><br/>Taken together, the above estimates suggest a total of several million Common Dolphin worldwide. Considering that large portions of the speciesâ range have not been surveyed, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, the actual abundance is certainly higher than the sum of the estimates for the surveyed areas.",Unknown,"<p>The Common Dolphin is a widely distributed oceanic species that occurs from tropical to cool temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans (Perrin 2018). Within the Atlantic Ocean, it appears to be absent from the Gulf of Mexico and from of the Caribbean Sea (except for the region around Venezuela, where a coastal population occurs; Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2009). It occurs in a range of habitat types, including nearshore waters as well as open-sea waters thousands of kilometres offshore. Common Dolphins regularly occur in some enclosed seas, such as the Okhotsk Sea and Sea of Japan, and separate subpopulations exist in the Mediterranean Sea and a subspecies in the Black Sea. Once one of the most common cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea, the Common Dolphins there have undergone a generalized and major reduction in geographic range since the 1970s (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2003). Common Dolphins occur as far south as southeastern South Africa and Namibia in Africa; southern Australia and New Zealand; and Argentina and northern Chile (Finday <em>et al</em>. 1992, Durante <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Northern Hemisphere they extend to the UK, Norway, Korea, Japan and Canada (Caputo <em>et al</em>. 2017, Song <em>et al</em>. 2014, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Common Dolphins occur regularly in the Persian Gulf (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2010, Preen 2004) and in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p>Distributions of the four currently recognized subspecies of Common Dolphins are as follows:</p>  <ul><li><em>Delphinus delphis delphis</em>: the nominate subspecies occurs throughout the entire range of the species, except the Black Sea and Indian Ocean.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Delphinus delphis bairdii</em>: this subspecies appears to be found in distinct areas and apparently-disjunct subpopulations are known from central California to southern Mexico, and possibly Peru.

Commercial hunting for human food has occurred for many years in Japan (Kasuya 2017) and this species is used as bait in some Indo-Pacific, South American, and Caribbean&#160; fisheries (Romero <em>et al.</em> 1997, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1997).</p>",Marine,"<p>Common Dolphins, along with other cetaceans, are legally protected in many countries although the extent of protection and degree of enforcement varies. The IATTC has imposed annual bycatch limits on each purse seiner and has promulgated regulations regarding the safe release of dolphins impacted by the ETP tuna purse seine fishery (Bayliff 2001). In the eastern North Pacific, the U.S. driftnet fishery has been required to use acoustic warning devices (pingers) since 1996 to reduce cetacean bycatch.</p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The population trend is stable overall with localised decreases in population size, usually driven by human disturbance and climatic variability. Increasing ocean temperature and strong winds are linked to negative effects on adult foraging and chick survival. The stable trend should be taken cautiously as 60% of the sites have an âunknownâ population trends due to data deficiency. In Australia, there is a decrease in the population size in New South Wales and South Australia while Tasmania is data deficient. Populations are stable in WA and increasing in Victoria. In New Zealand, the situation of the species remains unclear due to inconsistent monitoring efforts over large parts of the country. Little penguins along the South Islandâs West Coast, Banks Peninsula seem to be decreasing over the past decades while penguin numbers around Oamaru are stable if not increasing. Although the species has a large estimated extent of occurrence, about 69% of sites have fewer than 100 breeding individuals. For the remaining sites, 28% have between 100 and 5000 individuals and only 3% of sites have a population size above 5,000 individuals. Sites with small populations are more vulnerable with reported local extinctions. Several sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease in population size, while many former breeding colonies no longer exist. The population range and size do not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable criteria (extent of occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and &lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p>","<p>The little penguin (<em>Eudyptula minor</em>), the smallest of all penguins (~30-40 cm), is endemic to southern Australia and New Zealand, breeding during the austral autumn to summer months. These dark indigo-blue coloured penguins are the only genuinely nocturnal penguin species on land; adults always arrive after dusk and leave before dawn (Klomp &amp; Wooller 1991, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2007, RodrÃ­guez <em>et al. </em>2016). The global population is estimated as 469,760 individuals. The little penguin population trend is stable overall with localised decrease in some sites. This species is a generalist feeder with significant variability in diet between colonies and even between years at the same colony (Klomp and Wooller 1988, Gales &amp; Pemberton 1990, Cullen <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fraser and Lalas 2004, Chiaradia<em> et al.</em> 2010, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2016). They feed mainly on clupeids such as anchovy <em>Engraulis</em> sp and sardines <em>Sardinops sagax </em>when feeding chicks but they may also feed on krill <em>Nyctiphanes australis </em>and several species of cephalopods at all stages of breeding (Gales &amp; Pemberton 1990, Cullen <em>et al.</em> 1992, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2016) and jellyfish (Cavallo <em>et al.</em> 2018). This variability in the diet is also found in their trophic interactions where penguins can reduce the prey trophic range in response to years of low breeding success (Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2010) and segregate foraging areas within the same colony (SÃ¡nchez <em>et al. </em>2018). The species dives to a maximum 72 metres, with a preferred depth zone between 20 to 30 metres (Chiaradia <em>et al. </em>2007, Ropert-Coudert <em>et al. </em>2009)</p><p>Penguins typically lay two eggs per clutch (Stahel <em>et al. </em>1987), and up to three clutches over a breeding season (Johannesen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The penguins exhibit six main breeding stages: courtship, pre-laying exodus, pre-laying, incubation, guard and post-guard (Chiaradia &amp; Kerry 1999); followed by moulting and inter-breeding stages (Salton <em>et al.</em> 2015). When feeding chicks, some parents make more foraging trips than their mates. This situation represents the norm (72% of cases), rather than the previously expected equal parenting (Saraux<em> et al.</em> 2011). Individuals can also alternate between two consecutive long foraging trips and several shorter ones throughout the chick-rearing period (Saraux<em> et al. </em>2011). Short trips allow for regular food provisioning of chicks (high feeding frequency and larger meals), whereas longer trips are triggered by a parentâs low body mass and therefore the need to replenish its energy reserves. Little penguins form groups when crossing the beach to nesting sites and individuals seem to choose their travelling partners (Daniel<em> et al. </em>2007). When foraging,&#160; some individuals can take advantage of human-made features, like ship channels to aid in their foraging (Preston <em>et al.</em> 2008). Breeding age, ranging from 2 to 18+ years, seems to play a crucial role as well, as middle-aged (8-12 years) penguins are better breeders (Nisbet &amp; Dann 2009), employ more effective foraging strategies (Zimmer <em>et al. </em>2011) and feed in different locations (Pelletier<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p><p></p>","<p>Many populations of little penguins are severely threatened by human disturbance such as introduced predators, domestic dogs, roadkill, coastal development, watercraft injuries, oil spills and gillnet fishing in both Australia and New Zealand (Cannel <em>et al.</em> 2016; Chiaradia 2013, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017, Dann 2013). Reduction in prey abundance is another major vulnerability to little penguin populations (Cannel <em>et al. </em>2016; Chiaradia 2013) as well as natural predators such as fur seals and corvids (Ekanayake at al. 2015a,b). Changes in the abundance of major prey can result in a dramatic change in their diet composition and trophic interactions, resulting in increased mortality and decreased breeding success (Dann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>A newer and additional challenge for this species is in the fast-changing marine and terrestrial environment, particularly in the rapidly warming sea of south-eastern Australia (Ramirez <em>et al.</em> 2017, Voice <em>et al.</em> 2006; Wu<em> et al. </em>2012), wherein southwestern Australia the warming sea has been associated with poorer breeding (Cannell <em>et al. </em>2012). Penguins have also been shown to catch less prey under warmer conditions (Carroll <em>et al. </em>2016). Oceanographic change may lead to a mismatch between plankton and the small pelagic fish that are also penguin prey (Hinder<em> et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Increasing terrestrial temperatures in the spring and summer months can cause fatal hyperthermia in both chicks and adults (Cannell <em>et al.</em> 2011, Cannell <em>et al. </em>2012, Cannell <em>et al.</em> 2016). This issue is particularly relevant in those colonies where nesting occurs within the vegetation rather than in burrows as a result of a soft, sandy substrate. <br/><br/>Remarkably, some of these pressures can be locally offset by a wide range of conservation efforts, such as the case of increasing population size at Phillip Island (Sutherland &amp; Dann 2012, 2014), St Kilda (Preston <em>et al.</em> 2010; Preston 2011), Manly (Carlile<em> et al. </em>2015), Oamaru (Agnew <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160; Sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease, where many known breeding colonies no longer exist (Dann 1994; Stevenson &amp; Woehler 2007, Wilson &amp; Mattern 2019). Local extinction of many small colonies continues in Australia and New Zealand.</p>","<p>The global population size has been quantified for most sites, with the current population estimate of 469,760 breeding adults. This population size is smaller than the previously estimate, where the total population was only considered as under 1,000,000 individuals, but was based on non-quantified data. With quantified data, there is an increase of 18% in population size when historic and recent data are compared. However, this increase should be interpreted with caution as it is very likely to be related to improved population survey effort rather than an actual increase in population. For sites with current population estimates, 60% of the sites have an âunknownâ trend due to data deficiency. Nevertheless, for the sites where data were available, 51% of sites were stable, 29% deteriorating and 20% improving.

Riau experienced the highest rate of deforestation in Sumatra and 63% of the natural forest have been lost between 1985 and 2008 (Uryu <em>et al</em>. 2010). Additionally, forest fires linked to the ENSO events, and open burning of forest land for agricultural purposes destroy millions of hectares of land in Indonesia on an annual basis, and Riau is often one of the worst impacted areas, owing in part to its high concentration of peatland (World Bank 2016). The scattered forest remnants and agroforests where <em>P. percura </em>were found might no longer remain without conservation actions on the ground.

Plantations of fast-growing rubber were first introduced in Jambi, Sumatra in 1904 and subsequently expanded rapidly as a cash crop in the eastern coast from the 1920s (Stoler 1995). Today, rubber plantations in Sumatra continue to grow in the forms of rubber forest and rubber monoculture.

Primates are regularly offered for sale in the Jalan Durian bird market in Pekanbaru; while <em>Presbytis </em>langurs do not make good pets, a small number of <em>P. percura </em>may have been offered for sale. As of August 2020, there was an individual of the species in the Kalaweit Rehabilitation Center in Sumatra, after being taken in as a former pet.<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Remaining populations are scattered in highly fragmented habitats, including near croplands within urban areas. There is an urgent need to locate viable populations and designate key conservation areas for this critically endangered species. More data on the population trends, ecology, and population genetics are urgently needed. There is also a need to raise awareness about this species in order to generate public and government interest.<br/><br/>The distribution of <em>P. percura </em>requires clarification. It is known to occur in Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu Biosphere Reserve in Sumatra, Indonesia through camera trap surveys (Fujita <em>et al</em>. 2012), but no other information is available.<br/><br/>The species is protected under the name Presbytis melalophos in Indonesiaâs 2018 protected species list. No harvest quota has been allocated for any of the <em>Presbytis </em>species for at least since 2000 and no animals are allowed to be taken from the wild for commercial purposes.<br/><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

There are no population estimates (neither recent nor in the past), but some of the speciesâ habitat continues to be converted for agriculture (primarily oil palm) and it is also targeted by the illegal pet trade. Over the past twenty years, some of the regions within the species' extent of occurrence have lost 25% of their forest cover (Global Forest Watch 2021); given that this species' generation time is <em>ca</em> 10-12 years, it is not unreasonable to suspect a population decline over thirty years that approaches 30% due to a combination of habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation (exacerbated by hunting and live extraction for the pet trade). As such, this species is considered to be Near Threatened.","<p><em>Presbytis robinsoni </em>is found in primary and secondary lowland rainforest, including the lower elevations of hilly evergreen forests. Little information is available on its ecology and behavior (e.g. Md-Zain <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/></p>","<p>Deforestation, habitat conversion, and fragmentation continue to be the major threats to this species. It is particularly affected by oil palm plantations, which are expanding very rapidly within its range. Little is known about its population size and overall conservation needs as there are limited studies on the species.
