It tends to be associated with sponge and gorgonian-dominated habitats on the North West Shelf (Sainsbury 1987), and hard mud areas of the Arafura Sea. In Australia, it frequently forms mixed shoals with <em>Lutjanus erythropterus</em>. Juveniles tend to inhabit shallow inshore waters and seagrass beds and larger fish live in deeper waters (McPherson <em>et al.</em> 1988). Maximum total length is 100 cm (Allen 1985).

Based on the denuded landscape caused by non-native goats, historic human consumption, and low numbers of iguanas observed in the 1960s–1970s, it is estimated that the iguana population had been reduced by at least 50% up to a point three generations in the past (52 years) and probably continued until after the goats were eradicated in 1972. The most recent survey in 2005 estimated their population to be 3,500–4,000 mature adults and potentially stable, although it was unknown if they had neared carrying capacity. Molecular analysis also shows extremely low genetic variation and richness compared to sampled populations of the Common Land Iguana (<em>Conolophus subcristatus</em>). Heavy predation pressure on this congregatory nesting iguana by Galápagos Hawks may have affected the rate of population recovery since goats were eradicated (1972). The recent introduction to the island of &gt;500 juvenile Española Tortoises that compete with iguanas for scarce food resources may have an impact on the future stability of the iguana population.","Santa Fé is among the driest islands in the Galápagos. It receives 10 mm rainfall in dry years and 600 mm in rainy years, with an average annual temperature of 23.8° C (Marquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). Endemic tree cactus (<em>Opuntia echios</em>), truncated <em>Opuntia</em> species, Palo Santo tree (<em>Bursera graveolen</em>s), and two shrub species (<em>Cordia lutea</em> and <em>Lantana peduncularis</em>) constitute the dominant vegetation over most of the island (Christian and Tracy 1981). Iguanas eat the pads, fruits, and flowers of <em>Opuntia</em>, shrubs, vines, and grasses. The island is extremely rocky, with many cliffs and steep ridges. Iguanas predominantly use rock holes for retreat burrows as digging is difficult. There are a few isolated patches of habitat on the island that are suitable for nesting, with loose red cinder soil, that are flat and have relatively little vegetation cover. At the nesting sites, there is essentially no cover in the form of rock crevices that occur virtually everywhere else on the island. The dominant vegetation in the nesting area is the shrub <em>Encelia hispida</em> which neither adult nor hatchling were ever observed to eat (Christian and Tracy 1981).<br/><br/>Because of the topography of the island and unlike other regional iguanas, Barrington Land Iguanas nest communally in these few available sites. Females migrate to their specific nesting area (not necessarily the closest) at least 1.5 km from their normal home range. Nesting activity peaks in mid-October. Females fight for space during the exploratory digging phase and most defend their nests for a couple of days to over a month&#160;after laying their eggs. Hatchlings emerge in February coinciding with the beginning of heavy rains when the vegetation is lush and in bloom. Hatchlings (40 g, 10 cm body length) disperse from the nests within 1–2 days to areas with more cover and food. During emergence, the native Galápagos Hawk (<em>Buteo galapagoensis</em>) gathers and preys heavily on new hatchlings. Communal nesting has the disadvantage of attracting predators as well as nest failure from accidental excavation by late arriving nesting females (Christian and Tracy 1982).<br/><br/>Male Barrington Land Iguanas can reach 56.4 cm in snout-to-vent length and average 7.1 kg; females average 4.3 kg (Christian <em>et al</em>. 1985). Based on data for <em>Conolophus subcristatus</em>, these iguanas are expected to be reproductively mature at five years and remain so throughout their lifetime until <em>ca</em> 30 years (Fabiani <em>et al</em>. 2011). Their estimated generation length is therefore 17.5 years","Santa Fé is one of the few Galápagos islands where iguanas are not threatened by invasive alien predators such as cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) and Black Rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>). Only one report of a free-roaming domestic dog (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) was observed and removed (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, while predation by the native Galápagos Hawk is a natural event, because Barrington Land Iguanas are congregatory nesters, their impact on hatchling survival is significant and may have affected the rate of population recovery in this small population.<br/><br/>Barrington Land Iguanas experienced a severe genetic bottleneck in the past and now exhibit very low genetic diversity compared to other land iguana populations. Low genetic variability may have serious consequences for the fitness of the population and could reduce their ability to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions (including infectious disease) and demographic stability (Frankham <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is unknown if this lack of diversity will be deleteriously expressed in future generations of iguanas.<br/><br/>During 2015–2019, 549 juvenile Española Tortoises (<em>Chelonoidis hoodensis</em>) were released on Santa Fé, and more releases are planned annually until 2026 (Galápagos Conservancy 2015, 2019). Tortoises compete with land iguanas for scarce food resources, such as <em>Opuntia</em>, that are stressed during periods of drought. While this introduction is meant to replace a species that went extinct more than 150 years ago, the size of that historic tortoise population is unknown. It is unknown if the future climate will have increased frequency and duration of droughts and whether the tortoises and iguanas will impact each other's recovery.","The current population size and trend of the Barrington Land Iguana is unknown. The most recent systematic survey was completed in 2005 (Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010) using the Petersen mark-recapture method and estimated a total population of 5,016 individuals (range: 4,500–5,800). All age classes were seen; the male to female ratio was even. Based on the number of juveniles and adults captured, the number of mature adults in 2005 can be roughly estimated at 3,500–4,000. The population is known to have been impacted in the past by heavy human predation and food competition with goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) that were introduced in the 1930s. Photographs of the island in 1965 and 1973 showed the island was mostly completely barren of vegetation (Christian and Tracy 1980). Very low numbers of old adult iguanas were reported during 1967–1971 (Higgins 1978). In the 1980s, the iguana population density was considered to be low, though it is believed the population had stabilized, or nearly so, since the eradication of goats in 1972 (Snell <em>et al</em>. 1984, Snell and Christian 1985).<br/><br/>Molecular analysis has revealed that the Barrington Land Iguana has extremely low genetic variation and richness in comparison to several sampled populations of the Common Land Iguana (<em>Conolophus subcristatus</em>) and even the micro-endemic Galápagos Pink Land Iguana (<em>Conolophus marthae</em>) (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is possible that the intense grazing pressure goats had on the island's vegetation negatively impacted the iguana population, resulting in a decrease of the census size. This might have caused a further loss of genetic variation, still evident today despite a population increase after goats were eradicated.<br/><br/>Based on the low numbers of iguanas reported three generations ago (52 years) and their potentially stable population of 3,500–4,000 mature adults today, it is estimated that the Barrington Land Iguana population had declined by at least 50% during the occupation of invasive goats. It is unknown if the current population is close to carrying capacity.",Unknown,"The Barrington Land Iguana is only found on the uninhabited Santa Fé (Barrington) Island, Galápagos Archipelago, Ecuador (Gentile <em>et al</em>. 2009).

3187455,10269,Huso huso,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2010,2009-10-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species was historically known from the Caspian, Black, Azov and Adriatic Sea basins. It has been extirpated from the Adriatic (in the early 1970s, Gessner pers. comm.) and Azov Seas due to overfishing and loss of spawning sites due to dams. As the species is very long lived, individuals can still be caught in areas where their spawning sites have been cut off. The last wild population in the Black Sea basin migrates up the Danube river. All other Black Sea stocks are almost extirpated due to overfishing and impoundment of spawning rivers. In the Caspian basin, the last wild population migrates up the River Ural. The Volga population depends on stocking as the construction of Volgograd dam led to the loss of almost all of the species spawning sites in the river. Most of the few recorded females are in their first year of maturation. Based on catch data, and number of recorded spawning individuals it is estimated that the species has seen a wild native population decline of over 90% in the past three generations (a minimum of 60 years) and overfishing for meat and caviar will soon cause global extinction of the remaining natural wild populations. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking and effective fisheries management and combating illegal fishing. Range states are also encouraged to provide protection to the species spawning and feeding grounds.","At sea, this species is found in the pelagic zone, following food organisms. It migrates further upriver to spawn than any other sturgeon; however this migration has now been disrupted due to river regulation (in the Danube drainage up to Morava River). It spawns in strong-current habitats in the main course of large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom. <br/><br/>This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Males reproduce for the first time at 10-15 years, females at 15-18 years, with an estimated generation length of 20-25 years. This species spawns every 3-4 years in April-June. A complicated pattern of spawning migrations includes one peak in late winter and spring and one in late summer and autumn. In spring, it migrates from the sea before spawning. Individuals migrating in autumn remain in the rivers until the following spring. Spawning occurs at temperature from 6 to 14 °C in the channel and spring flooded spawning grounds at a current speed of 0.8-1.2 m / sec. Spawners the late winter/spring run dominate the spawners in the Volga River (80%), whereas the late summer/autumn&#160; run dominates in the Ural River. Yolk-sac larvae are pelagic for 7-8 days and drift with current. Juveniles migrate to sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. <br/><br/>In the past this species was the largest fish of the Caspian Sea, reaching lengths of more than 5 m and a weight of 1,000 kg. The lifetime of such large specimens, apparently, exceeded 100 years. Currently there are individuals up to 280 cm, weighing up to 650 kg. Average length of females is 240, males is 220 cm, weight respectively is 130 and 65 kg. The maximum age of 53 years was observed in 2003. <br/>&#160;<br/>Various environmental factors influence the distribution of the species in the Caspian Sea. One factor is water temperature, as mature Beluga prefer water temperatures not exceeding 30°C. They spend the spring and summer mostly in the northern and middle parts of the Caspian Sea and then move southwards to spend the winter in the southern areas, which coincides with highest densities of food organisms. The diet includes roach <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rutilus rutilus</span> (L.), common carp (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cyprinus carpio</span>&#160;L.), herrings (Clupeidae), kilka (Clupeonella), crayfish (Astacus), gobies (Gobiidae), pike-perch (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sander lucioperca</span> (L.)), birds, sturgeons (Acipenseridae), and even seal (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>., 1995). Mature individuals of Beluga are less sensitive to low temperature than the immature, as they feed in the northern part of the Caspian Sea under the ice. With water temperatures decreasing, Belugas reduce the range of depths at which they feed. Immature individuals in spring and autumn prefer the more desalinated sea areas. In summer the highest concentrations occur at the salinity of 3 to 7%. The largest concentrations of Beluga in the northern Caspian occur during the migration of its main prey organisms (herrings, kilka, gobies, roach, etc.).","Overfishing at sea and poaching in estuaries and rivers for meat and caviar is a major threat to the species. Overharvesting and a sharp increase in poaching has led to the largest and most mature specimens being removed from the population and reducing natural reproduction to almost zero (Krassikov and Fedin 1996). In the Ural river current fishing rates are 4 to 5 times sustainable levels (F Max) (Doukakis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. accepted). <br/><br/>Bycatch is also a threat to the species. The species caviar is very high value (8,000 USD per kilo in 2009).<br/><br/>Impoundment of rivers has destroyed most of the species spawning grounds. The Volgograd dam, built in 1955, has decreased the area of available spawning grounds by 88-100% in the Volga river, similar areas have been reduced in the Terek and Sulak rivers from 132 ha and 202 ha, respectively. The Don river dam removed 68,000 ha of spawning ground and flow regulation in the Kuban river led to the loss of 140,000 ha (CITES 2000).<br/><br/>Due to the longevity of the species there is evidence of pesticide contamination, leading to many problems including reduced reproductive success (Gessner, J. pers comm.).<br/><br/>The Allee effect could also be a threat to the species.","Global fisheries statistics show that there has been a 93% decline in catch from 1992 (520 tonnes) to 2007 (33 tonnes) (FAO 2009).<br/><br/>The number of Beluga annually entering the Volga dropped from 26,000 (1961-65) to 2,800 (1998-2002), a decline of 89% in 33 years (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Only 2,500 migrated up Ural in 2002 (Pikitch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). <br/><br/>Currently it is thought that nearly 100% of Beluga in the Volga are hatchery reared, but there is evidence of spawning elsewhere in its distribution (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Despite intensive restocking in the Caspian Sea (91% of each generation is estimated to come from hatchery stock), the annual catch in the northern Caspian Sea has drastically fallen. Catches in the Caspian were: 1945-55 average of 1,380 tonnes; 1956-65 average of 1,283 tonnes; 1966-75 average of 1,623 tonnes; 1976-85 average of 849 tonnes; 1986-95 average of 506 tonnes; 1996-2003 (latest data) average of 60.8 tonnes (in Doukakis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> accepted). This shows a decline of 95%. The official catch statistics support this trend, as they show that the species was abundant in 1938 and then stable to the late 1980s, with the major decline starting from 1990 to the present showing over a 90% decline in the past 60 years (see Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The agreed Beluga catch quota for all of the Caspian Sea (2007/8 - 28th session of the Commission) was 99.8 tonnes; this quota was not achieved. The proportion of Beluga (to other sturgeon species) in trawl catches of the northern Caspian Sea in all seasons of observations was at an average of 11%. Over the recent years, this percentage has decreased to 8.3%, and the catch of beluga during trawl surveys did not exceed 31 specimens per year&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Spawning numbers for the Volga from 1961-65 was 26,000, whilst in 1996/1997 it was 1,800 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000), with 2,800 in 1998-2002 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><br/>In the Sea of Azov, between 1979-1981 it is estimated that 551,000 individuals existed (from stocked, and dominated by sub-adult and juveniles); in 1988-1993 there were 25,000 and after 1994 they were only caught sporadically, despite banning of commercial fishing of Beluga in 1986. After 1986 the major threat was from bycatch. Since 1994, 98% of individuals recorded in the Azov Sea have been juvenile. In 2001 the first individuals were produced from captive bred individuals and released (Chebanov and Koziritskaya 2007).<br/><br/>Catches in the Danube have also declined. In the mid-Danube the annual catch was 23 tonnes (average between 1972-76) which dropped to 7.5 tonnes (average between 1985-89), a decline of 67% in around 12 years (CITES 2000). In 2002, 21.3 tonnes were caught in Romania, whilst only 8.4 tonnes were caught in 2005, showing a 60% decline in three years. The percentage of catch quota achieved in Romania was 85% in 2002, 84% in 2003, 46% in 2004, and 34% in 2005. In 2006 the catching of Beluga was banned in the Danube (Paraschiv <em>et al</em>. 2006).",Decreasing,"This species has been recorded in the basins of the Caspian, Black, Azov, and Adriatic Seas, however its current native wild distribution is restricted to the Black Sea (in the Danube only) and the Caspian Sea (in the Ural only). It is one of the largest anadromous fish in the Caspian Sea, where at least three Beluga populations have been identified by microsatellite technique (Pourkazemi 2008). It does occur in the Azov Sea, and Volga River but these are stocked fish.",This species is targeted for its skin and as a leather. Caviar is also used as cosmetic and medicinal purposes. Intestine use as sauce (food) and to produce gelatine. Swim bladder used to produce glue.,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"This species was listed on CITES Appendix II in 1998. Restocking programmes are ongoing. However the programmes do not compensate for the loss of natural reproduction and the populations continue to decline (CITES 2000). <br/><br/>The annual number of fingerlings released into the Volga show 0.4 million in 1951; 13.1 million between 1966-70 (average per year); 19.4 million between 1981-85; 11.3 million between 1996-2000; and 3 million between 2001-2005 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). The Report of the 28th Session of Caspian Bioresource Commission states that the total fingerling release of beluga in 2008 was 7.02 million from Russia, Iran and Khazakstan. <br/><br/>Some natural reproduction of the species remains in the Volga and Ural Rivers. However, at present the abundance of Beluga is extremely low. Since 2000 in Russia, it has only been caught for the purposes of reproduction (for hatcheries) and science. The protective measures at the feeding grounds are necessary to maintain the population of beluga, as well as the preservation of natural spawning and juveniles breeding at hatcheries.<br/><br/>In the Danube the release of recruitment size (over 15 cm long) from Romania into the Danube has risen from 12,500 in 2006, to 15,130 in 2007 and 20,000 in 2008 (Suciu pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Iran, in work with the World Bank, are increasing the rate of release of Beluga; in 2003, 6,000 individuals (CWT tagged and visible tagged) were released. The size of the released individuals has been increased from 3-5 g to 10-25 g to increase survival rates (Pourali <em>et al</em>. 2003). Hatchery experts (which are state owned) are given financial incentives upon the delivery of individuals ready to be released. Iran has also developed beluga farming to supply meat and caviar production to minimize the impact to the wild population (Pourkazemi pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The species is not fully protected in any range state, though fishing licences are required in most countries and Iran has banned private sturgeon fisheries. Overall however, enforcement measures seem to be lacking. In 1996, fishing in the open sea for the species was banned through an agreement between the countries bordering the Caspian Sea. Artificial spawning grounds have been attempted below Volgograd dam, which has shown some success (Ruban pers. comm.). In the Sea of Azov commercial fishing was banned in 1986.<br/><br/>Gene banks, DNA and tissue cryopreservation exists in Iran and Russia.<br/><br/>Azerbaijan have voluntarily proposed a zero quota for Caviar export for 2009 to CITES.<br/><br/>Range states are also encouraged to provide protection to the species spawning and feeding grounds.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

13040387,229,Acipenser stellatus,Critically Endangered,A2cde,2010,2009-10-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species was known from the Caspian, Black and Aegean Seas. It is now extirpated from the Aegean Sea, and in the Black Sea basin the last natural population migrates up the Danube where it is heavily overfished. Only very few spawners remain in the rest of the Black Sea basin. The Caspian populations are under massive pressure from overfishing (including poaching) and loss of spawning sites and the stocks are declining very fast. Almost all migrating spawners are poached below the Volgograd dam. Overfishing will soon cause extinction of the natural populations. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking and effective fisheries management and combating illegal fishing. Based on catch data, and number of individuals migrating into the Volga and Ural rivers it is estimated that the species has undergone a population decline of at least 80% (possibly close to 100%) in the past three generations (minimum estimate of 30 years, possibly up to 40), which is expected to continue. Catch data shows massive declines across the species range with a 98% decline between 1980 and 2007 in the Caspian Sea, and a 72.5% in four years (2002-2005) in Romania (Danube).","This species is found at sea, coastal and estuarine zones, where it forages on clayey sand bottoms, as well as intensively in middle and upper water layers. It spawns in strong-current habitats in the main course of large and deep rivers, on stone or gravel bottoms. It is also known to spawn on flooded river banks, on sand or sandy clay. Juveniles inhabit shallow riverine habitats during their first summer&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Caspian fish first mature at 6-7 years for males, and 7-8 years for females, with a generation length not less than 10 years. Females reproduce every 3-4 years and males every 2-3 years in April-September. It spawns only under relatively constant hydrological conditions, as fluctuating hydrological conditions lead to high egg mortality. This species migrates upriver at higher temperatures and therefore later than other sturgeons, with two peaks, in spring and in autumn. Males remain at spawning sites no longer than six weeks and females only 10-12 days. Spent individuals migrate directly back to sea. Yolk-sac larvae are pelagic for 2-3 days and drift with current. Juveniles migrate to sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. At sea, this species feeds on a wide variety of crustaceans, molluscs and benthic as well as pelagic fish&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The main habitat in the Caspian Sea of the Stellate Sturgeon in the winter is the middle part of the sea (Legeza 1970). In the spring they migrate to the north, with its maximum density being observed off the mid-west coast in shallow water rich in food organisms (Legeza 1970). In late spring they move to the north-west coast. In autumn Stellate Sturgeons begin migrating to the south of the Caspian Sea (earlier than other species), concentrating at the mid-western coast and the south-eastern coast (Legeza 1970). <br/><br/>The spawning migration starts in April. Spawning occurs at temperatures from 9 to 16 °C in the channel and spring flooded spawning grounds at the current speed of 0.8-1.2 m / sec. The greatest number of Stellate Sturgeon migrate to the Ural River (Peseridi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1986, Dovgopol <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1992). Stellate Sturgeon stop eating after the beginning of the spawning migration. After spawning, they return downstream into the sea, where they begin actively feeding. The juveniles of Stellate Sturgeon also do not delay in the river and migrate for feeding into the sea.","The reason for Stellate Sturgeon abundance decrease is primarily due to marine fishing and a sharp increase of poaching, seizing the largest and mature fish and nullifying the natural reproduction of sturgeon. In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Single specimens of Stellate Sturgeon were harvested at the Azerbaijan coast during a trawl survey in 1994; this is most likely due to heavy illegal fishing (large number of poaching gears were observed).<br/><br/>Overfishing has prevented hatcheries catching enough mature individuals to maintain the necessary broodstock (Artyukhin 1997 in CITES 2000), and stocking has severely decreased in the Caspian Sea as the stocking process relies upon wild individuals (unlike other sturgeon species they are difficult to keep mature individuals in ponds, Nikolai pers. comm.). The annual release (over the past 10 years) of sturgeon juveniles from sturgeon hatcheries in Russia amounts to from 3 to 20 million specimens; in Kazakhstan - from 2.5 to 4.1 million specimens; in Azerbaijan - from 2.5 to 6.8 million specimens; in Islamic Republic of Iran - from 0.2 to 1.3 million specimens. This quantity of stocks recruitment of Stellate Sturgeon from industrial sturgeon culture is not enough to supply the population at an optimum level&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>Dams have also led to the loss of many spawning grounds. For example the Volgograd dam (built in 1955) led to loss of 40% of spawning sites formally available in the Volga (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). The species is also considered extirpated from the upper and middle Danube since the building of the Djerdap Dams (Iron Gate Dams). The Don River dam removed 68,000 ha of spawning ground and flow regulation in the Kuban led to the loss of 140,000 ha of spawning grounds.<br/><br/>Pollution is a threat to the species. In 1990, 55,000 sturgeon were found dead on the shore of the Sea of Azov as the result of pollution.<br/><br/>The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species (Gessner, J. pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Introduced Mnemiopsis (from US) which impacts the species food source (pelagic fishes) has impacted the Black Sea population (impacts now reduced in Black Sea) and is now impacting the Caspian Sea populations.<br/><br/>Introduction of fertilized eggs (from before 1986 and again 2003/4, and it may continue) from the Caspian Sea into the Azov Sea may impact the genetic integrity of Azov Sea population (Chebanov pers. comm.).","In the early 1990s it was estimated that nearly 100% of the Sea of Azov population and 30% of the Caspian Sea population were from stocking. Recent estimations are that more than 50% of the Caspian Sea populations are from stocking (Pourkazemi pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Global catches show that in 1992, 2,730 tonnes were caught, falling to a low of 38 tonnes in 2004, and 50 tonnes in 2007 (a decline of over 98% in 15 years). The average catch between 1992-1999 was 1,063 tonnes, and between 2000 and 2007 it was 132 tonnes, a decline of 87% (FAO 2009). The decline in commercial catch for the species is believed to reflect a decline in the species population (CITES 2000). <br/><br/>For the whole Caspian basin, catch peaked in 1977 with 13,700 tonnes; this has shown an almost continuous decline to 305 tonnes in 2003 (most recent data) (over 97% decline in 32 years) (Pikitch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). In 2008 the agreed catch quota for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A.stellatus</span> for all Caspian Sea countries in 2008 was set at 240 tonnes, including commercial and scientific catch; the quota has not been met (Pourkazemi pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2009) shows that the average numbers of spawners entering the lower Volga per year has fallen from a peak of 230,000 (between 1986-90) to just 50,000 (between 1998-2002), a decline of 78%. It is expected that the decline has continued at a similar rate to the present time (though data does not exist) and will continue. In the Ural the estimated number of migrating individuals per year has also shown a decline, in 1970: 1,100,000; 1979: 1,050,000; 1990: 300,000 migrating individuals (Veschev 1995); 1998: 103,600; 2001: 87,400 (Pikitch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). This shows a 92% decline from 1979 to 2001 (also from 1970 to 2001, as migrating individuals per year remained relatively stable between 1970 and 1979).<br/><br/>Distribution of Stellate Sturgeon in the Caspian Sea has declined (based on CPUE distribution data) from the 1970s to 2004 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).<br/><br/>In summer, Stellate Sturgeon feed in the warmer waters, forming the densest concentration, more than 0.6 specimens per 10,000 m<sup>3</sup> in the western region of the Caspian sea; this is four times higher than was recorded in 1994 (Khodorevskaya <em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). Concentration of all species of sturgeons and in particular, of Stellate Sturgeon, remains high in the area off the island of Ogurchinskii in the southern part of the Caspian Sea off the Turkmenian coast, but its abundance has declined 3.4 times compared to 1991&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The total population size in the investigated water in 2008 was between 6.7-9.5 million specimens, this has fallen from 83 million in 1988&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>Over recent decades, Stellate Sturgeon abundance in the Caspian Sea has reduced. Evidence of this is shown in the decrease of the average catch per unit effort during trawl surveys between 1978-1999. These showed a three-fold decrease in the northern Caspian Sea, a 2.7-fold decline in the middle part of the Caspian Sea and a six-fold decline off the Dagestan coast (Vlasenko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). Decrease of CPUE has been more apparent in the southern part of the sea. The Stellate Sturgeon population has declined from 69.7 million specimens in 1978 to 15.6 million in 2002, and 7.6 million specimens in 2008. Commercial stock decreased by 12 times during this period&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In the Black Sea, in Romania, from 2002-2005 the catches of wild individuals (stocking only started in 2006 in the Danube) dropped from 12.427 tonnes to 3.43 tonnes (72.5% in 4 years); in 2006 commercial catch was stopped (Suciu pers comm.). In Azov Sea, no wild mature females have been caught [for a stocking programme] since 2004 (Chebanov pers. comm.).",Decreasing,"Stellate Sturgeon inhabits in the Caspian, Black and Azov Seas, and rarely in the Aegan Sea. The Volga, Ural, Terek, Sulak, Kura, Don, Danube, Kuban Rivers are the major spawning rivers. The length of the spawning migration route of the Volga to the cascade of dams is up to Rybinsk, in the Ural - to Uralsk, in the Don - to Pavlovsk, in the Kuban - to Armavir. The highest abundance and biomass of natural population remained in the Caspian Sea. <br/><br/>The feeding area in the Caspian Sea of Stellate Sturgeon extended from the shallow water area of the northern part of the sea to the Iranian coast. An intensive migration of Stellate Sturgeon began in spring (March-May) to the shallow water area, in the Northern Caspian where the largest concentrations of fish were observed at the western coast of this part of the sea, as well as in the pre-mouth areas in the eastern part of the Volga River Delta (Belinskii and Igolkinskii Banks&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009)).<br/><br/><br/><sup></sup>","Skin and as a leather.

The Caspian basin has lost 70% of spawning grounds since the 1950s mainly due to hydroelectric power stations; flow regulation of the Kuban has led to the loss of 140,000 ha and damming of the river Don removed 68,000 ha spawning ground (CITES 2000).<br/><br/>The last natural population still migrates up the Danube and the Rioni (last recorded in Rioni in 1999), where the sturgeons are heavily overfished and poached. The Caspian populations are also under massive pressure from overfishing and loss of spawning habitats. Almost all migrating spawners are poached below the Volgograd dam. The Ural river still has spawning individuals.<br/><br/>It is estimated that the species' wild native population has undergone a massive population decline of over 90% in the past three generations (estimated at 45 years). This is based on the 88.5% decline in global catches of the species in just 15 years despite large levels of stocking (average global catch from 1992-1999 was 1,531.75 tonnes; from 2000-2007 it was 175.37 tonnes), the 92.5% decline in estimated spawning stock biomass in the Volga from 1961-65 to 1998-2000, the 88% decline in the average number of spawners entering the lower Volga from the 1962-75 average to the 1992-2002 average, and the decline in the Juvenile Production Index from Romanian Danube.<br/><br/>This decline is predicted to continue as illegal fishing at sea, and in rivers, for caviar will soon result in the extinction of the remaining natural wild population. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking.","Habitat: At sea, shallow coastal and estuarine zones. In freshwaters, in deep parts of large rivers with moderate to swift current. Spawns in strong current (1-1.5 m/s) in large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom. <br/><br/>Biology: Anadromous and freshwater populations (freshwater populations existed in the Danube and Volga - both are now extinct). A complicated pattern of spawning migrations includes spring and autumn runs. Individuals migrating in spring enter freshwater just before spawning; they tend to spawn in lower reaches of rivers (320-650 km in the unregulated Ural). Individuals migrating in autumn overwinter in rivers and spawn the following spring further upstream (900-1200 km in the Ural). <br/><br/>Males reproduce for the first time at 8-13 years, females at 10-16. Generation length (average age of parents of current cohort) is estimated to be 15 years under natural circumstances, but due to the impacts this species is facing the generation length ranges from between 12 years in the Caspian Sea to over 20 in the Danube. Females reproduce every 4-6 years and males every 2-3 years in April-June, when the temperature rises above 10°C. Larvae drift on currents; juveniles then move towards shallower habitats, before migrating to the sea during their first summer. They remain at sea until maturity. The Russian Sturgeon feeds on a wide variety of benthic molluscs, crustaceans and small fish.","Most spawning sites have been lost due to dam construction. The Caspian basin lost 70% of spawning grounds since the 1950s, mainly due to the construction of hydroelectric power stations; the Ural is now the only river in the basin with unregulated flow. Flow regulation of the Kuban River has led to the loss of 140,000 ha, and damming of the river Don has removed 68,000 ha spawning ground. For example, in the Yugoslavian section of the Danube, the annual catch dropped from 14,636 kg in 1983 to 1,636 kg in 1985 (a decline of just under 90%), this is believed to be due to the construction of the Djerdap (Irongate) II dam which was constructed in 1984, leaving no accessible spawning grounds for the species in the upstream reaches and in former Yugoslavia (CITES 2000).<br/><br/>Poaching and illegal fishing, which appears to be increasing, is also a threat to the species. Enforcement of legislation regulating the fishery for the species appear to be lacking. In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Bycatch is also a threat to the species (in both marine and freshwater).<br/><br/>High levels of pollution (from oil and industrial waste), in both the Black and Caspian Sea basins have altered hormonal balance, and increased the number of hermaphroditic fish. Pollution levels are now decreasing since the break up of the Soviet Union (Levin, 1977 in CITES 2000). In 1990, 55,000 sturgeon were found dead on the shore of the Sea of Azov as the result of pollution.<br/><br/>Genetic pollution is also a potential threat as stocks are moved to different locations (e.g. Caspian stocks moved to Sea of Azov).<br/><br/>The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species.","The species wild native population has undergone major decline which is currently occurring. But due to the large levels of stocking (particularly Russia and Iran) the exact levels are unknown. According to CITES (2000) Russia released 25 million fingerlings into the Vologa between 1979-80, 35 million between 1981-85, 40.8 million between 1986-90, 42 million between 1991-95 and 28 million 1996-98; Iran released 300,000 fingerlings in 1994 which has risen nearly every year to 960,000 in 1999.<br/><br/>Despite this level of stocking, fisheries catches have fallen, particularly from the early 1990s in the Caspian. According to FAO fisheries statistics (FAO 2009) global catches fell from 4,250 tonnes in 1992 (first available catch data) to 67 tonnes in 2007 (last available catch data), a decline of 98% in 15 years. The average catch from 1992-1999 (8 year period) was 1,531.75 tonnes, whereas the average catch from 2000-2007 (8 year period) was 175.37 tonnes, a decline of 88.5%.<br/><br/>Data from the Caspian Sea (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009) shows similar declines: catches were between 6,000 and 9,000 tonnes per year in the 1960s to a peak of around 14,500 tonnes in the late 1970s early 1980s to less than 1,000 per year from 2000 to 2008. The estimated spawning stock biomass in the Volga has also drastically declined, from 13,200 tonnes (1961-65) and 22,200 tonnes (1966-70) to 1,000 tonnes (1996-97) and 1,000 tonnes (1998-2002).

A Juvenile Production Index (evidence of breeding) for the Danube (Romania) also shows a decline: CPUE was just over 0.7 in 2000, &lt; 0.2 in 2001, 0.3 in 2002, 0 in 2003, &lt; 0.1 in 2004, 0.1 in 2005, 0 in 2006, &lt; 0.05 in 2007 and 0 in 2008.

However, it is suspected that the native wild population has declined by over 80% in the past three generations (estimated at 42 years) as all the wild populations have almost disappeared, apart from the restocked individuals from Iran. There are only occasional records from the northern Caspian basin (in 2008, 100 immature individuals were caught in the northern Caspian basin (Mugue pers. comm.)). Overfishing at sea for caviar will soon cause extinction of natural populations.","Habitat: At sea, coastal and estuarine zones. Spawns in strong-current habitats in the main course of large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom. Juveniles are found in riverine habitats during their first summer. <br/><br/>Biology: Anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Males reproduce for the first time at 8-15 years, females at 12-18. Age range for mature females is 6-40 years; 85% are between 14-18 years, and 80% of males are between 12-16yrs (Moghim 2003). Average generation length is 14 years. This species does not spawn every year. Spawning takes place in June-August when temperature rises above 16°C. In the southern Caspian basin, the Persian Sturgeon spawns in April-September but reproduction is interrupted from June to August when temperature rises above 25°C. Most individuals migrate upriver in April-May, but some may enter rivers at other times of the year. In the southern Caspian basin, there is a second run in September-October. Juveniles migrate to the sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. At sea, the Persian Sturgeon feeds on a wide variety of benthic molluscs, crustaceans and small fish.<br/><br/>This species has different ecological biological requirements to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. gueldenstaedtii</span>, as it prefers warmer water for spawning and has a shorter migration run.","Illegal fishing/poaching across the Caspian region is the principle threat. In the Caspian Sea, the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Bycatch is also a threat to the species in both rivers and the Caspian Sea. In 1996, fish inspection authorities filed 8,000 citations for violations committed by individuals, mainly in the Astrakhan region along the Volga (Vecsei and Artyukhin 2001).<br/><br/>In Iran, pollution from agriculture and domestic waste causes loss and degradation of spawning sites. In Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, oil and industrial pollution has led to the loss of suitable feeding grounds. In Russia, oil pollution is a potential threat. Dams across the region have also led to the blocking of access to spawning grounds.<br/><br/>The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species.<br/><br/>The lack of ability to genetically identify the species in international trade is a potential threat, as Russian and Persian Sturgeon (caviar) can be mixed.","The only legal commercial exploitation of this species is in Iran (mainly from hatchery stock).

14871490,22823,Ursus maritimus,Vulnerable,A3c,2015,2015-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is understood to be a significant component of clupeid catch in at least one of these localities, but generally, the proportion of overall catch which it represents is unknown. Its fast turnover rate makes it resilient to moderate threats and it is not known to be heavily exploited in some parts of its range (USA) nor are there reports of declines off Brazil.&#160;Therefore, it is listed as Least Concern with a recommendation to improve management of clupeid fisheries in the aforementioned areas.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>","This pelagic, schooling species occurs in coastal waters, including estuaries, lagoons, mangroves, and seagrass beds (Ortaz <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1996, Felix <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007).

Its maximum recorded length is 18 cm TL (Lieske and Myers 1994), but is common to 9 cm (Nizinski and Munroe 2002).&#160;This species is small, fast-growing, and short lived (k = 0.69) (Posada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1988). Typical of tropical clupeids, it is suspected that this species has a relatively short life span (probably 3-5 years).","All life history stages of this species occur in inshore environments (including seagrass beds, mangroves, and estuaries) and are thus easily accessible for exploitation as both food and bait resources. These inshore environments are susceptible to coastal zone development and other anthropogenic impacts. However, exploitation and habitat degradation are not considered to be major threats for its global population.","This species forms medium to large size schools (sometimes occurs with other species of <em>Harengula</em>) and can be locally abundant (Whitehead 1985, Randall 1996). It is very abundant off Brazil (Vasconellos <em>et al.</em> 2011, Vilar <em>et al.</em> 2011, Souza-Conceicao <em>et al.</em> 2013). It has been documented that fishing mortality rates are significantly higher than natural mortality rates in Venezuela (Posada 1999).&#160;In Mexico, this species is primarily landed as part of a mixed-species clupeoid catch taken by beach seine and gillnet in small coastal fisheries. Mixed catches of clupeoid species (the majority of which is&#160;<em>Opisthonema oglinum</em>) represent about 58% of all landings in Veracruz and about 42% of those in Yucatán (SAGARPA 2012). Landings in Veracruz, which are primarily from beach seine fisheries, reached a peak of 1005 tonnes in 1997 decreasing to 42 t in 2008. Landings in small pelagic fisheries in Yucatán increased to a peak of roughly 4500 tonnes in 1998 and then decreased to less than 100 t in 2008. This fishery is considered fully exploited/exploited to maximum sustainability (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;In Cuba, there has been a 35% decline in catches of clupeids in general over the last 20 years, which mostly consists of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harengula humeralis</span>&#160;and&#160;<em>H. clupeola</em>&#160;(F. Pina-Amargos pers. comm. 2012). In Jamaica and the US Virgin Islands, anecdotal evidence also suggests a declining population trend (K. Aiken and J. Brown pers. comm. 2012).&#160;In Puerto Rico, this species undertakes inshore migrations during the spawning season where it incurs significant fishing pressure (Pena-Alvarado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Kimmel (1991) carried out a baitfish survey in Puerto Rico in 1986, suggesting baitfish landings were lower than for any of the previous three years examined. Similar declines have also been noted in the bait fisheries for clupeids in the US Virgin Islands (Beets and LaPlace 1991) and is similar to data from Jamaica.",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from eastern Florida, the Bahamas, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and along the South American coast to Santa Catarina, Brazil (Souza-Conceicao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Ribeiro <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;<p></p>","Clupeids in general, <em>Harengula</em> species in particular, are important in bait fisheries throughout their ranges (LeGore 2007, Pena-Alvarado <em>et al.</em> 2009, J.

It is caught mainly with purse seines, beach seines and cast nets and marketed mostly fresh; probably also reduced to fish meal together with other clupeid fishes (Munroe 2002, SAGARPA 2012).&#160;Its flesh has an unpleasant odor and it is considered to be toxic in some locations, such as Venezuela and Antigua, where it is considered to be unsuitable for human consumption (Posada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1988).&#160;Separate species-specific statistics are not reported, but combined&#160;catches of <em>Harengula</em> species for 1995 were 1 117 t (Cuba: 1 045 t; Dominican  Republic: 72 t).&#160;In Veracruz, this fishery once supported irregular canning operations.

On the assumption that its breeding biology is similar to that of other species of <em>Boulengerula</em>, it is oviparous with direct development.","Assuming that soil moisture and temperature maintained by vegetation is important for the species, and bearing in mind the species' preference for forest over cultivated habitat, possible threats are habitat disturbance and conversion. In the Shimba Hills, forest disturbance is an ongoing occurrence due to elephant activity; however, the subpopulation occurring in the forest patches of the Shimba Hills National Reserve is relatively secure (P.K. Malonza pers. comm. August 2012). In Kaya Jibana Forest, human disturbance of the forest (cutting of poles and collection of fire wood) threatens the habitat. In Changamwe and the surrounding areas, additional threats are farming and human encroachment; specifically, the intensification of agriculture, application of pesticides and herbicides, the slash-and-burn method, and expanding human settlements (P.K.

The island is inaccessible and not subject to ongoing or any known historical threats, however, invasive species, extreme weather and potentially any decline in the populations of the seabirds on which the island's ecology depends are all plausible future threats that could rapidly drive the species to Critically Endangered or Extinct. Although the island's inaccessibility has afforded it a high degree of natural protection and there has been no recent increase in human traffic to Serpent Island, there are an average of three invasions by exotic predators annually within the Mauritian archipelago and this species is reliant on continued vigilance by conservation management for its protection.","The Serpent Island Night Gecko is nocturnal, terrestrial and insectivorous (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2005, 2009). Serpent Island is mostly open bare rock with occasional cavities and crevices, and small sparse rock piles associated with thin soil patches that the geckos utilize to take refuge (Cole 2005, 2009). There are very sparse and isolated grass and herb patches. In 2003, geckos were found at elevations from 32 m asl. to the summit of the island at 136 m above sea level (N. Cole unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The island supports four seabird species that together comprise more than half a million individuals (Arnold and Jones 1994, Tatayah<em> et al. </em>2004). The seabirds maintain the island’s ecosystem by bringing marine nutrients to the island, via faeces, regurgita, dead eggs and chicks that support the numerous invertebrates the geckos feed upon (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2005). Lizards have been found taking refuge beneath nesting seabirds during the day (Cole 2009). They have an average total body length of 11 cm, just over half of which is tail, with females being slightly larger than males (Arnold and Jones 1994; Cole 2005, 2009). They are relatively slow-moving in comparison to other Mauritian geckos (Arnold and Jones 1994, N. Cole pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The only other reptile on Serpent Island is the large form of Bojer’s Skink (<em>Gongylomorphus bojerii</em>). While this species was once suspected to prey on the geckos (Vinson and Vinson 1969) this is now thought to be unlikely (Vinson 1975, Arnold and Jones 1994). The main predator of adult and juvenile geckos is instead thought to be the large endemic tarantula <em>Mascaraneus remotus</em> (Arnold and Jones 1994, Gallon 2005).<br/><br/>Geckos were collected in 1993 and maintained in open enclosures on mainland Mauritius, where it was noted that introduced Common Myna birds (<em>Acridotheres tristis</em>) would predate them (Arnold and Jones 1994). The geckos are highly vocal, producing a loud repeated metallic ‘tchick’ sound, from which they can be easily identified from all other non-<em>Nactus </em>species in Mauritius up to a distance of approximately 50 m (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2009). The geckos call mostly at dusk and dawn, which has been used in combination with visual searches to survey the Mascarenes and outer islands for other night gecko populations (Cole 2005, N. Cole unpubl. data). The geckos are thought to reproduce between August and March (Arnold and Jones 1994). Females lay one egg at a time, producing more than one clutch within a season, incubation is approximately three to four months and hatchlings reach maturity within a year (Arnold and Jones 1994). Their life history is presumed to be similar to the Durrell’s Night Gecko, which has a generation time of 2.9 years (Cole<em> et al.</em> 2009, N. Cole unpubl. data).","The Serpent Island night gecko occupies an extremely restricted area and would be at immediate risk from introduced mammalian, reptilian or invertebrate predators. The most notable potential threats are from rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>), cats, Asian Musk Shrews (<em>Suncus murinus</em>), Tailless Tenrecs (<em>Tenrec ecaudatus</em>), Indian Wolf Snakes (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>) and Common Myna birds (Arnold 1980, 2000; Arnold and Jones 1994; Cole 2005, 2011; Cheke and Hume 2008; Cole <em>et al.</em> 2009; Cole and Payne 2015; Goder <em>et al</em>. 2015; Mauritius Reptile Recovery Programme unpubl. data). The introduced House Gecko (<em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em>) is a potential competitor and predator of Mauritian night geckos elsewhere in the archipelago, and so may also represent a threat if introduced to Serpent Island (Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2005). The Big-headed Ant (<em>Pheidole megacephala</em>) and tropical fire ant (<em>Solenopsis geminata</em>) are potential predators (Cole 2005).<br/><br/>None of these invasive predators has yet been detected on Serpent Island, but currently there are on average three faunal incursions to Mauritian islands per year, which includes predatory species for which there are no current methods for eradication (Cole and Payne 2015). Whilst the threat of invasion by non-native predators is ongoing and could cause the extinction of the Serpent Island Night Gecko within a short period, the island is a Closed Island Nature Reserve where public access is prohibited and it is difficult and dangerous to access.<br/><br/>The island has few means for water retention and as such prolonged drought is likely to be a threat to the gecko population (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009). Potential declines in seabird numbers on the island would severely limit the availability of nutrients and food resources, in turn causing the decline in the gecko population (Cole 2005). Online reports suggest that significant declines in seabird populations are ongoing in the southwest Indian Ocean (N. Cole pers. comm. 2018), as has been found for seabird populations globally (e.g. Paleczny <em>et al.</em> 2015).","The global population of this gecko is restricted to the small and poorly-surveyed Serpent Island (Arnold and Jones 1994; Arnold 2000; Cole 2005, 2009), and was not discovered until 1948. There have been only three nocturnal trips to Serpent Island since its discovery, each of a single night: in 1993, 2000 and 2003 (Arnold and Jones 1994, Freeman 2003, Cole 2005). Consequently very little data is available on the population size or trend of this nocturnal gecko, and only a couple of individuals have been found in the daytime (Loveridge 1951, Cole 2005).<br/><br/>Prior to the 1993 survey the species was considered to be extremely rare, with only one individual to have been captured (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Arnold and Jones 1994), however no nocturnal surveys had previously been conducted and very few trips have been made during the day due to the difficulty of landing. In 1993, the geckos were found to be common on the upper two-thirds of the island, with 24 individuals being detected at an encounter rate of 16 geckos per person hour (Arnold and Jones 1994). Geckos were also found to be common common in 2003 with 31 geckos detected, at a slightly lower encounter rate of 11 geckos per person hour (Cole 2005). A comparison of recorded encounter rates on Serpent Island with those for Durrell’s Night Gecko on Round Island in areas of similar habitat, the adult population size of the Serpent Island Night Gecko is likely to consist of <em>ca</em>&#160;8,000 (95% confidence range 4,500-11,000) individuals (N. Cole unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Serpent Island is a barren rock and is believed to be relatively pristine, having rarely been accessed by humans and being free from threatening invasive alien species (Lloyd 1846, Safford 1992, Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2005, N. Cole unpubl. data). It can therefore be assumed that the population size is relatively stable.",Stable,"The Serpent Island Night Gecko is a Mauritian endemic which is restricted to Serpent Island (0.27 km<sup>2</sup>). It is considered as a derived form of the Durrell’s Night Gecko (<em>N. durrellorum</em>), having been isolated on Serpent Island for more than 10,000 years (Arnold and Jones 1994, Camoin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Cole 2005).","<em>Nactus serpensinsula </em>is listed in Appendix II by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora.

There is no firm evidence for a significant range-wide population decline that warrants listing in a higher category of threat at the present time; however, its status could change as pressures on its habitat grow and if hunting of larger-bodied primates continues to intensify in the western parts of its range.","<em>Colobus guereza</em> is arboreal, but will travel across the ground between patches of forest. It occupies a wide range of forest types including low, mid-montane and montane moist forest, ground water forest, secondary forest, riverine forest, swamp forest and gallery forest. It is often common in secondary or degraded forest (Fashing and Oates 2013, Groves and Ting 2013). <em>Colobus guereza</em> is strictly folivorous in some regions, but feeds both on leaves and fruits in others (Fashing and Oates 2013). They live in groups of 2-10 adults, and group home ranges are from 1.5 to 100 ha (Fashing and Oates 2013, Groves and Ting 2013).","<em>Colobus guereza</em> is one of the few primate species which responds well to low to medium levels of habitat disturbance.

It has been successfully introduced to Faure Island via several translocations (assisted colonization) between 2004 and 2012; this subpopulation is still establishing. All three island subpopulations are subject to plausible threats, especially the drying climate and introductions of exotic predators which would make it become Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a short time, hence it is listed as Vulnerable under criterion D2.</p>","<p>On Bernier, Dorre and Faure Islands the species shelters under dense thickets of <em>Acacia ligulata</em>, <em>A. coriacea</em> and <em>Alectryon oleifolius</em> on sandplains and <em>Diplolaena dampieri</em> and <em>A. oleifolius</em> on dunes. Beneath these shrubs, it forms runways. Several individuals may be found sheltering in one patch of shrubs, although adults of each sex appear to live in well-defined individual home ranges or territories. Feeding takes place at night in open areas. Grasses usually make up less than half the dietary intake with the remainder being composed of malvaceous and leguminous shrubs and other dicotyledons (Richards <em>et al</em>. 2001; Prince and Richards 2008). </p>","The current major threats to the subpopulations of the species include: the introduction of predators (feral cats and Red Foxes, dogs) to islands, destructive wildfire, and disease (Richards 2007). Introduced black rats and mice are also a concern, but to a lesser degree than the larger predators. Extreme fluctuations in populations on islands are a threat, but this threat is seen as minor relative to the risk exotic predators being introduced (Short <em>et al.</em> 1997). As extreme weather events become more common, and given that all locations for the species are nearby islands in Shark Bay, these fluctuations are a cause for concern as the area is predicted to continue to suffer reduced annual rainfall. The species presumably was extirpated from mainland Australia by a combination of&#160;predation by the Red Fox and feral cat and habitat disturbance.","Abundance on Bernier and Dorre Islands fluctuates greatly with rainfall. Surveys in 1988/89 indicated a total population of about 7700 animals, equally divided between the two islands (Short and Turner 1992), and 9700 in 1991/92 (Short <em>et al</em>. 1997). Recent surveys for this species estimated the number on Bernier Island as 1807 individuals and on Dorre Island as 2294 individuals (Reinhold 2010 in Roache 2011). Reintroduction attempts to Dirk Hartog Island and Peron Peninsula failed due to predation by the feral Cat and drought (Prince and Richards 2008). The first translocation to Faure Island, from which feral Cats have been eradicated, was in 2004, and was seven animals; these were supplemented every one to two years from the Peron captive breeding facility, as animals became available, in order to boost founder size numerically and genetically.

Average body length reaches 126-129 cm, with a maximum body length of approximately 140 cm (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Both sexes become sexually mature at about 6 years of age, with most breeding females (74% in a 1974 sample) aged between 8 and 17 years (Popov 1979, 1982). The pregnancy rate for females older than 9 is reported to be as low as 0.2-0.33 (Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Miyazaki 2002), and Krylov (1990) reports a similar low rate of 0.34 for females aged 10-14 years. Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), acknowledge that the reproductive rate is low in females &gt;20 years old, but suggest that the reproductive rate is &gt;0.5 for females &lt;20 years old taken together as a group. Since females &lt;20 years old make up approximately two-thirds of the population of adult females, they probably drive the overall reproductive rate for the population up to about 0.5. Both Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1999) and Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) attribute the lower reproductive rates of older females to the effect of long term exposure to organochlorine contaminants in the older animals. Accumulation of contaminants with age has been documented in Caspian seals, but most animals appear to be below thresholds associated with reproductive pathologies (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Pups are generally born from mid-January to late February on the ice, with a birth weight of around 5 kg (Popov 1979), and are nursed for 4-5 weeks. In contrast to ringed seals, females do not usually construct lairs (Frost and Lowry 1981), possibly because sufficient amounts of snow overlying the ice are normally lacking. Pupping on the ice without lairs has allowed direct counts of pups to be made in the recent aerial surveys (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pups do not enter the water until the ice melts in mid to late March.<br/><br/>The first documented observations of small numbers of Seals breeding in other parts of the Caspian were made in 1982, with females reported pupping on small sand islands in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, although it is likely this behaviour was not new (Krylov 1990). Large numbers of mostly nonbreeding Seals spend the winter in the middle and southern Caspian, with one estimate of 15,000 Seals along the Turkmenistan coast (Krylov 1990).<br/><br/>A post-breeding moult occurs from April to early May, during which the Seals first use the ice and then islands, sand bars, and reed beds for hauling out (Badamshin 1970, Krylov 1990). Presently, Komsomolets Bay and the Durnev Islands in Kazakhstan and Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj island in Russian waters represent the most important moulting habitats (Dmitrieva 2013). Aggregations of several tens of thousands of individuals can be found in Komsomoletz Bay during this period, and around ten thousand at Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj.<br/><br/>During late spring, summer, and early autumn, Caspian Seals are distributed throughout the Caspian Sea. They feed throughout the region, exploiting both the shallow basin in the north and the deep middle and southern basins (Krylov 1990). Recent satellite telemetry studies indicate about 60% of animals move to the middle and southern Caspian, with the remainder staying in the north, primarily around the inflow of Volga and Ural rivers (Dmitrieva 2013). The telemetry studies suggest considerable individual variation in summer migratory and foraging behavior, with individuals spending the summer period separated among shallow, intermediate, and deep water locations. This may reflect individual specialization or niche partitioning in relation to habitat or prey types (Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015a). <br/><br/>During the post-moult summer period Seals rarely haul out, spending several months at sea feeding. In late autumn the breeding adults gather in the northeast, hauling out on sandy islands and reed beds in increasing numbers until ice begins to form (Krylov 1990). When the surface freezes over, females form aggregations on the ice to give birth to their pups, tending to gather along cracks in the ice giving them ready access to the water, although like Ringed Seals they also construct and maintain holes in the ice for water access (Heptner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Diving capacity for Caspian Seals is comparable to other small phocids, with maximum dive depths exceeding 200 m and dive times exceeding 20 minutes, but most dives are typically shallower than 15 m and shorter than 5 minutes. During the summer foraging areas are not limited by proximity to haul out sites, and animals may spend up to six months at sea. Foraging appears to be primarily benthic (Dmitrieva 2013).<br/><br/>Caspian Seals feed on a variety of fish species. During the summer and autumn, Seals move to and congregate where prey are abundant, particularly Caspian Kilka (<em>Clupeonella </em>sp.), Caspian Silverside (<em>Atherina mochon</em>), and Caspian Gobies (<em>Gobidae</em>) (Krylov 1990), with <em>Clupeonella </em>species historically making up a major proportion of their total annual diet (Kosarev and Yablonskaya 1994). A report on fish found in the stomachs of Seals in the northern Caspian in 1986-1987 (Piletskii and Krylov 1990) suggested that fish eaten in order of frequency were Roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>), Zander (<em>Lucioperca lucioperca</em>), Gobies (<em>Knipowitschia </em>sp., <em>Neogobius kessleri</em> and <em>Benthophilus </em>sp.), and Bream (<em>Blicca bjoerkna </em>and <em>Abramis brama</em>), followed by C. deliculata and other species. A preliminary study from faecal samples collected on the Apsheron Peninsula in June 2001 and March 2002 suggested that Gobies, Silverside, and shrimp were important constituents of the diet of Seals at those times (Eybatov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). New studies of diet in Caspian Seals are required in order to get an accurate picture of current prey in different areas of the Caspian in light of potential changes to the abundance of fish species due to recent ecological changes occurring in the region.","Unsustainable hunting was the main driver of Caspian Seal decline during the 20th century (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012), and human caused mortality continues to be the main ongoing threat to the population. Recently, by-catch of Seals, primarily in illegal Sturgeon fisheries has been identified as a major cause of Seal mortality (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on semi-structured interviews conducted in fishing communities from Dagestan (Russia), Astrakhan region (Russia), and Atyrau region (Kazakhstan), Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2013) documented a minimum by-catch of 1,215 Seals during the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93% of which occurred in illegal Sturgeon fisheries. However, the study sampling reflected less than 10% of the overall poaching activity in the north Caspian, so the actual by-catch is likely to be substantially higher, and to exceed the Potential Biological Removal level (Wade <em>et al.</em> 1998) for the population (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Moreover, the survey did not cover fisheries in the middle and southern Caspian. Iranian commercial fisheries cause an estimated mortality of 500 Seals annually (Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). Further work is needed to fully quantify Seal by-catch rates throughout the Caspian Sea, and its implications for population demography. Fishermen frequently sell skins and blubber from bycaught Seals.<br/><br/>Natural sources of mortality include predation and disease. The primary non-human predators are Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Sea Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus </em>spp.). Krylov (1990) estimated that Wolves killed 17-40% of Caspian Seal pups on “some breeding grounds from 1974 to 1976”, while Eagles took less than 1% of pups. The reverse was found during recent aerial surveys (Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). Few Wolves were observed each year between 2005-2012, but up to 3,100 Eagles. Eagles are likely to primarily scavenge afterbirth and dead pups, but may also be capable of killing unaccompanied unweaned pups.<br/><br/>Mass mortality events occurred in 1997 and 2000-2001, killing several thousand Seals each time, and have since been attributed to canine distemper virus (CDV). Presence of a hitherto unknown strain of CDV was confirmed in one dead Seal in 1997 (Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 1998), and the same strain was confirmed as the primary cause of death in Seals dying in 2000 in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Examination of archived stranding records in Azerbaijan since 1971, show an increased mortality every few years, suggesting the possibility of previous outbreaks of CDV (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). A serology study of archived samples indicated that CDV was present in Caspian Seals in 1993, 1997, and 1998 (Ohashi <em>et al.</em> 2001). There have been no further mass mortalities since 2001, but disease would become a concern should they reoccur.<br/><br/>Degradation of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and overexploitation of primary food resources may also be threats to Caspian Seals (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Barannik <em>et al.</em> 2004). An invasive of Comb Jellyfish, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, arrived in the Caspian Sea via ship ballast water in the Volga-Don Canal in 1999 (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000). Comb Jellyfish consume zooplankton rapidly, leading indirectly to a reduction in fish stocks and a substantial impact on local fisheries. A 70% reduction in commercial landings of three species of Kilka was recorded within three years of the Comb Jellyfish invasion (Kideys <em>et al.</em> 2005). Kilka are thought to be important prey for Caspian Seals in the central and southern parts of the sea, and the invasion of Comb Jellyfish is considered a threat to the Seals (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). In addition to impacts from Comb Jellyfish, most commercial fisheries in the Caspian are considered to be severely depleted or extinct due to unsustainable fishing practices and/or loss of fish habitats such as spawning grounds (Strukova and Guchgeldiyev 2010). While Caspian Seals are known to feed to on commercially important fish species, commercial catch rates are not necessarily an indicator of prey availability, and Seals have a varied and adaptable diet which includes non-commercial species such as Gobies. To date is has not been possible to make any quantitative assessment on potential impacts from changes in Caspian food webs and Caspian Seal energetics and demography. Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2015) did not find a significant correlation when testing for association between annual pup production and net primary productivity 2005-2012, but a longer time series of surveys is required to achieve adequate statistical power.<br/><br/>The Caspian Sea has no outlet and receives most of its input from the Volga, Ural, and other rivers. Contamination of the Volga with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, but levels in Seals do not appear to be elevated, with the exception of zinc in some diseased animals that may have suffered homeostatic disturbance of trace metal levels (Anan <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Organochlorine levels (principally polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs)) have been assessed for Caspian Seals dying in the 1997-2001 CDV epizootics (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1999; Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2008; Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most animals were found to have levels below thresholds believed to cause toxic effects in mammals. Overall levels in Caspian Seals were lower than those seen in European Seal species, comparable to Baikal Seals, and higher than those reported for Arctic species (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Presently there is no evidence that organochlorine burdens in Caspian Seals cause reproductive or immune impairment, or contributed to the 1997-2001 CDV outbreaks at a population level, although some individual Seals may have high burdens (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002,&#160;Härkönen&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Organochlorine accumulation was found to be primarily age related, which means animals at the older end of the age distribution may be at risk of crossing toxicity thresholds towards the end of their reproductive lifespan (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has been recommended that levels of persistent organic pollutants should be monitored in the future due to the continuing industrial development around the Caspian region and time elapsed since the last survey following the CDV epizootics (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Combined juvenile mortality from continued hunting, natural predation, and fisheries by-catch is believed to be unsustainable. Overall mortality before breeding from all sources is likely to be in the region of 50% (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Demographic models indicate such a high rate of juvenile mortality would be capable of causing a continuing decline in the Caspian Seal population, with lowered fertility due to organochlorine contamination being a relatively minor factor (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Variation in annual pup production determined from aerial surveys makes empirical estimation of current population trends uncertain (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b), and a longer time series is necessary to assess the demographic trajectory directly.<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species with no option to migrate to alternative habitats, Caspian Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). Warming may cause a reduction in the spatial extent, temporal duration, and stability of the winter ice breeding habitat. Premature break-up of the ice sheet before pups are moulted will cause significant mortality among pups of the year. January-March 2007 was one of the mildest winters in the Caspian in recent years, with ice cover suitable for breeding limited to a narrow strip along the coastline of the north-east Caspian. Storms in mid-February may have caused ice-flows with large numbers of pups to be swept out to sea, and pup counts for that year were less than one third the maximum observed for 2005-2012 (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). It has also been suggested that poor ice conditions may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV outbreaks due to Seal crowding on limited haulout space and poor condition of weaned pups (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Long term trends in Caspian Sea ice cover and the implications for population demography remain to be fully assessed.<br/><br/>Through the geological history of the Caspian, there have been several substantial fluctuations of sea level (Dumont 1998), which will have affected the relative amounts of shallow and deep water habitats available to Seals. The population adapted to those past changes, but there is some concern about whether the same will be possible for future sea level changes given added pressures of habitat loss and human impacts.<br/><br/>Further threats to the Seals on shore and on ice now come from increasing disturbance due to offshore and shoreline developments. One of the largest oil fields in the world is currently being developed in the Caspian, with the construction of numerous offshore oil drilling islands, pipelines, shipping access to these, and onshore logistics facilities. A recent study found that breeding Seals are using shipping channels as artificial leads into the ice and are giving birth close to the edge of these channels. A significant proportion of the breeding population and pups may therefore experience disturbance by shipping traffic depending on the ice conditions (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). More research is required to quantify the likely impacts of this intensive oil development. The coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran have also seen increased development for domestic and leisure use in recent years, with many previously undisturbed stretches of coast now being developed.<br/><br/>Disturbance of island and reef haulout sites by illegal fishing activities and opportunistic Seal hunting are another ongoing problem. Recent surveys have found that the Caspian Seal has effectively disappeared from Azerbaijan, with the once important haulout sites of the Apsheron Peninsula and Archipelago abandoned. These sites were used by many thousands of Seals until the 1930s when they were heavily hunted (Krylov 1990). However, between 1997 and 2002 a few hundred Seals were still counted regularly at these sites (e.g., Allchin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Few live Seals have been seen in this area since 2004 (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). The overall Caspian Seal population decline since 2002 is unlikely to account for this total disappearance, which is most probably due in part to severe disturbance by illegal fishing and other coastal activities (T. Eybatov, unpublished data). Similar declines in the regularity of Seal occupancy have also been noted recently at other sites, such as South West Island near the Ural Delta and Osushnoy Island (Kazakhstan), Bautino (Kazakhstan), and in Turkmenbashi Bay (Turkmenistan). The number of Seals at Ogurchinsky Island (Turkmenistan) has also declined from several thousand in the 1980s to a few hundred (P. Erokhin, unpublished observations). The only previously recorded haulout site in Iran, at Ashoora Island, is no longer used by Seals (H. Asadi pers. comm.). There is a need to develop an inventory of all haulout sites throughout the Caspian together with archived and current records of Seal occupancy (Wilson and Goodman 2012).","Historically, the population of Caspian Seals was estimated to have exceeded one million (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). The most recent estimates of abundance are based on aerial surveys of the breeding population on the northern ice field conducted annually in February between 2005 and 2012 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). During this period estimated annual pup production ranged between 8,200 (95% confidence intervals 7,130-9,342) and 34,000 (95% confidence intervals 31,275-36,814). This would suggest there are currently approximately 68,000 reproductively mature individuals (male and female, based on the greatest observed pup production), with the total population in the region of 104,000 to 168,000 individuals derived from an age structured model (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2012; Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). Variation in weather conditions during surveys may account for some of difference in pup counts between years, but additional contributions from biological factors affecting fecundity cannot be excluded at this time (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). The variability in annual pup makes the current population trend uncertain, and a longer time series is necessary to directly assess the demographic trajectory (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). However, if pup mortality exceeds 50% due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes (a realistic scenario), this could be sufficient to result in ongoing declines (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>The population decline throughout the 20th century has been reconstructed by a demographic model using hunting statistics. By the 1950s–1960s, the population was estimated from this model to have been reduced to between 400,000-500,000 Seals (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), while an estimate based on a harvest of 86,000 pups in 1966, believed to be most pups born that year, also produced an estimate of 500,000 Seals for that year (Krylov 1990). Aerial surveys conducted in 1976 and 1980 suggested an estimate of 450,000 animals (Krylov 1990), although the hind-casting analysis suggests a population of only about 200,000 Seals remaining at that time (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Surveys in 1987 and 1989 resulted in an estimate of approximately 360,000-400,000 (Krylov 1990), but again the hind-casting analysis suggests this might again have been an over-estimate, with perhaps only about 130,000 Seals remaining by the late 1980s. Overall, the hind-casting analysis indicated a population reduction of about 66% during 1867-1964 and a further reduction of 73% during 1965-2005 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) estimated the total population of adult females as 354,210 in 1945 and 21,000 in 2005, later revised to 34,000 by Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015b) after accounting for survey observation errors. Although pup production has been revised upwards in more recent publications, this would not affect the relative decline, since it would imply correspondingly higher historical population sizes. The IUCN Criterion A calculator was used to project declines over a three generation period 1955-2015, indicating adult female numbers declined 91.5%. However, the scale of decline is dependent on estimated values for parameters such as pup survival and fertility rates, about which there is some uncertainty (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Therefore a more conservative position for the purposes of IUCN classification would be to accept a relative decline of at least 70% until more data are available to refine the historical demography.<br/><br/>Generation time from Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) is 18.8 years.",Unknown,"Caspian Seals are confined to the Caspian Sea. They range throughout the sea with seasonal migration between the southern, middle, and northern basins. More than 99.9% of breeding takes place on ice, which covers the shallow northern parts of the Caspian Sea in from late December to early April in typical years (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013, Dmitrieva <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015a). Occasional observations have been made of low numbers (a few tens of individuals) breeding on islets off Turkmenistan (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013).","Caspian Seals have been commercially exploited since the late 18th century. Harvests averaged 119,000-174,000 per year throughout the 19th century, with peaks of 300,000 having been recorded. In the 20th century, harvest levels peaked in the 1930s with an average annual harvest of 164,000 and a maximum single year take of 227,600. The numbers of Seals taken fell during World War II to an average of 60,800 per year, and subsequently ranged between a low of 41,400 and a high of 108,300 for the period 1951-1975 (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Commercial harvesting was temporarily halted in 1996 after a much-reduced estimated take of 14,000 Seals. Since the start of the 21st century smaller scale commercial and scientific hunting has taken place in Russia, typically with recorded hunts of tens or hundreds of individuals per year, with a maximum of 4,600 (in 2003-2004), reported for the period up to 2010. Official hunting is conducted under a quota system administered by an inter-governmental body, the Caspian Bioresources Commission. Typical annual quotas are for 18,000 Seals, with 8,000 allocated to Russia, and the remainder divided among the other Caspian states. The scientific rationale for the quotas is not clear. Currently only Russia actively pursues official hunting under the quota, but large scale hunting does not appear to be commercially viable at present and recorded takes are far below the official quota levels (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). The level of ‘unofficial’ or illegal hunting is poorly documented, but illegal hunting on ice on the scale of hundreds of Seals is known to take place periodically (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Seal skins are used for hats and other clothing in Russia, while Seal blubber is used as a medicinal tonic, fishing bait, and cattle feed in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The total economic value and trading networks for Seal products remain to be fully determined, but high quality individual seal skins may sell for up to $100 US dollars at the point of origin, while seal oil can sell for $14.00 per litre in local markets (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Various prohibitions, quotas, and protective measures have been taken to conserve the Caspian Seal, beginning in 1940 when seal nets were prohibited. The harvest of moulting Seals in the spring was ended in 1946, and in 1952 the Apsheron Archipelago in Azerbaijan was closed to sealing. Female harvesting on the breeding grounds was stopped in 1966 and all take was prohibited on the eastern islands of the northern Caspian in 1967. These last two changes led to a complete change in the commercial harvest, resulting in a switch to newborn and moulted pups. Quotas on harvest of pups, purportedly based on biological data, began in 1970 (Krylov 1990), although in retrospect the quotas were at unsustainable levels. The Russian Federation continues to consider the Caspian Seal to be a ‘harvested’ species, with quotas set through the Caspian Bioresources Commission (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2012).<br/><br/>A Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan was approved by the nations bordering the Caspian Sea, pursuant to the 2003 Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Caspian Environment Programme 2007), but it had no legally binding actions. The action plan recommended cessation of hunting, measures to reduce by-catch in legal and illegal fisheries, and the strategic creation of protected areas of sea, ice, and shore. However, to date none of the Caspian states have taken steps to implement the action plan. In 2012 the CaspEco Project, a UNDP funded follow up to the Caspian Environment Programme, published a framework report and road map for the establishment of a network of protected areas for Caspian Seals, including suitable locations (Wilson and Goodman 2012), but no further action has yet taken place. A number of small non-governmental organizations within Caspian countries are involved in producing educational materials and promoting awareness of Caspian Seals.

At present, poaching is a minor problem but still occurs, particularly south of 43°S latitude where control of hunting is difficult to implement. Extirpation of the Southern River Otter began in local basins but has become widespread. The lack of re-establishment of the species is probably due to high mortality or reproductive failure following the dispersal of otters into unsuitable areas (Medina 1996). This is resulting in a population that is becoming increasingly fragmented and more susceptible to local extinctions through habitat destruction, human disturbance, predation by domestic dogs, and demographic or environmental stochastic events. Genetic studies have confirmed a lower genetic diversity in the northern freshwater subpopulations in comparison to those from the south confirming a past bottleneck probably due to anthropogenic factors (Centron <em>et al.</em> 2008,&#160;Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species has suffered a suspected past population decline of ≥50% over the last 30 years or three generations (based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) in its range countries due to habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, overhunting for the pelt trade, and direct persecution due to retaliation (Chehébar 1990).

Therefore, based on the suspected population decline in the past and future, the species is categorised as Endangered under criteria A2cd+3cde.</p>","<p>The Southern River Otter is distributed in the southern temperate forest of South America. This species presents a distribution associated with inland waters in the northern parts of its range, and marine habitat in the southern part of its range. In freshwater habitats otters are associated with the presence of macro-crustaceans from the genus <em>Aegla spp.</em> and <em>Sammastacus spp. </em>(Aued <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al.</em> 2009,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al. </em>2009), which are the otter’s main prey (Medina 1997,&#160;Medina-Vogel and Gonzalez-Lagos 2008,&#160;Fasola <em>et al. </em>2009,&#160;Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011,&#160;Franco <em>et al. </em>2013). Other species of crustaceans, fish and amphibians are also in the otter’s diet but are of marginal occurrence. The species uses rivers with abundant vegetation (Chehebar <em>et al.</em> 1986,&#160;Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2003) and inhabit diverse types of wetlands including Andean lakes, rivers of different sizes, ponds and estuaries. A study using telemetry described an average home range of 11.3 km, with solitary behaviour and a low spatial overlap between individuals of same sex suggesting intrasexual territoriality (Sepúlveda <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the marine range the species uses the marine rocky coast with abundant vegetation cover and low exposure to wind and waves (Sielfeld 1992,&#160;Sielfeld and Castilla 1999). In this environment the Southern River Otter is sympatric with the Marine Otter (<em>L. felina</em>), but the latter is segregated by its use of more wave-exposed coastal areas (Sielfeld 1992,&#160;Ebensperger and Botto-Mahan 1997). The diet in the marine environment is composed of coastal fish of the genera <em>Harpagifer</em>, <em>Patagonotothen</em>, <em>Eleginops</em>, <em>Cottoperca</em> and crustaceans of the genera <em>Munida, Taliepus, Cancridae, Galatheidae, Lithodidae, Lithodes, Paralomis </em>and<em> Campylonotus&#160;</em>(Sielfeld and Castilla 1999,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2013). In general, for both marine and inland waters the Southern River Otter seems to be a specialized aquatic bottom forager preying on slow benthic fish and crustaceans.</p>","The Southern River Otter habitat is very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts (Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). In those subpopulations inhabiting freshwater environments, the high demand for water by human activities such as agriculture, human use, etc. is altering watercourses through canalization and drainage and loss of riparian vegetation. These activities are promoted to increase the amount of agricultural lands but are impacting those otter subpopulations distributed in lowlands, particularly in the Central Valley and the Coastal Range of Chile (Medina-Vogel&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003,&#160;Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). In the case of Andean lakes, where the species occurred historically, the high level of urbanization and tourism has been proposed as the main causes responsible for the local extinction of the species in those areas (Medina 1996). Other threats are poaching (Medina 1996,&#160;Espinosa 2012), predation by free-ranging domestic dogs (Espinosa 2012) and transmission of diseases such as Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014). Free-ranging dogs are an important threat to carnivores because of predation and disease transmission (Vanak and Gompper 2009), and are present in rural and protected areas where the Southern River Otter occurs (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Implementing dog population control measures as well as vaccination programmes are an important measure to mitigate the impact of dogs on this species (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In several parts of the otter's distribution range, hydroelectric dams are installed or are planned to be built in the near future but no research on the potential impact of these on the otters has been conducted so far. The presence of wild exotic salmon and the salmon farming industry are suggested as a potential threat to otter prey leading to potential competition between otters and salmon (Medina 1996,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009) but no studies have confirmed this as yet. In relation to the invasive American Mink (<em>Neovison vison</em>), although several studies have investigated competition between these mustelids and river otters (Medina 1997,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Fasola <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013), there is no clear evidence of a negative effect of the mink on the otter. Indeed, current studies in the marine part of the range suggest a negative effect of otters over minks by habitat (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013) and temporal segregation (Medina‐Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2013). The invasive mink is a potential vector of CDV to otters given their behavioural similarities and sharing of latrines (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Most studies on this species have been made based on indirect signs of the species, hence, there are no estimates of population or subpopulation size. The freshwater subpopulations have been studied more than those in marine environments. Monitoring of signs such as spraints or tracks has been implemented particularly for the population in Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina by the Administration of National Parks for over 30 years (Chehebar 1985, Chehebar <em>et al</em>. 1986, Chehébar and Porro 1998, Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pozzi and Chehebar 2013). A relatively stable otter distribution has been observed in this area with some marginal expansion outside the Nahuel Huapi Park in the Limay River (Carmanchahi <em>et al</em>. 2006). In this population recent volcanic activity during 2011 could have disrupted freshwater ecosystems, consequently affecting the otter population, but there are no studies on the subject, which are of utmost urgency.<br/> <br/> Freshwater subpopulations have been described as fragmented and comprised of seven isolated subpopulations (Medina 1996) but subsequent surveys have identified presence in areas previously thought not to have otters (Rodríguez<em> et al</em>. 2008); it is not clear if this is the result of a recent recolonization or sampling bias in earlier studies, and more research is needed. A radio-telemetry study in the Queule River found densities of 0.25 otters/km of river (Sepúlveda<em> et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Studies of the marine population in Chile indicate that the otter distribution in this environment would be continuous and abundances estimated are 0.57 otters/km of coast (Sielfeld 1992). Studies based on indirect signs in marine populations in Argentina, indicate two separate subpopulations, one in Isla de Los Estados (Provincial Reserve) and the other in Bahia Lapataia, Tierra del Fuego National Park, in the Beagle Channel (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> During 1910–1954 a total of 38,263 otter pelts (<em>Lontra felina</em> and <em>L. provocax</em>) were exported from Chile but after that period no exports exist due to the implementation of different laws and international agreements (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986).",Decreasing,"The Southern River Otter occurs in Chile and Argentina in freshwater and marine environments. The freshwater distribution is located in the northern part of the otter’s range and was historically wider in both countries. In Chile, river otters occurred from Cachapoal River (34ºS) (Gay 1847, Reed 1877) up to the Peninsula de Taitao (46ºS) with a continuous distribution in rivers and lakes (Medina 1996). The current distribution in Chile has been strongly restricted from north to south due to land use change and human colonization (Medina 1996), as a consequence, the otter populations are only found at present from the Imperial River (38ºS) (Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011) to the south. &#160;In Argentina freshwater subpopulations were distributed historically from the Neuquen Province (36ºS) to the Lake Buenos Aires (46ºS) and mostly associated with water courses from the Andean Range and the steppe (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012). The present freshwater distribution in Argentina is mostly restricted to the Limay watershed, mainly within the Nahuel Huapi National Park (Chehebar 1985, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Southern River Otter subpopulations that inhabit marine environments are distributed along the Pacific coast of Chile from 46ºS to Tierra del Fuego in Chile (Cabrera 1957, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Sielfeld 1992, Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Argentina, marine subpopulations are present only in the Archipielago Fueguino in Los Estados Island and the Beagle Channel (Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006, Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2012, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). Marine river otters in Argentina are probably a continuous subpopulation of the main otter subpopulation in Chile (Sielfeld 1992).",The species is hunted for their pelts which are used to make clothing.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The Southern River Otter is listed on CITES Appendix I and listed on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Appendix I.<br/> <br/> In Chile, the conservation status is listed by the Reglamento de Clasificación de Especies as Endangered in VI, VII, VIII, IX, XIV and X Districts and as Data Deficient in XI and XII Districts (Chile 2011). In Chile, the Subsecretaria de Pesca is the governmental agency responsible of their conservation and management. In those populations inside official protected areas the Corporacion Nacional Forestal is responsible for their conservation. National Action plans in Chile are developed by the Minisiterio del MedioAmbiente, but despite its conservation status, no Action Plan exists for this species at present, which is the most urgent conservation action priority. Hunting is prohibited since 1929 in Chile (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986) and the governmental agency responsible for hunting permits and enforcement is the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero.<br/> <br/> In Argentina, the conservation status is Endangered (EN A3cd) (Valenzuela et al. 2012). At national level, the governmental agency responsible of native wildlife conservation and management is the Secretaría de Ambiente y DesarrolloSustentable de la Nación through the Dirección de Fauna Silvestre. The Administración de Parques Nacionales (National Parks Administration) is responsible for conservation of those populations inside the national protected areas, where the species is classified as Special Value Species (APN 1994.). The two populations in Argentina from freshwater and marine habitats are mostly inside national protected areas.<br/> Because of the several agencies involved in the management of the species a strong coordination with clear responsibilities and a work agenda is a major urgency in the short term. Actions recommended for both Chile and Argentina are:</p>  <ul>  <li>To develop a Conservation      Bi-National Plan for the species;</li>  <li>To develop specific National      Conservation Plans for each country;</li>  <li>To develop validated Monitoring      Programmes in protected and unprotected lands; particularly in Chile where      there is no such activity in any population; and</li>  <li>To reinforce the importance of environmental impact assessment      projects in relation to the species in order to adequately determine: a)      presence of otter population in areas of projects, and b) in those      projects requiring to implement adequate actions to incorporate: 1)      measures of monitoring, 2) mitigation and 3) compensation activities.</li> </ul>  <br/> There have not been any reintroduction attempts, which could be an appropriate conservation action considering the success of such plans in North American and European species.

The species is considered extinct on Martinique and intensive targeted surveys have failed to record any evidence that snakes survive on Rocher du Diamant. While experts searching for this species have concluded that it is probably now extinct, there are recent anecdotal reports of snakes on Rocher du Diamant and a small part of the island was inaccessible to surveyors, so a it is possible that a very small number of individuals survive.","This species occurred in both mesic and arid habitats; on arid Rocher du Diamant it was found in thick vegetation. Historical records from Martinique include a range of habitats, including forest in the wettest part of the island (Dewynter <em>et al. </em>in press). It was presumably a ground-dwelling active forager that fed on lizards, frogs and insects. It was an egg laying species (Henderson and Powell 2009).","This species was rapidly lost from Martinique following the introduction of mongoose in the 1870s, although a population survived until at least 1965 when the animal was last recorded. The cause of the species' apparent extinction on Rocher du Diamant is less clear, as the islet is too small to sustain a mongoose population and rats appear never to have been present (Caut and Jowers 2016). Contributing factors may include invasive house mice (which appear to occur on the islet at high densities - Caut and Jowers 2016), stochastic effects and the impacts of inbreeding, and declines may have been exacerbated by a mid-20th Century local tradition of removing snakes from the island and releasing them on Martinique, which is no longer suitable for the snake's persistence. The islet may not have been large enough to support a viable population based on comparisons with the Saint Lucia racer, whose global population size of fewer than 30 individuals is thought to be close to the carrying capacity of a larger islet off the coast of Saint Lucia (J. Daltry pers. comm. 2015). The exact causes of the species' apparent extinction on&#160;Rocher du Diamant are particularly difficult to determine given that, while it appears to have persisted on this islet from at least the 18th Century to as late as the early 1960s, nothing is recorded of any changes in abundance between these two periods or of any novel pressures acting on the islet (Caut and Jowers 2016).","The species was reported to be common across Martinique before 1879 (Dewynter&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>in press), however, it has never since been recorded from this island's north and was last recorded from Martinique in 1965. It has almost certainly been lost from Martinique. If it is still present on Rocher du Diamant, from which it was last recorded in 1968 (Breuil 2002) it is at a very low population density (Powell and Henderson 2005, Henderson and Powell 2009). Although historical reports indicate that it was abundant here in the 18th Century nothing is reported of its abundance or population trends on the islet since, however, comparison with congeners suggests that the island may never have supported a population in excess of 50 individuals (Caut and Jowers 2016). A targeted survey was carried out on&#160;Rocher du Diamant, involving two researchers surveying both visually and with snake-specific intercept traps between 4 and 14 June 2014 (Caut and Jowers 2016). This effort failed to record any evidence that the species still exists, with no records of either individuals, eggs, or skins although the traps successfully recorded every reptile species known to survive on the island (Caut and Jowers 2016). Although these authors conclude that the species is probably extinct, they note that some areas of the islet were inaccessible to their survey on logistical grounds.",Unknown,"This snake is known only from Martinique and the 0.06 km<sup>2</sup> satellite of Rocher du Diamant (Henderson and Powell 2009). It was last recorded on the main island in 1965 (and the last record from the northern part of the island was in 1879), and from Rocher du Diamant in 1968. It is presumed to be extinct on Martinique, where many years of intensive searches have failed to record it (M.

There are, however, credible anecdotal reports of early-morning sightings as late as 2015 (M.

Its future on one island, in particular, is precarious, and the overall population trend is uncertain. The discovery of a relatively large population on Fogo, where it occurs commonly in plantations and crops, suggests that it may be less threatened than previously feared, and a re-assessment of its extent of occurrence using a minimum convex polygon means that the species now warrants listing as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","Its original habitat was probably scrub on mountain slopes and reedbeds in valleys (Hazevoet 1993)<strong></strong>.

In addition, disease and enviromental catastrophies are potential threats to these island populations (Hazevoet <em>et al.</em> 1999). A recent forest fire on Fogo destroyed a large part of inaccessible forest where the species possibly existed (H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016), and so forest fires, and any future increase in fire frequency could be very harmful to this species. The removal of invasive plant species, such as reed removal by farmers on S. Nicolau, could possibly reduce the available habitat for this species in areas where there is no natural habitat (H.

However, conservative estimates of 500 pairs on Fogo mean that the total population is likely to be higher, likely numbering 1,500-2,000 mature individuals, roughly equivalent to 2,200-3,000 individuals in total. &#160;Full censuses were never carried on Fogo or Santiago. The numbers on Santiago could be higher than previously thought because the bird is now known to occur in all vegetated areas of the island, whereas in the 1990s it was thought to be absent from the north of the island (H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016). On Fogo, a volcanic eruption in 2014 does not seem to have affected the extent of area occupied by the bird, but the bird is absent from areas where it had been previously found on the forest of Monte Velha following the forest fire of 2015. However, the size of the birds’ territories is unknown, and could be larger than in closely related species; this means that the numbers estimated based on replies to playbacks may or may not correspond to the actual numbers (in recent surveys, the same colour-ringed bird replied to playback lures from locations that could have considered two adjacent territories [H. Batalha <em>in litt. </em>2016]). Surveys on S.

It has most likely died out on Brava (no records since 1969 and formerly scarce) and was believed to have died out on São Nicolau (where it was formerly numerous). However, a previously unreported specimen collected on São Nicolau in October 1970 was discovered in the collection of the Centro de Zoologia, Lisbon, providing the impetus for a thorough search of the island (Hazevoet 1999a)<strong></strong> and, in 1998, surveys located eight territories confined to the north-west of the island (though its long-term prospects for survival here are poor) (Hazevoet <em>et al.</em> 1999).

On Santiago, it can be found in densely vegetated areas across the island, between 6 and 1,039 m, and in various habitats, from lowland plantations (e.g., Praia, Cidade Velha, Chão Bom, Achada Tenda, Pedra Babejo) to mountain forests (Serra Malagueta and Monte Tchota), and sugar cane plantations in Praia to <em>Prosopis spp.</em> shrub thickets in Tarrafal (Batalha<em> et al.</em> unpublished data).

This may involve investigating the species’s association with dams, which are currently being built on several locations on Santiago, and its association&#160;with invasive plant species (e.g.,&#160;<em>Lantana, Furcrarea, Arundo, Prosopis spp.</em>); which should be considered when planning conservation actions aimed at eradicating invasive species (as previously done on Natural Park of Serra Malagueta) (H.

For this reason it is listed as Endangered.<p></p>,"It mostly inhabits high-altitude forest and alpine basins, although birds will often frequent and nest in coastal lowland flats. Its foraging habitat includes all types of native forest, sub-alpine scrub, tussock and herb-field. It mostly feeds on berries and shoots, although many have adapted to feeding at refuse dumps and ski-fields. It nests in holes, under logs or in rocky crevasses, mainly within forest. It usually incubates up to four eggs. Males feed the females during incubation and after hatching. Birds breed after three or more years.

Orr-Walker <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","Up until its partial protection in the early 1970s, over 150,000 were shot in a bounty scheme, established because rogue individuals were found to be attacking sheep as a source of fat.

Introduced mammalian predators such as stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em>, cats and brush-tailed possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em> have spread into most of the species's range. Episodic, high mortality events are thought to be associated with “plagues” of stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> which occur after mast seeding of native beech and rimu (Kemp 2013). Monitoring by the Department of Conservation between 2009-2014 found that only 2% of kea nests in areas without pest control were successful, in contrast with a 27% success rate&#160;in areas treated with aerial 1080 in 2015 (Department of Conservation 2016). It is estimated that around 60% of kea nests are normally attacked by predators, especially stoats, which may also kill adults; this can rise to as many as 99% of nests being attacked in a stoat “plague” (Department of Conservation 2016). Birds are sometimes killed through accidents with human objects (e.g. motor vehicles, snow groomers, rubbish bins, electricity sub-stations) (Orr-Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).

Identify sources of lead posing a risk to kea, then either remove, replace with lead free alternatives or cover to prevent kea access (Orr-Walker 2013a). Ensure that kea are excluded from predator-control toxins and devices, and limit the use of risky devices (Orr-Walker 2013b).

Historically, the population size of the species is inferred to have declined based on the 77% decline in the extent of occurrence (EOO) of the distributional records in the Atlas of Living Australia. However, this does not match the three generation time period required for criterion A. The population has not recovered to its historical levels. Recent progress has been made through the establishment of new self-sustaining populations from stocked hatchery fish. The current area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at 688 km<sup>2</sup>. The remaining six subpopulations represent individual threat-based locations. There is a continuing decline projected in habitat quality as invasive species continue to establish and spread throughout the range of Trout Cod, and many of the existing threats that are inferred to have caused the species decline are still active (floodplain alienation, dams, thermal pollution, water extraction). Recent genetic investigations have demonstrated hybridisation (as larvae) between stocked Trout Cod and Murray Cod (Couch <em>et al. </em>2016). It is unknown to what extent these larval hybrids persist or breed in the population but fertile F1 hybrid backcrosses have been demonstrated (Couch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Higher rates of hybridisation between these two species have also occurred in Cataract Dam (Koehn <em>et al. </em>2013) and in the Upper Murray catchment (Jason Lieschke pers. comm.).","<strong>Ecology<br/><br/></strong>The Trout Cod is an elongate, streamlined, moderately large percoid fish with a typically blue-grey colouration on the back and sides, becoming paler, almost white, on the ventral surface of the abdomen. This colouration is overlain by darker spots, blotches and irregular lines on the back and sides, but which are largely absent on the forehead and snout. Fins are blue-grey, with the tail, soft dorsal, anal and pelvic fins frequently with white margins. In profile, the head is straight, the top jaw overhangs the lower jaw, and a dark eye stripe extends from the snout horizontally through the eye to the operculum. Trout Cod grow to a maximum of about 850 mm in length and 16 kg in weight (Lake 1971), but are now usually smaller (&lt; 5 kg; Lintermans 2007). The maximum age is unknown but estimated to be about 30 y (Todd <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is however, considerable evidence of fish being much larger (and hence older) in the past prior to major declines (Trueman 2011) and so maximum age is likely to be and underestimate.<br/><br/>Douglas <em>et. al. </em>(1994) considered that Trout Cod, like captive Murray Cod, formed pairs and spawned annually, usually in spring (September to November) and probably in response to increasing day-length and water temperature. Trout Cod breeding appears to be stimulated by a rise in water temperature to between 15°C and 20°C in October-November (G. Gooley in Koehn and O’Connor 1990, Koehn and Harrington 2006). The fertilised eggs of Trout Cod are adhesive, demersal, opaque and 2.5-3.6 mm in diameter (Ingram and Rimmer 1992). The adhesive properties of the eggs suggest that a hard substrate might be preferred as an egg-laying site and it is speculated that typical egg-laying sites would include on or in logs, amongst rocks, or on hard clay surfaces (Cadwallader 1979, Koehn and O'Connor 1990). The fecundity of Trout Cod ranged from 2,027 to 14,000 in the wild (Lyon <em>et al.</em> 2012). This is higher than the 1,200-11,300 eggs stripped from individual hatchery broodfish (Ingram and Rimmer 1992). Hatching commences 5-10 days after fertilisation at 20°C and is mostly completed 2-3 days later, though may occur for up to 10 days (Ingram and Rimmer 1992). Newly hatched larvae are 6.0-8.8 mm in length and begin feeding about 10 days after hatching. Larvae occur in the drift after hatching, with peak numbers in November (Koehn and Harrington 2006).<br/><br/>Trout Cod reach sexual maturity at 3-5 years, between 0.75 and 1.5 kg in weight, and at lengths as small as 35 cm for males and 43 cm for females (G. Gooley, in Koehn and O’Connor 1990), although fish as small as 25.4 cm have been reported in spawning condition (J.O. Langtry, in Cadwallader 1977). The smallest confirmed spawning female in the wild is 283 mm, 299 g and 5 years old (Lyon <em>et al. </em>2012). Generally male Trout Cod mature younger and smaller than females, although there would be some variation depending on environmental conditions and growth rate.<br/><br/>The Trout Cod is a carnivorous, top-order predator, and its diet includes freshwater crustaceans such as crayfish, yabbies and shrimps, as well as fish and aquatic insects (Cadwallader 1979). Trout Cod fry reared in fertilised earthen ponds feed on a wide range of zooplankton, particularly cladocerans and copepods, and aquatic insects.&#160; As a top order predator they are very aggressive and hence are particularly susceptible to capture by anglers.&#160;<br/><br/>Movements are limited, especially by adults, with high levels of site fidelity and most recolonization occurring through either juvenile movements or larval drift (Koehn and Harrington 2006, Koehn <em>et al.</em> 2008, Koehn and Nicol 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Habitat<br/><br/></strong>The Trout Cod is a riverine species, inhabiting a variety of flowing waters in the mid to upper reaches of rivers and streams with cover in the form of woody debris or boulders. The Murray River downstream from Yarrawonga Weir is a large (60-100 m wide), flowing and deep (&gt;3 m) river with a sand, silt and clay substrate, and contains abundant woody debris. Trout Cod have been detected from within, under or adjacent to snags (logs), branch piles and steep clay banks, usually in areas of relatively fast flowing current. Seven Creeks is a relatively narrow stream (5-7 m wide) having a rock, gravel and sand substrate, and pools (generally &lt;2 m deep) interspersed by rapids and cascades up to about 4 m in height. Larger Trout Cod are often found in the deeper pools but smaller fish have also been taken amongst boulders, under logs and other cover in shallower waters. Habitat preferences have been well documented in the Murray river and consist of high levels of woody habitat, located further from the bank and in faster water than the other large bodied fish species (Koehn and Nicol 2016).&#160; Trout cod are more commonly observed utilising mid-channel habitats (Growns <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lieschke <em>et al</em>. 2016), but the microhabitat types within habitat, such as hollows ad rootmass are also important. The interactions between habitat type and distance to bank contribute to habitat selection. Trout cod prefer habitats with hollow logs (Lieschke <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Based on&#160;Trout cod recovery team&#160;(2008) threats to this species include:<ul><li>Removal of snags, woody debris, rocks from potential habitat, especially mid-stream woody habitats.</li><li>Reduction in/alteration of flows, such as abstraction of water.</li><li>Barriers to migration/movement such as dams, weirs, causeways and levees.</li><li>Removal of riparian vegetation/habitat.</li><li>Increased siltation or sedimentation, including from fires (Lyon and O’Connor 2008).</li><li>Blackwater/hypoxic fish kills (King <em>et al. </em>2012).</li><li>Loss of larvae into irrigation channels and pumps, and damage passing over weirs (Baumgartner 2006, Baumgartner&#160;2009, King and O’Connor 2007).</li><li>Potential predators/competitors (especially Redfin Perch and trout).</li><li>Recreational fishing (e.g. incidental capture and release, misidentification) mortality.

Recent progress has been made through the establishment of new self-sustaining populations from stocked hatchery fish.</p>",Stable,"Trout Cod is endemic to the Murray-Darling River system in south-eastern Australia and was originally common and widespread with records from the Murray (SA and NSW), Murrumbidgee (NSW and ACT), Macquarie (NSW) and the Goulburn, Broken, Campaspe, Ovens, King, Buffalo and Mitta Mitta River systems (Vic). This distribution of this species is historically unclear due to past and current taxonomic confusion, as it was only formally described as a different species to Murray Cod in 1972 (Berra and Weatherley 1972) but the historic distribution was likely to have been much larger than previously thought (Trueman 2011). There are now only seven self-sustaining populations of Trout Cod remaining in the wild. The only remaining natural population is in the Murray River between Yarrawonga and Barmah State forest (approximately 200 km of river) (Cadwallader and Gooley 1984, Ingram <em>et al.</em> 1990, Douglas <em>et al.</em> 1994). Two historic translocated populations exist; Cataract Dam (NSW: which contains hybrids with Murray Cod) and a restricted reach (approximately 5 km; translocated early 1900s) of the small upper Seven Creeks below Polly McQuinns Weir (Vic) upstream of Euroa. Four additional stocked populations established from early 2000s are now self-reproducing. These are in the lower Ovens River, lower Goulburn River, mid-Murrumbidgee River, Bendora Dam (Cotter River). Small populations exist in the Upper Murray, mid-Macquarie and upper Macquarie catchments, though reproduction from these populations is uncertain. There are also a number of stockings that have been unsuccessful or have no longer persisted over the longer term (Koehn <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Five subadult/juvenile Trout cod have been recorded in Gunbower Creek in the pat fiver years (Jason Lieschke unpublished data). These are probably downstream dispersal of the Murray River population between Yarrawonga and Barmah.","Fishing of this species is currently prohibited in all but a few areas in NSW (Talbingo Dam) and Victoria where it is stocked for catch-and-release recreational fisheries in two small lakes (Sambell and Kerford). However, the species is commonly captured when anglers target Murray Cod and Golden Perch and accidental post-release mortalities occur. There is evidence from length-frequency data form the Murray River that they are probably being impacted by angler take.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is recognised as endangered by the EPBC Act 1999, the ACT Nature Conservation Act 1980, NSW Fisheries Management 1994, and threatened under the 1998 Victoria Fauna Guarantee Act.<br/><br/>There is an Australian Government and some state/territory government recovery plans for this species (ACT Government 2018), with small numbers of captive bred juveniles released into sites within their historical range (ACT Government 2018, Koehn <em>et al. </em>2013, Lintermans <em>et al.</em> 2018). The recent draft CAMS evaluation for Trout Cod in Victoria is Status: EN, listed under: B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v).<br/><br/>This species was once abundant in the Ovens River (Victoria), and was locally extinct by the 1980s. A captive breeding program was established in the 1980s in an attempt to re-introduce the species. In 1997, and in every following year to 2006, juvenile hatchery-reared Trout Cod were released into the river. In a recent paper, Lyon <em>et al.</em> (2012) report on the success of this program. Natural recruitment did not begin until almost five years after the restocking program began. The re-established Ovens River population has now grown, is self-sustaining, and is as genetically diverse as the last remaining natural population in the Murray River downstream of Lake Mulwala. This program may have been successful because fingerlings and one-year olds were re-introduced annually for 10 years, whereas shorter-term programs, in smaller waterways have had limited success. A dedicated conservation stocking program has not occurred in Victoria for the past decade.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

In-stream cover was limited and consisted of boulders, some bank undercutting and associated root masses, and sparse woody debris. Specimens collected by electrofishing during the day were almost always associated with these cover elements. Specimens collected at night were often observed high in the water column in open water about 1 m from the bank. Snorkelling surveys revealed that <em>M. wujalwujalensis</em> was distributed over a wide range of depths. Fish were observed at depths of 4 m but were always within 0.5 m of the bottom.

Their introduction to the Bloomfield River could lead to a very rapid decline in the number of immature and mature individuals (through competition and/or predation). The risk of translocating native fish is exemplified by the known translocation of <em>Tandanus tropicanus</em> which is now abundant in this part of the river (B. Ebner pers. comm. 2019). The implications of this translocation is not yet known. In addition at least one attempt to translocate Sooty Grunter to this river has been made but this was not successful.

It is common and locally abundant in parts of its range. The species' close association with kelp in addition to its limited dispersal due to viviparity make impacts from kelp loss likely. Declines in kelp biomass have been directly observed in several parts of its range, including declines off Vancouver since about 2009 and severe declines in Northern California since about 2011. The primary driver of this decline is warming waters due to climate change, both natural and anthropogenic-influenced. Overgrazing by abnormally large populations of sea urchin is also a significant stressor. The impact of these declines on the global population of this species is poorly understood due to the lack of direct population studies, but some research is currently underway. At least one localized experimental study observed recruitment and density declines of this species following kelp removal. Due to the documented declines in kelp within this species' range, which has a close association with kelp for habitat and food, but high level of uncertainty regarding the impact of this potential major threat, <em>Brachyistius frenatus</em> is listed as Data Deficient.

It is also often quite abundant among eelgrass and surfgrass, and occasionally over boulders and even sand channels (M. Love pers. comm. 2019). Juveniles tend to aggregate in schools directly below the kelp canopy, while older individuals are less gregarious and more uniformly distributed along the kelp columns to the bottom (Anderson 1994, Hobson and Chess 2001). This species plays an important role in the maintenance of its habitat because it feeds on small, mobile invertebrates on and around kelp (Davenport and Anderson 2007).&#160;</p><p>This species gives birth to live young. During the Fall, between September and December, adults mate and females store the sperm in their ovarian cavity for several months. Fertilization, maturation and hatching takes place in the ovarian cavity, and from June to August, embryos are born as juveniles. Its fecundity is lower than most oviparous teleosts, but relatively large compared to other surfperches, where it produces 2-50 young (Baltz 1984, Wang 1986). It attains sexual maturity within one year of age, longevity is no more than 2 or 3 years (Hubbs and Hubbs 1954, Anderson 1994, Wang 1986) and generation length is approximately one year (Tocts <em>et al.</em> 2016). Its maximum total length is 21 cm (Hobson and Chess 2001).</p>","This species is probably&#160;impacted by declines in kelp,&#160;which is caused primarily by anomalous warm water events influenced by both natural and anthropogenic-driven climate change, including especially a marine heatwave that occurred between 2013-2016 (Catton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Bell<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018, Starko&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). A secondary stressor includes overgrazing of the kelp by abnormally large Purple Sea Urchin (<em>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</em>) populations, which was predicated by the loss of their sea star predator via disease (Catton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Starko <em>et al. </em>2019). A harmful algal bloom that occurred off Sonoma in 2011 was an additional stressor leading to declines in Northern California (Catton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).

An experimental removal study of Giant Kelp&#160;(<em>Macrocystis pyrifera</em>) conducted at three sites off&#160;Santa Catalina Island, California recorded a significant decline in both recruitment and density of Kelp Perch (<em>Brachyistius frenatus</em>). In live-bearing species such as this, losses in the adult population reduces its ability to quickly recover even when kelp has recovered (O’Connor and Anderson 2010). Studies are currently underway to elaborate its current population status, including a full-genome analysis of genetic diversity across its range (J. Toy pers. comm. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>Kelp has declined in a large part of this species' range. Off Vancouver, Canada, kelp cover and diversity has declined over time (as compared to abundance in 1993-1995), with the most significant decline occurring&#160;between 2009 and 2017. Kelp abundance in the Southern California Bight is stable or has slightly increased (Krumhansl&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), but severe declines have been documented in Northern California in recent years (Catton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Kelp abundance in California naturally fluctuates on a decadal-scale per the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation as well as periodic El Niño events, but is also probably&#160;impacted by anthropogenic-driven climate change at some level. Giant Kelp canopy biomass from San Francisco to San Diego increased on average over the past 34 years, but recent large-scale warming events such as the 2014 North Pacific warming event and the 2015–2016 El Niño have caused the biomass trends to decline (Bell<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).

It is heavily targeted by fishers throughout its range, and has experienced historical population declines as a result. A variety of intrinsic characteristics (e.g., late-maturing, long-lived, aggregate spawning behaviour, predictable occurrence and lack of fear of human presence) make it particularly susceptible to overfishing. It may also be a protogynous hermaphrodite, but that is awaiting confirmation.<br/><br/>In the southeastern U.S., this species experienced a two generation length time period of severe decline from the 1950s to the early 1990s, during which the population declined to near-zero or by at least 84%. A stock assessment model published in 2016 indicated there has been an absolute population reduction of about 33% from 1950 to 2014. A fishing moratorium has been in place in U.S. waters for the past 27 years or since 1990, and the population has been mostly increasing as a result, but is not yet fully recovered. In Brazil, declines in population, including aggregation size, have occurred, but the time period is unknown and the percent is not quantified. A fishing ban has been in place in Brazilian waters since 2002, however, due to lack of enforcement in most areas, poaching continues and fishing mortality reduction is still limited; therefore, the status of its population in Brazil is unknown, but likely remains at a reduced level. Unquantified, but serious declines have also occurred in Cuba, Mexico and Belize. Overfishing and large-scale declines are also likely occurring elsewhere in its range.<br/><br/>In addition to fishing, the pervasive removal and/or degradation of mangroves across its range is a major threat to juvenile survival. Other threats also include reduced genetic diversity, health stresses caused by high mercury concentrations and localised recruitment failures caused by extreme red tide and cold water events given the nearshore and shallow depths often occupied by this species.<br/><br/>Outside of U.S. waters, conservation measures are not sufficient to allow recovery or to prevent continued declines. Even though official historical quantitative records are poor to non-existent, it is clear from multiple well-documented anecdotal observations that a rapid decline occurred over at least the past 50 years as fishing intensity increased and as mangroves declined over the 1970s to 1990s. Therefore, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% or more since the early 1950s, which covers a time period of about three generation lengths (at least 64.5 years), and is listed as Vulnerable A2bcd.<br/><br/>Improvements in fisheries monitoring and management are needed outside U.S waters, and the closure of the U.S. fishery should remain in place, especially since we suspect that at least an 80% population reduction could occur within the next three generations should the current management be removed. Spawning aggregation sites and mangrove preservation/restoration should be priorities for conservation. The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","Adults are most often associated with offshore rocky reefs, wrecks, artificial reefs and oil platforms. It can occur in coral reef habitat, but is much more abundant on rocky reef (Collins 2009; Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011; Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2014a,c; Collins <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mangroves are the primary juvenile habitat (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007); juveniles are also occasionally observed on adjacent inshore structured habitats, such as seagrass, tide pools, shallow rocky areas, jetties and docks (Bullock <em>et al</em>. 1992; Sadovy and Eklund 1999; Gerber <em>et al</em>. 2005; Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a,b; Lobato <em>et al</em>. 2016), but return to 'home' sites in nearby mangroves at low tide (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Juvenile distribution in mangroves depends on local water quality, particularly dissolved oxygen content (&gt;4 ppm) and mid-range salinities (&gt;10 ppt; Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007). Within the mangrove system, undercuts and sites with high structural complexity are particularly favoured by juveniles (Frias-Torres 2006). Individuals spend their first 5-6 years in this habitat and reach a meter in length and about 50 lbs in weight as juveniles and are extremely site-specific (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Juveniles move from nearshore shallow habitats at a total length of about one meter to take up residence on offshore reefs (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007, Collins <em>et al.</em> 2015). In French Guiana, the population of this species is comprised primarily of juveniles that utilize rocky habitats on the windward sides of offshore islands due to the ephemeral nature of the Amazonian-influenced mangroves (Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a,b). Large juveniles and adults on offshore structure display strong site fidelity but move from home sites to spawning aggregation sites during July (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2013, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2015) and remain on spawning sites until mid-October. This species primarily consumes fish, crabs and crustaceans (Sadovy and Eklund 1999, Koenig and Coleman 2009, Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a, Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2015, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Maximum total length is 250 cm (Heemstra and Randall 1993).<br/><br/>In the southeastern U.S., spawning aggregations occur at the same localities in relatively shallow (10-50 m) water from August through mid-October (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2002, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2013, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2016, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Adults have been observed to migrate up to 500 km to spawning sites (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2013). It often spawns near wrecks (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2015), but also uses natural sites which it often excavates (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011). Aggregations are relatively small, usually with fewer than 150 individuals, and there is no evidence that spawning occurs outside of aggregations (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Aggregations have been detected during the austral summer (December to March), with peaks in January and February in shallow waters (&lt;30 m depth) in at least seven Brazilian states (Bueno <em>et al</em>. 2016, Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2016). Many spawning aggregation sites have been identified in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf (Mann <em>et al</em>. 2009, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2016), and one has recently been documented in southern Brazil as well (Bueno <em>et al</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>This species may have a reproductive strategy of diandric protogyny (Koenig and Coleman 2016), but functional hermaphroditism has not yet been confirmed. The total length at first maturation for females was estimated at 105.6 cm and 100% of individuals are mature at 126 cm and age at first maturity is about six (Sadovy and Eklund 1999) or seven years (Bullock <em>et al</em>. 1992, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Growth rates for male and female are similar, averaging &gt;10 cm per year through age six, then slowing to about three cm per year by age 15, and finally declining to less than one cm per year after age 25 (Bullock <em>et al</em>. 1992). From individuals sampled between 1977-1990 in the Gulf of Mexico, Bullock <em>et al</em>. (1992) recorded that 46% were ≤12 years old, ~78% were ≤ 18 years old, and ~22% of the fish were relatively old (&gt;18 years, up to a maximum age of 37 years). However, it is very likely that this species reaches older ages than 37 years since the specimens from Bullock <em>et al</em>. (1992) were collected after this species was already historically overfished and other comparable grouper species are known to reach ages older than this (e.g., <em>Hyporthodus flavolimbatus</em> to 85 years and <em>Mycteroperca interstitialis</em> to 41 years; SEDAR47 2016). Individuals sampled from 2011 to 2015 on the east coast of Florida, were still ≤12 years old (85%), with 99% of the fish ≤18 years of age. In Brazil, the maximum observed age was 33 years, but most of analysed specimens did not reach 25 years (B.P. Ferreira pers. comm. 2016). In French Guiana, individuals ranged from 1 to 17 years of age, which indicated that the population is probably composed mostly of juveniles (Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015b). Natural mortality is 0.18 (SEDAR47 2016), which is supported by estimates of natural mortality through recapture rates (Koenig and Coleman 2016). Further studies on age, growth and reproduction are currently in preparation for publication (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Based on a longevity of 37 years, age of first maturity of 6 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 21.5 years.","<p>Overfishing is a major threat to this species, and its susceptibility to rapid population decline is increased due to heavy exploitation of spawning aggregations (Bullock <em>et al</em>. 1992, Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Mangrove coverage, which is responsible for biomass production of this species, has been reduced by at least a third since the 1970s to 1990s, and much more of the habitat is unsuitable as juvenile habitat because of anthropogenic impacts (Sadovy and Eklund 1999, Valiela <em>et al</em>. 2001, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007, C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Multiple cohorts were affected by a cold temperature event in 2010, which caused a die-off of juveniles in the Everglades National Park, Florida (Hallac <em>et al</em>. 2010). Juveniles have also been impacted by past severe red tide events on the West Florida Shelf (SEDAR47 2016). A study conducted in Florida reported that mean mercury concentrations in individuals of this species were within the range known to cause direct health effects in fish after long-term exposure, and concluded this could cause stress on their populations (Adams and Sonne 2013, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Another study conducted off Belize also found elevated levels of mercury (Evers <em>et al</em>. 2009). Ongoing research on the impacts from high mercury concentrations indicate that older males in particular suffer liver damage and/or mortality, and that egg viability is reduced (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Another potential threat to the recovering population is inbreeding, and related genetics studies are currently in preparation for publication (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).<br/></p>","This species has undergone a severe population decline throughout its entire range and is now rare where it was formerly abundant due to overfishing (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In most areas, there has been no indication of population recovery. Unfortunately, there are very few historical data sets that are available to gauge population sizes prior to widespread exploitation (beginning around the 1950s) to serve as a reference for the degree of decline in population sizes. As of the writing of this assessment, the southeastern U.S. is the only area in which an appreciable increase in the population of this species has occurred, this following a moratorium on catch in 1990 (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). This is also the only area where reasonably accurate historical landings and effort data are available, and the only area in which a quantitative stock assessment analysis has been completed (SEDAR 47 2016). Even though official historical quantitative records are poor to non-existent, it is clear from well-documented anecdotal observations that a rapid decline occurred over at least the past 50 years as fishing intensity increased and as mangroves declined over the 1970s to 1990s. Therefore, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% or more since the early 1950s, which covers a time period of about three generation lengths (at least 64.5 years).<br/><br/>There is empirical evidence that the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic populations should be treated as one unit. Craig <em>et al</em>. (2009) found that genetic differentiation occurs between Belize and southwest Florida, and Brazil and Florida. Population genetics studies are currently underway in Florida, and preliminary results indicate that inbreeding is likely due to the moderately low genetically effective population size, which is further evidence for a population crash (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>United States:&#160; </strong>Based on historical catches by state, the highest abundance of this species in U.S. waters is in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and its historical centre of abundance has been in the Ten Thousand Islands of southwest Florida (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). This species has been targeted by fishers in U.S. waters since colonial times (late 1800s) and fishing mortality was excessively exceeded from 1963-1989, which resulted in severe population declines. In the 1950s and 1960s, this species was common off southern Florida, but by the 1970s and 1980s, the population had been severely depleted to the point that fishers were forced to travel offshore and target spawning aggregations to sustain catch (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Overall, the steepest period of decline in this species is estimated to have begun in the 1950s and extended at least through the early 1990s, which is a 41-year period (1.9 generations), and during this time, the population declined by nearly 84%. This rapid decline in numbers reflects not only a trend in greater harvest, but also intrinsic biological characteristics which make this species particularly vulnerable to over harvest. These characteristics are primarily reflected in their aggregate spawning behaviour (in which several hundred individuals gather in a predicable place and time), which can lead to hyperstability of populations (SEDAR47 2016). Adults were generally uncommon to rare in the mid 1990s, but the population has been recovering upon the implementation of a fishing moratorium in 1990 and continues to the present. The juvenile abundance index in southwest Florida substantially declined during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but has been steadily increasing since the 1990 moratorium until at least 2006 (Cass-Calay and Schmidt 2009). Abundance increased in the mid-1990s directly offshore of the high-quality mangrove nursery of the Ten Thousand Islands and then continued to expand north and south, eventually increasing off Florida’s central east coast as well until at least 2007 (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011, SEDAR47 2016). Abundance declined after 2007 until 2011, and despite some upward trends, abundance remains low overall. A severe red tide event on the West Florida shelf in 2005 and cold-kills in 2008 and 2010 in South Florida estuaries are thought to be the drivers of these declines (SEDAR47 2016). Porch <em>et al</em>. (2003) estimated there was a 90-100% chance for a 50% population recovery by 2006-2011. Fisher compliance to the moratorium, however, was found to be lower than 90%, which led to a prediction of less than a 40% chance that the population would recover to the 50% population recovery benchmark by 2020 (Porch <em>et al</em>. 2006). Under the moratorium, the estimated relative biomass increased from 0.22 to 0.72 from 1993-2003 and it was categorized as overfished in south Florida in SEDAR6 (2004), but the authors could not determine if overfishing was still occurring due to the lack of data. Considering its high vulnerability to overfishing, a continuation of the moratorium was recommended until further research could determine a complete rebuilding to the target biomass (SEDAR6 2004). From 1993 to 2010 (17 years), relative abundance increased by about five fold, but its overfished status in the South Atlantic could not be determined due to the lack of natural mortality parameters and reliable estimates of moratorium effectiveness (SEDAR 2011). The most recent spawning stock biomass models suggest it is no longer overfished nor experiencing overfishing (SEDAR47 2016); however, the population continues to be skewed towards younger fish 26 years after closure, and will require more time to rebuild the older age classes (Koenig and Coleman 2016).<br/><br/>Stock assessments conducted by the SouthEast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) have been repeatedly rejected under peer review because of poor historical records and the resulting inability to determine population recovery in terms of size and geographical extent. Despite the large degree of uncertainty in the historical data upon which the most recent stock assessment, SEDAR47 (2016), is based, it is the only available stock assessment with which historical trends in abundance may be gauged. And, while we acknowledge the large degree of uncertainty in this analysis, we posit that the overall trends in the magnitudes of changes are likely to be real even though the absolute values may change with improved historical input data. It is also important to note that the values presented below are based on computer simulations (models) and do not represent direct counts of individuals. We caution that the absolute numbers cited below be interpreted with caution. It should also be noted that this analysis is only for the population of this species in the southeastern U.S. SEDAR 47 (2016) utilized a stock assessment model to hind cast various metrics of abundance to the year 1950. That analysis showed that the average number of individuals among model iterations in 1950 was 513,072 in the southeast U.S.&#160; This number remained relatively constant until about 1975, when it declined from a mean of 378,164 individuals in 1975 to a mean of 82,900 individuals in 1991, which represents about an 80% decline over 16 years. After 1991, the number of individuals increased to a high of 1,186,100 in 2006, but declined thereafter until 2011 with a mean number of fish of 298,500, which is a 75% decline over five years.&#160; In 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis), there was a mean of 345,700 individuals. From 1950 to the historical low (1991), there was an absolute population reduction of about 84% (over 41 years). From the historical low in 1991 to 2014 there has been a population increase of about 86%. Over the entire period modelled from 1950 to 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis) there has been an absolute population reduction of about 33%. The increases in the numbers of individuals were largely driven by an increase in age-0 fish (which cannot reproduce). During the period 1950-2014, age-0 Atlantic goliath grouper represented 50-85% of the entire population. In 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis), the percentage of age-0 fish was 69%.&#160; <br/><br/><strong>Cuba, Mexico and Belize:&#160; </strong>No fishery assessments have been conducted for this species in the southern Gulf of Mexico and Mexican fishery statistics do not include fishing effort (CONAPESCA). In Mexico, exploitation is unregulated and its population status is poorly known. Some fishery dependent data indicate declining catch trends of this species (Salas <em>et al</em>. 2006). Fisher interviews and records from fishing cooperatives off the northern Yucatan indicate that catch has severely declined over about the past 35 years (Aguilar-Perera <em>et al</em>. 2009; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). In Cuba, lobster fishermen frequently captured this grouper species (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). Although national statistics are not available, population declines observed in Cuba are at least similar to those observed in Mexico. In Belize, it is considered overfished and undergoing overfishing (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>Due to a fishing moratorium for this species in place in Brazil since 2002, catch declined by 70% after 2002, but an average of 393 tons per year were poached between 2003-2011 (Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2014b). For example, in the state of Maranhão, fishermen have illegally caught large numbers of adults in spawning aggregations (M.O. Freitas pers. comm. 2016). In northern Brazil and on the Amazonian coast, catches are reported to continue and poachers have targeted aggregations and the species is openly captured and traded in local markets (B. Bentes pers. comm. 2016). In Santa Catarina, Brazil, at least two aggregation sites were mapped and aggregation size ranged from two to 60 individuals (Gerhardinger <em>et al</em>. 2009), but subsequent dives showed that these aggregations were depleted or had moved (Bueno <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species is relatively rare in offshore oceanic islands (Bertoncini <em>et al</em>. 2014). Fishers on the Abrolhos Bank noted that the abundance of this species has declined by more than 40% and that poaching continues to occur (Zapelini <em>et al</em>. 2017). Spawning populations in northern Brazil are the main source for the population of juveniles in French Guiana (Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a and b). During Reef Check underwater surveys conducted in Brazil from 2002-2017 in 12 localities and 114 reef sites, individuals of this species were observed only three times, all inside fully protected areas (Reef Check Brazil unpub. data); however, this species can occur recurrently in some very predictable places, particularly shipwrecks. Poaching occurs at these sites despite the protected status of this species in Brazil (B. Padovani-Ferreira and Athila Bertoncini pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>West Africa: </strong>This species is common in shallow waters along mangrove swamps and river mouths near the rivers of Zaire, Ogoué, Cameroon and tributaries as well as near offshore oil platforms of Cabinda and Gabon (Port Gentil), where it is captured by local artisanal fisheries. It is apparently rare in the Gulf of Guinea islands; one specimen was speared in Sao Tomé in 2009 and two juveniles were observed in 2015 (J. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016). Two specimens were taken via spear in Benguela, southern Angola in 2011 (J. de Sousa pers. comm. 2016). One <em>ca</em> 250 kg specimen was observed in a fish market in Libreville, Gabon in 2015 (J. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016).<span lang=""EN-US"">",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in the Atlantic Ocean in the west from northeastern Florida, south along the U.S., throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and along South America to Santa Catarina, Brazil (Hostim-Silva et al. 2005) and in the east along West Africa from Senegal to Cabinda, Angola (Friedlander <em>et al</em>. 2014, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/></p>","<p>This species is targeted by commercial and recreational fishers throughout its range. This species is also particularly valuable to dive ecotourism (Shideler and Pierce 2016, A.A. Bertoncini pers. comm. 2016).<br/></p>",Marine,"There has been a complete moratorium on harvest of these species in continental U.S. waters since 1990 and in U.S. Caribbean waters since 1993, and it is clear that the implementation of this management measure was the key factor in the increase in individuals in the southeastern U.S. seen at the current time (Porch <em>et al</em>. 2003, SEDAR47 2016). The SEDAR47 stock assessment analysis shows that the population can decline by nearly 85% in just 1.9 generations in the absence of this management effort, and therefore, it is highly recommended that this moratorium remain in place (Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2012, Frias-Torres 2012, Koenig and Coleman 2016).<br/><br/>Conservation measures for this species off Mexico are insufficient and improvement in regional and international management, including a formal stock assessment, are needed (Aguilar-Perera <em>et al</em>. 2009). Under direction of the IBAMA (Brazilian Environmental Agency), this species has been fully protected in Brazil since 2002. This reduced fishing effort, but did not eliminate it due to insufficient enforcement against poaching (Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2014b, B. Padovani-Ferreira and Athila Bertoncini pers. comm. 2018). The inter-Ministry ordinance No.13 of 2015 granted protection for this species until 2023 in Brazilian waters. Spawning aggregation sites should be a priority for conservation. This species has been recorded in several marine protected areas, including the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Hickerson <em>et al</em>. 2008) and Parque Nacional Guanahacabibes in western Cuba (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). Research is currently underway on adult and juvenile habitat preference, size, age, movement, aggregation location and behaviour and feeding ecology in U.S. waters. Further research is needed on the genetics and age structure of the offshore portion of the U.S. population to improve stock assessment models (SEDAR47 2016).","",,false,false,Global

It is reported that the total population on Mauritius contains around 450 mature individuals. The Echo Parakeet is therefore listed as Vulnerable under Criterion D1.<p></p>","This species now survives in forest and upland scrub (Marshall 1997)<strong></strong>, with lowland, intermediate and scrub forests being very important feeding areas (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. It appears to be a strictly arboreal forager, feeding mainly on native plants and taking a wide range of parts including buds, young shoots, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, twigs and even bark and sap (Jones 1987, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. They return to favoured food trees, some of which have been used for generations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Birds forage singly or in small groups in different areas at different seasons and are known to travel several kilometers to and from feeding areas in search of food, although the dwarf forest and scrublands of the south-west plateau are an important foraging area throughout the year (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. Nesting takes place in natural cavities in native trees (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. It is monogamous, but breeding units in the 1970s and 1980s often comprised a group of one female with up to three males, one of which was dominant and mated with and fed the female (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The presence of extra males was probably the result of a formerly skewed sex ratio; pairs are usually hostile to extra males, who seem to have no positive effect on fledging success, which is probably related to the experience of the dominant male (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is 1-4 (but normally 2-3) eggs, which are laid from September-December (Thorsen and Jones 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><strong></strong> Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>, and incubation, by the female, lasts 21-25 days (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The population currently experiences high rates of egg fertility (84%), high hatchability of fertile eggs (82%) and fledging success of hatched young (76%) (Jones<em> et al</em>. 2013). One to two chicks are usually fledged, though up to four have been recorded (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998, 2013)<strong></strong> from the end of October to the beginning of February or later, and fledgling parakeets are reputed to stay with their parents, being fed by them for at least 2-3 months after leaving the nest (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","This species's earlier decline and contracting distribution corresponds to the severe destruction and degradation of its native habitat (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The population crashed from a likely total of several thousand following forest destruction and the replacement of its favoured feeding habitat, upland dwarf forest, with plantations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. In 1996, only 5% of the island was covered with native vegetation (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The areas of upland native forest that remain continue to be highly degraded by cyclones, the influences of past forestry practices, the spread of introduced plants such as guava <em>Psidium cattleianum</em>, privet <em>Ligustrum robustum</em> and jamrosa <em>Syzygium jambos</em> and the effect of introduced feral mammals such as pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em> and rusa deer <em>Rusa timorensis</em> (Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span> Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The production of native fruit, on which the parakeet feeds, and regeneration of potential nest trees is thus poor (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. Recent research suggests that food shortage due to deterioration of the native forest is the major cause of nest failure; although exotics can provide an abundant food source it is not available year-round or even throughout the breeding season (Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong>. Crab-eating macaques <em>Macaca fascicularis</em> and black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> are amongst a number of introduced arboreal species which pose a threat to parakeets by raiding nests and competing for native fruits (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>.

Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. The decline in the number of old native trees, which are lost to storm damage and senescence, has intensified competition for nesting cavities, with 14-19% of <em>P. eques</em> cavities lost to competitors each year (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Infestations of nest fly larvae can be severe in some years and, without intervention, would kill many young (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the virus that causes Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>","At the end of the 2016/2017 breeding season, the population was estimated at c.756 birds. The number of mature individuals in the 2018/2019 breeding season was estimated as approximately 450 individuals (S. Henshaw and V.

Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The species’s decline and contracting distribution was likely caused by the severe and large-scale destruction and degradation of its forest habitat for conversion into plantations (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996, Jones<em> et al.</em> 1998).&#160;<br/><br/>Since then, intense conservation efforts have aided the continuous recovery of the species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013). By now, the largest part of the population is confined to restricted areas of the Black River Gorges National Park (6,800 ha) in southwestern Mauritius. Reintroductions of captive-bred birds there ceased in 2005/2006 (C. Jones <em>in litt</em>. 2019), following the outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD). Currently, two additional populations are being established in other parts of Mauritius: between 2015 and 2017, wild-born individuals were translocated to the Bambous Mountains on the East Coast of the island, where breeding could be confirmed in 2018, and this population is deemed self-sustaining (V. Tatayah, S. Henshaw and C. Jones <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Another translocation programme started in early 2018 to establish a population in Chamarel in the south-west; however this population has not been breeding yet (V. Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Translocations to both Bambous and Chamarel are planned to continue in the next few years to reinforce the population (V. Tatayah <em>in litt</em>. 2019).<strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&#160;</strong><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The species has been the subject of a conservation programme since 1973 (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The dramatic increase in the species's population in recent years is undoubtedly due to an intensive programme to manage the wild population combined with a highly successful captive breeding programme since the 1993/1994 breeding season (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong> - a collaborative effort of  the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, the World Parrot Trust, the Mauritian Government and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust Society (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Between 1997 and 2004, when reintroductions were completed, a total of 139 captive reared birds were released (Jones 2010). Clutch and brood manipulations of wild nests were carried out between 1994 and 2005 to increase productivity and obtain individuals for captive breeding (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2013). The intensity of conservation management was reduced in 2005 to reduce the risk of the spread of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013). Current conservation management measures are more hands-off and directed towards maximising wild survival and recruitment (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Nest cavity improvement is carried out to address a shortage in the availability of quality natural breeding sites. This involves modifications to protect against weather, competitors, and predators (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Nest parasites (nest flies and mites) are controlled via the addition of pesticide-treated substrate. Artificial nest boxes were first used for breeding in 2000, with uptake steadily increasing since. The majority of breeding pairs nested in artificial nest boxes in the 2010/2011 breeding season, and productivity was higher at these sites compared with natural cavities (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Supplementary feeding in the form of commercially produced parrot pellets was provided consistently since 1997, and as of the 2010/2011 season was consumed by over 50% of the population. Consumption of supplementary food is associated with the production of larger clutches, more eggs hatched per clutch, and more individuals fledged per brood (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Habitat management has been directed at increasing the productivity of native forest and has included the foundation in 1993 of the Black River National Park in 6,574 ha of native forest (Jones and Hartley 1995, Greenwood 1996), including most of the species's remaining habitat (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. There are 14 Conservation Management Areas (CMAs), ranging from 0.2 to 24 ha, in which native forest is manually cleared of weeds (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Some of these CMAs are heavily utilised by the species as their trees produce bumper crops (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;Research has occurred on present and historic genetic variation of the species so that the effects of the population bottleneck can be quantified and current populations managed to preserve maximum genetic diversity (Tollington <em>et al. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. Research into the impact of PBFD is likely to be ongoing for several years (Malham 2007), and has involved intensive screening of birds since 2005 (Richards 2010, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the causative virus in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu <em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington <em>et al</em>. 2015). Strict biosecurity protocols are deployed by conservation managers to restrict transmission of disease. An experiment testing the effectiveness of these protocols&#160; has suggested that while they reduced the probability of nestling infection, they were in fact associated with a slight reduction in fledging success (Fogell <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;Recently, wild-born individuals were translocated to the Bambous Mountains on the east coast of Mauritius to establish a new population. Breeding was confirmed there in the 2018/2019 season (S. Henshaw <em>in litt. </em>2019).&#160;Another translocation programme was started in early 2018 to establish a population in Chamarel in the south-west; no breeding has yet been recorded there (V. Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt.</em> 2019).<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Translocations to both Bambous and Chamarel are planned to continue in the next few years to reinforce the population (V. Tatayah <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Establishment of a population on Réunion, where the species formerly occurred and suitable habitat exists, has been suggested&#160;(Jones <em>et al. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. Current management practices such as of the provision of artificial nest boxes and supplementary food are likely to be long-term requirements of the population while remaining native forest is rehabilitated (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013, Jones <em>in litt </em>2019).

Its principle food is carrion, with its diet including a large proportion of bones (as much as 85%) whereupon the bird gets nutrition from the marrow inside. The rest of its diet comprises tortoises, and occasionally also live mammals and birds. It is generally unwilling to compete with vultures at carcasses, and will wait patiently to feed, scavenging older carcasses if fresh meat is scarce. Bones are either consumed whole, broken using the bill, hammered against the ground, or lifted into the air and dropped from 50-80 m high onto hard rock. Tortoises and hyraxes are generally treated in the same way as bones.&#160; It is known to scavenge in rubbish dumps, including urban areas in Ethiopia (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<strong> Breeding&#160;</strong>The species will construct large nests (averaging 1-m diameter), composed of branches and lined with animal remains such as skin and wool, as well as dung and occasionally also rubbish. Nests are located on remote overhung cliff ledges or in caves and will be re-used over the years.

Disturbance has also increased due to improved accessibility to mountain sites (Izquierdo 2018). Rapid increases in grazing pressure and human populations in the mountains of Turkey are causing habitat degradation there (S. Viter <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Suitable habitat is also threatened by pipeline construction through the Caucasus mountains (S. Viter <em>in litt</em>. 2014). In parts of the range where transhumance occurs, there may be asymmetries in food availability at different times of year (Margalida&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).

EU Birds Directive Annex I. CMS Appendix II. Raptors MOU Category 1. A Multi-species Action Plan for African-Eurasian Vultures has been produced (Botha&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;In Europe, captive breeding and reintroduction programmes have been  carried out in the Austrian, French, Italian and Swiss Alps with  individuals subsequently spreading into other parts of France (Snow and  Perrins 1998, Frey and Walter 1989). Reintroduction programmes are underway in parts of Spain (J. A. Gil Gallus <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Feeding stations have been provided  in the Pyrenees with resulting increases in numbers of the species, and  the provision of similar stations across the species’s range could  improve its global population density (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). However, while these have helped to increase population growth and individual survival, they can have negative impacts on vultures; for instance they can lead to habitat saturation, with individuals' territories overlapping at these areas, and can lead to reduced productivity (Carrete <em>et al. </em>2009, Gil <em>et al. </em>2014). For example, the reintroduced population in the Central Alps increased exponentially between 1998 and 2015, but due to a high level of philopatry there has been little dispersal away from the initial release site, resulting in a high density of breeding pairs in the core area (Jenny <em>et al. </em>2018). Habitat saturation may also lead to polygyny (Gil <em>et al. </em>2017). Supplementary feeding in poor-quality territories and extraction of the extra young produced has successfully been used as a cheaper alternative to captive breeding for reintroduction programmes (Ferrer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017), however there are concerns that this may negatively impact the population from which the young are extracted (Margalida&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). A reintroduction programme was attempted in Kenya in 1999-2003 (S. Thomsett <em>in litt</em>. 2011). The species is monitored in Southern Africa, with an annual count day which not only aids in the monitoring of the species, but also raises awareness (Krüger 2015). A Single Species Action Plan for the conservation of the Western Palearctic population of Bearded Vulture was published in 2018 (Izquierdo <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct coordinated surveys to monitor the species's global population trend. Assess the threat posed by diclofenac and other drugs used in livestock, as well as the impacts of climate change and feral dogs. Reduce disturbance in and around nesting areas. Mitigate against the impacts of wind turbines and powerlines. Combat the threat of persecution through laws and awareness-raising activities. Provide feeding stations throughout the species's range. Try to address the illegal trade and use of vultures in medicine (Krüger 2015). Assess methods of negating the negative impacts that result from feeding stations (see Carrete <em>et al. </em>2009, Moreno-Opo <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;<br/>The Single Species Action Plan for the conservation of the Western Palearctic population of Bearded Vulture, <em>Gypaetus barbatus barbatus</em>, (2018) was prepared in the framework of the EuroSAP (LIFE14 PRE/UK/000002) LIFE project, produced by Vulture Conservation Foundation and co-ordinated by BirdLife International. It provides a comprehensive programme of research and conservation measures needed to conserve this species in its European range. As well as the actions mentioned above, it highlights the threat of lead poisoning, the need for collaboration with farmers to mitigate livestock-wildlife conflicts and the need to do more to conserve genetic diversity, including through creating a captive genetic reservoir.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Consequently it qualifies as Near Threatened. <p></p>","The species inhabits forested areas in hills and mountains at 300-1,400 m in Spain, but higher in Asia, where it also occupies scrub and arid and semi-arid alpine steppe and grasslands up to 4,500 m<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Thiollay 1994). It forages over many kinds of open terrain, including forest, bare mountains, steppe and open grasslands.  Nests are built in trees or on rocks (the latter extremely rarely in Europe but more frequently in parts of Asia), often aggregated in very loose colonies or nuclei.  Its diet consists mainly of carrion from medium-sized or large mammal carcasses, although snakes and insects have been recorded as food items. Live prey is rarely taken. In Mongolia, at least, the species is reliant on livestock numbers for successful nesting (Batbayar <em>et al</em>. 2006).  <p></p>","The two main threats to the species are direct mortality caused by humans (either accidentally or deliberately) and decreasing availability of food. The main cause of unnatural death is the use of poisoned baits for predator extermination<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b), although shooting and destruction of nests also occurs<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b; N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005), and they may accidentally get caught in traps set for other predators (Zhatkanbaev 2011)<strong></strong>. Shooting and poisoning are increasing in Mongolia<em></em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, and many birds are trapped or shot in China for their feathers. There are fears that veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several <em>Gyps</em> vultures in India, may have a negative impact on <em>A. monachus</em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005; Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016)<strong></strong>, particularly as increasing numbers of the species are wintering in northern India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(T. Katzner <em>in litt. </em>2005). The recent approval for commercialisation of veterinary diclofenac in Spain may have devastating effects on European vultures - in 2020 a Cinereous Vulture was confirmed as the first individual to die from veterinary diclofenac in Europe (BirdLife 2021). A study in central Spain during 2003-2005 found high concentrations of antibiotics in blood samples from 57% of nestlings tested<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Lemus <em>et al</em>. 2008). The same study found two antibiotics in the liver samples of all dead nestlings that were tested. It is hypothesised that antibiotic residues, particularly quinolones, cause liver and kidney damage, deplete lymphoid organs and alter bacteria flora, facilitating pathogenic bacterial and fungal infections<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Lemus <em>et al</em>. 2008). The anti-inflammatory drug nimesulide, suspected to be highly toxic is also considered to be present widely across Nepal (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2018). In Europe, decreased food availability was formerly caused by European Union legislation on carcass disposal<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b), however, recently passed regulations will allow the operation of feeding stations for scavengers<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(A. Brunner <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In eastern Europe and central Asia, particularly in the former Soviet Union, changes in agricultural practices and human migration from the countryside to the cities have greatly reduced numbers of domestic livestock. In Georgia and Armenia, declines may be linked to the loss of subsidies for sheep-herding in the post-Soviet era (M. McGrady <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Additionally, there have been steep declines in many populations of wild ungulates which provide a major food source for the species. The Saiga antelope (<em>Saiga tartarica</em>), for example, numbered over one million individuals ten years ago, and has now been reduced to a population of 30,000-40,000 owing to uncontrolled hunting and severe winters (W. Fremuth <em>in litt.</em> 2005). In South Korea, food limitation is a serious problem such that the species relies on supplementary food (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong style=""""></strong>. Habitat loss is also thought to be important<strong style=""""><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004). For instance, in Portugal, there may be suitable foraging areas, but nesting sites are limited (Lourenço <em>et al. </em>2013). The majority of brood losses occur during the incubation period and it is suspected this may be partially due to low and fluctuating temperatures (Batbayar <em style="""">et al</em>. 2006) and so changes in air temperatures resulting from climate change may be a potential future threat to the species. Nest abandonment can also occur as a result of disturbance, for instance cork exploitation (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2011). Recent studies surrounding the core population of Cinereous Vultures in the Balkans (thought to be genetically distinctive and geographically isolated) also found wind farms to be a potential threat towards the species (Vasilakis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Where operational wind farms existed, collision mortality was thought to affect c. 5-11% of the core population (Vasilakis&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Low mitochondrial diversity and demographic bottlenecks were also found in Turkish populations, likely preventing population expansion (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a, b). The exact effect genetic vulnerability however requires further investigation. Due to proximity to urban areas, electric shocks and collision can further impact migratory birds, especially across the species's migration route to China (Ming 2019).<br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated to number 8,400-11,400 pairs, equating to 16,800-22,800 mature individuals, or c.&#160;25,200-34,200 individuals. This consists of 2,900-3,400 pairs in Europe (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>) and 5,500-8,000 pairs in Asia (Anon. 2004).

It was considered to occasionally breed in Portugal, North Macedonia and Albania, but no longer breed in Slovenia, Italy, Cyprus, Moldova and Romania. However, the species was seen in Romania, Italian eastern Alps, and in northern France recently, as well as being recorded in a rehabilitation center in Jordan (Bowden and Botha 2017).&#160;Recolonisation was also confirmed in Portugal following reintroduction programmes (Bowden and Botha 2017). Further monitoring is thus required to confirm its presence across south-western Europe.

In Europe, populations are increasing in Spain (minimum 1,500 pairs [Barov and Derhé 2011]), Portugal and France&#160;(Barov and Derhé 2011) as well as Greece (BirdLife International 2015). Populations are&#160;stable in Macedonia<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Barov and Derhé 2011). Numbers are decreasing or fluctuating in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey and the Ukraine<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2004; Barov and Derhé 2011; BirdLife International 2015), though new nesting areas have been recently found in Turkey (Kirazli and&#160;Yamaç 2013)<strong></strong>. A recent study moreover suggests that the Turkish population (the largest in the Western Palearctic) is likely to number c. 112 individuals, existing as a single subpopulation (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a). Overall, the European population underwent a large increase between 1990 and 2000, possibly &gt;30% overall<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2004;  I. Burfield <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong> and increased from 1,330-1,874 in 1993-1996 to 1,995-2,852 in 2000-2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). The current European population trend is increasing (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).<br/><br/>Much less information is available regarding the status and population trends of the species in Asia, where the bulk of the global population resides.  There are probably over 1,000 pairs in the Asian part of Russia and a further 1,760 pairs in China<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Ye Xiao-Ti 1991). It appears that breeding populations are more or less stable in Mongolia<strong></strong> (where the species is described as common [<em></em>N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005]) and Pakistan (A. Khan, A. Parveen and R. Yasmeen <em>in litt.</em> 2005) (where it is described as scarce), although fluctuations in distribution and breeding success occur, and populations within some nature reserves in Mongolia (where there are few domestic livestock) are declining<em></em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005).  In Kazakhstan, however, populations of all vulture species are in severe decline, owing to a precipitous decline in their main food resource, the Saiga antelope (<em>Saiga tartarica</em>) (W. Fremuth <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. This trend may be mirrored in a number of other central Asian countries where populations of both domesticated livestock and wild ungulates have declined greatly in recent years<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(T. Katzner <em>in litt. </em>2005). Very little is known about population trends on its wintering grounds, although, in Nepal, wintering populations are declining in the east and possibly increasing in the west (but this may be due to better coverage) (Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016).<strong></strong>&#160;It may be increasing in India (T.

The Flyway Action Plan for the Conservation of the Cinereous Vulture (CVFAP) was additionally finalised in 2017 (Andevski <em>et al</em>. 2017). The EU Birds Directive has contributed to the recovery and conservation of the species in Europe, particularly Spain (see Moreno-Opo and Margalida 2014), where the population has increased from an estimated 290 pairs in 1984 to 2,068 pairs in 2011<strong style=""""></strong><span style=""font-weight: bold; ""> </span>(BirdLife International 2015). Co-operation between Spanish government agencies and conservationists under the 'Antidote Programme' also appears to have been effective in mitigating the effects of poisoned baits. Both the Spanish and the Andalusian Governments have produced anti-poisoning strategies, but the former still remain to be financially supported while the latter need more decisive official endorsement. A reintroduction project in Grands Causses, southern France has resulted in the establishment of a small breeding population (16 pairs were breeding in 2006 [Eliotout <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2007]) with good prospects. Following further transfer of eight Cinereous Vultures from Spain to France, in 2017, 35 breeding pairs were subsequently observed, with confirmed recolonisation in the Alentejo Region of Portugal (Bowden and Botha 2017). The species has also been seen in Romania, Italian eastern Alps, and in northern France, as well as a recent record in a rehabilitation center in Jordan (Bowden and Botha 2017). Supplementary feeding programmes have been initiated in Spain and France to provide a safe, poison-free food source, although there are concerns that the species may be not very prone to feed at conventional feeding stations. Captive breeding populations have also been established (Tewes <em>et al.&#160;</em>1998). In the Balkans, the species has only one stable colony in the Dadia forest reserve in northern Greece, where WWF has long been involved. Supplementary food is also provided in Bulgaria for breeding birds<strong style=""""></strong> (Anon. 2007)<strong style=""""></strong> and South Korea during the winter, which may be the factor attracting birds from Mongolia (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong style=""""></strong>. In eastern Europe and central Asia, fewer conservation actions are known, although the species occurs within a number of protected areas in the region.

In Nepal&#160;in 2006, a ban was introduced on the production and importation of diclofenac for veterinary use and pharmaceutical firms were encouraged to promote a safe alternative called meloxicam (Swan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The use of diclofenac has since declined by 90% across parts of Nepal; however its complete elimination from the scavenger food chain has yet to be achieved (Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).&#160;The Government of Nepal endorsed the first Vulture Conservation Action Plan (VCAP) for Nepal (2009-13), and a second was launched in 2015.&#160;Approaches&#160;include: advocating additional bans on NSAIDs; continual education programmes; continual monitoring of NSAID use; swapping diclofenac with meloxicam; collection of veterinarian pledges to stop using diclofenac; operation, maintenance and expansion of vulture-safe feeding sites. Diclofenac-free Zones have been created in 46 Districts covering a total area of 101,160 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(68.73% ) of Nepal (DNPWC 2015).

Research threats, particularly the decline in abundance of prey species. Carry out reintroductions to link up the western and the eastern sub-areas of the present range, following the recommendations of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Black Vulture Conservation Foundation; possibly focusing on releasing immature individuals rather than juveniles because they can breed earlier and so lead to faster settlement and breeding in the wild (Mihoub <em>et al. </em>2014). Develop the captive breeding programme to support both this and future reintroduction and supplementation efforts. Restore wild rabbit <em style="""">Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> populations in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands (Spain) as this may help to increase food availability, particularly during the breeding period. Promote cooperation and information exchange among people working on the species, both at a national and international level. Remove drugs like diclofenac and other harmful NSAIDs from the environment and control the illicit use of human diclofenac for veterinary purpose (H. S. Baral and C. Inskipp&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Strengthen and enforce legislation regulating trade in pesticides that are used to poison meat baits. Increase the rate of prosecution and the severity of judicial sentences for illegal poisoning. Protect appropriate breeding habitat (e.g. Moreno-Opo <em>et al. </em>2013). Investigate the extent to which operational wind farms could affect major breeding populations such as core populations in the Balkans (Vasilakis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Provide effective protection to the Turkish population (the largest in the Western Palearctic), specifically during breeding seasons and investigate impact of demographic bottlenecks and low genetic diversity (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a, b). At the European level, to prevent ecological barriers, stronger integration is needed in environmental policies across political borders (Arrondo <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/>The European Species Action Plan for the Conservation of the Cinereous Vulture (2017) provides a comprehensive overview of the conservation and research actions necessary to conserve this species in Europe (Andevski <em>et al. </em>2017). In addition to the above, the plan recommends: reintroducing or restoring wild ungulate populations; increasing the monitoring of poisoning of vultures; improving legal measures to reduce poisoning incidents; banning lead ammunition; and raising public awareness of the risks to Cinereous Vultures and the positives of maintaining vulture populations.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Despite local declines, the global population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over 10 years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in 10 years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Some birds are migratory, overwintering in Africa, although many others are resident or nomadic (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). It relies heavily on soaring flight, and has been shown to fly at altitudes of 10,000 m and higher. Birds hunt alone but congregate at food sources and roosts; they also tend to migrate singly, but concentrations (usually up to 15 individuals) form at sea crossings and strong thermals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>It is a species of expansive open areas in a wide array of environments, from mountains to semi-desert, and is recorded regularly from sea level up to c.3,000&#160;m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>It feeds almost exclusively on carrion, mainly that of large mammals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is usually built on a rocky outcrop, with sheltered ledges or small caves preferred (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Effective protection in areas with a plentiful supply of food (which often includes the carrion of domestic animals), has been shown to catalyse impressive population recoveries, and reintroduction has been successful in parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","It declined markedly throughout the 19th–20th centuries in much of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, mainly due to direct persecution and ""bycatch"" from the poisoned carcasses set for livestock predators (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Direct persecution has decreased, although it may still be a threat in eastern Europe, Central Asia and possibly the Middle East (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). Unintentional poisoning through poison bates remains the most significant threat to the species (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017) - during 2000-2010 2,146 Griffon Vultures were found poisoned in Spain (RSPB 2014). In some areas a reduction in available food supplies, arising from changes in livestock management practices, also had an impact (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012) and electrocution has been identified as a threat (Global Raptors Information Network 2015). Disturbance caused by visitors may also pose a threat in some areas (Choresh <em>et al. </em>2019). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used for veterinary purposes pose a threat to this species. One case of suspected poisoning caused by flunixin, an NSAID, was recorded in this species in 2012 in Spain (Zorrilla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015), and several more have occurred since (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2020). Diclofenac, a similar NSAID which has caused severe declines in&#160;<em>Gyps</em>&#160;vulture species across Asia, was authorised for veterinary use in Spain in 2013. Diclofenac was detected in livestock carcasses in the Iberian Peninsula between 2013 and 2019 (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2020), and in 2021 the first case of a vulture death in Europe due to ingestion of Diclofenac was confirmed (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;<p>There were widespread declines in the population of Griffon vultures throughout Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula during the 20th century (Carneiro <em>et al</em>. 2015). This is a result of the species ingesting toxins from the carcasses they feed on, which accumulate in their system and increase mortality rates. Most of the carcasses the species feeds on are high in toxins as they came through livestock management or hunting practises; lead bullet fragments are often ingested leading to a build-up of toxic levels of lead within the species. This was worsened in 2001 when the EU legislated against the disposal of livestock carcasses in the field to curb the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. This lowered food availability and forced some vultures to seek out food in areas including garbage dumps, where they risk ingesting further heavy metals. In an analysis of 121 wild vultures sampled on the Iberian Peninsula, every individual had lead present in its blood, ranging in concentration from 4.97 to 300.23 μg/dl. The declines are further worsened by the intentional, and illegal, poisoning of Griffon vultures, the largest cause of non-natural mortality in large birds of prey (Carneiro <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>","The European population is estimated at 34,800-44,700 pairs, which equates to 69,600-89,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).

For the wild population of the GCF, metamorphosis occurs between 14 to 25 days (Canals-Mora, 1990).&#160; Temperature and water level affect the time to metamorphosis (Cáceres-Charneco 2018). The GCF population breed in a temporary pond that is also affected by water salinity. Exposure to water salinity affects time to metamorphosis and survivorship (Cáceres-Charneco 2018). In the artificial rearing ponds, other abiotic factors like cooler temperatures and high pH could influence tadpoles (Cáceres-Charneco and Ortiz-Zayas 2019).&#160; Other tadpole species that can be found in the ponds with&#160;<em>P. lemur</em>&#160;include the native Caribbean White Lipped frog (<em>Leptodactylus albilabris</em>) and the introduced giant marine toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>).<br/><br/>After metamorphosis, metamorphs will gather close to the pond edge and can be found clustered under leaflitter or fallen logs (USFWS 2015).&#160; Once toadlets leave the ponds, they move to the forest and search for refuges on limestone rock or holes in the ground (Pacheco and Barber 2013).&#160; The longest distance travelled by metamorph was 14 to 19 m in one night (USFWS 2015). Juveniles have not been followed for longer periods than two months after they metamorphose and not much is known after they leave the pond (Cáceres-Charneco 2018).<br/><br/>As for adults, reproduction occurs shortly after heavy rainfall events (Canals-Mora 1990, Rivero 1998, Lugo et al. 2001). For the GCF population, most of their reproduction events occur during the wet season (August to November), but reproduction can also occur from mid spring until summer (April to July) (CBSG 2006 and M. Canals-Mora, published and unpublished data). The reintroduced populations in the north are not as precipitation limited as the southern population, as reproduction has been documented in El Tallonal and La Esperanza frequently.</p>","<span id=""docs-internal-guid-b2727cef-7fff-950f-c783-60cbcc1f8b5e""><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b2727cef-7fff-950f-c783-60cbcc1f8b5e"">Habitat  loss due to urban expansion was probably a major threat to the  historical and last documented locality on the north coast (Ross 2007;  Puerto Rico Red List Assessment Workshop 2020). There is some  small-scale agriculture still taking place that could affect the species  La Esperanza in Manatí (Puerto Rico Red List Assessment Workshop 2020).  The passing of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic  Stability Act (PROMESA) in 2016 to address Puerto Rico’s economic crisis  has created a new level of uncertainty about the future of public  protected areas on the island as control over decision-making is  transferred from local authorities to an unelected board of financial  managers (Snow 2017, Castro-Prieto<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2019).&#160;It is feared  that this change might favour economic activities that will facilitate  land use changes, driving the destruction and degradation of important  habitats, and negatively impacting both biodiversity and human  populations across Puerto Rico who depend on healthy and intact  ecosystems for survival (Puerto Rico Red List Workshop June 2020).<br/><br/>The Caribbean region shows evidence of climate warming at regional (Peterson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Stephenson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, IPCC 2018) and local scales (Burrowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Bhardwaj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Precipitation patterns are not as clear, but some studies have shown a significant drying trend (Nurse <em>et al.</em> 2001, Neelin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Bhardwaj<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;Breeding  events are related to heavy rainfall, any changes in rainfall patterns  that lead to more drought events put the species' reproduction and  survival at risk. The frequency of extreme events like hurricanes, heavy  rains, landslides, and droughts has increased significantly in the last  decade (Méndez-Lázaro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Oppenheimer&#160;<em>et al</em>.  2019) and may continue to rise in the future (IPCC 2014, 2018).&#160;Due to  characteristics intrinsic to their biology and physiology, patterns of  recent climate change in the Caribbean are expected to be unfavourable to  this species.&#160;Climate warming and drought have been associated with a  decrease in arthropods (Lister and Garcia 2018), an important food item  for frogs; however, there have been doubts regarding the methodology  used by Lister and Garcia (2018) (see Willig<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). The effects of climate change can also be associated with an increased risk of chytridiomycosis (Longo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010).<br/><br/>At  the GCF, breeding events are threatened by the proximity of natural  breeding ponds to the sea and by the historical and potentially ongoing  intrusion of saltwater (Cáceres-Charneco 2018). Water salinity values  over 6 ppt has adverse effects on the development and survival of  tadpoles of this species (Cáceres-Charneco 2018). Due to its proximity  to the sea, sea level rise associated with climate change is a concern  for the subpopulations occurring at Tamarindo pond at GCF and Punta  Ventana in Guayanilla (USFWS 2015). If individuals choose to breed at  the main ponds at Tamarindo and salinity levels are high (i.e. 8 ppt),  it is expected that the breeding events would have zero recruitment  (R.&#160;Cáceres-Charneco&#160;pers. comm. 2020). Increasing salt water intrusion  events (due to increasing sea level rise and tidal waves) could cause  local extirpation of these subpopulations (R.&#160;Cáceres-Charneco, A.  Puente and S. Vega pers. comms. 2020). Following Hurricane Maria in  2017, the&#160;Ciénaga wetlands in Yauco were flooded due to shifting  hydrology resulting in destruction of this species'  habitat&#160;(R.&#160;Cáceres-Charneco&#160;pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>In addition, competition and predation by the introduced giant marine toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>)  had been documented and identified as major threats, mainly on the  metamorph stage (Flores-Vallejo 2011,&#160;Cáceres-Charneco 2018).</p></span>","<span id=""docs-internal-guid-720e1c4f-7fff-cc36-4bb6-423735603aa6""><p>The species was last recorded on Virgin Gorda Island in 1964 and surveys since then have not located any individuals. One individual was found on St. John (U.S. Virgin Islands) in 1978, but it is currently believed to be extirpated from the island (Norton 1997, 1998; Platenberg and Boulon 2006). In Puerto Rico, all naturally occurring subpopulations have been extirpated from the northern portion of the island since 1988 (Johnson 1999, Ross 2007), with only three reproductive subpopulations persisting in southwest Puerto Rico:&#160;Guanica Commonwealth Forest (GCF), Ciénaga wetland in Yauco, and Punta Ventana in Guayanilla (USFWS 2015, Barber <em>et al. </em>2019). As part of the conservation strategies in place for this species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad has been re-introduced at six localities within its historical range: three in northern Puerto Rico (El Tallonal in Arecibo, Río Encantado in Ciales/Florida and La Esperanza in Manatí) and three in southern Puerto Rico (Manglillo Grande within the GCF, Gabia Farm in Coamo and&#160;Cueva&#160;El Convento in Guayanilla).<br/><br/>Population estimates for the species have been derived mainly from anecdotal reports and the number of toads observed during reproductive events or single night surveys (USFWS 2015). By 1992, when the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) approved the recovery plan for the species, the population size was estimated at ca. 2,000 individuals (USFWS 1992). Between 1984 and 2016, 53 reproduction events were confirmed for the Tamarindo natural pond at GCF (Cáceres-Charneco 2018). The greatest number of toads reported in a single breeding event was 2,224 toads when G. Ross and M. Canals reported 1,444 males and 780 females at the GCF (USFWS 2015). Although there are no specific numbers, the population in GCF is considered stable based on the frequency of reproductive events and observations of individuals.&#160;The subpopulation at Punta Ventana in Guayanilla appears to be relatively stable because adults can found outside of the breeding season and during the dry season, however the population status needs to be verified by further surveys&#160;(R.&#160;Cáceres-Charneco and A. Puente pers. comms. 2020).<br/><br/>There are no population estimates for the six re-introduction sites, but acoustic monitoring efforts in four of these sites (El Tallonal,&#160;La Esperanza,&#160;Manglillo Grande and&#160;Cueva&#160;El Convento) during breeding events and tadpole release events indicate that species is successfully breeding thus far (R.&#160;Cáceres-Charneco, A. Puente and S. Vega pers. comms. 2020). In&#160;captivity, the population consists of about 900 adult toads on average (USFWS 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"The Puerto Rican Crested Toad has been described as endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, the island of Puerto Rico and Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands.&#160;The species is considered to be Extinct at Virgin Gorda, however (Perry and Gerber 2006).&#160;Anecdotal reports suggest that the species also used to occur on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas and St. John, and on the Isla de Vieques in Puerto Rico (USFWS 2015), however no museum specimens exist (R. Cáceres Charneco, A. Puente and S. Vega pers. comms. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In Puerto Rico, its historical distribution is limited to the northern and southern karst regions, from sea level up to 50 m asl. Historically the species was collected from the municipalities of Bayamón, Vega Baja, Barceloneta, Arecibo,&#160;Quebradillas,&#160;Isabela, Coamo, Santa Isabel, Ponce,&#160;Guayanilla, Yauco, and&#160;Guánica&#160;(Schmidt 1928, Schwartz and Henderson 1991, Rivero 1998, Joglar 2005,&#160;USFWS 2015). Currently, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad is known from only three naturally occurring subpopulations along the southern coast of Puerto Rico, located less than 4 km apart: 1) Guanica Commonwealth Forest (GCF); 2) Ciénaga wetland in Yauco; and 3) Punta Ventana in Guayanilla (USFWS 2015; Barber <em>et al. </em>2019). It has also been re-introduced at six sites: 1) El Tallonal in Arecibo; 2) Río Encantado in Ciales/Florida; 3) La Esperanza in Manatí (all in northern Puerto Rico); 4) Manglillo Grande within the GCF; 5) Gabia Farm in Coamo; and 6) Cueva&#160;El Convento (El Convento Natural Protected Area)&#160;in Guayanilla (all in southern Puerto Rico). The extent of occurrence (EOO), based on the distribution of the extant population, is 2,352 km<sup>2 </sup>and its area of occupancy (AOO) is smaller than 100 km<sup>2</sup>.",There are no records of this species being utilized.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions In-Place</em></strong><br/>The only naturally occurring population is restricted to southern Puerto Rico and divided in three subpopulations, with the largest subpopulation occurring within the GCF where the habitat is relatively well-managed through co-management of the community and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER).&#160;A captive breeding programme has been implemented since 1992, and over 500,000 tadpoles have been released into the reintroduced sites.&#160;Captive-born adults can often be observed using the artificial ponds for breeding and successful reproductive events has been documented in four of the six reintroduction sites (El Tallonal, Hacienda La Esperanza, Manglillo Grande and Cueva El Convento).

species is potentially susceptible to chytridiomycosis, as some subpopulations are associated with streams and the amphibian chytrid fungus,&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, has recently been recorded in this species (López-Torres&#160;and Longo 2013, Longo <em>et al.</em> 2020). Soft ticks (<em>Carios</em> spp.) have been found on this species and individuals were observed to be lethargic, but the severity of this threat remains unknown (Vega-Castillo 2000, Longo<em> et al. </em>2020).<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>The Caribbean region shows evidence of climate warming at regional (Peterson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Stephenson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, IPCC 2018) and local scales (Burrowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Bhardwaj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Precipitation patterns are not as clear, but some studies have shown a significant drying trend (Nurse<em> et al.</em> 2001, Neelin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Bhardwaj<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). The frequency of extreme events like hurricanes, heavy rains, and droughts has increased significantly in the last decade (Méndez-Lázaro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Oppenheimer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) and may continue to rise in the future (IPCC 2014, 2018). Due to characteristics intrinsic to their biology and physiology, patterns of recent climate change in the Caribbean are expected to be unfavorable to this species (Puerto Rico Red List&#160;Assessment&#160;Workshop 2020). Climate warming and drought have been associated with a decrease in arthropods (Lister and Garcia 2018), an important food item for frogs; however, there have been doubts regarding the methodology used by Lister and Garcia (2018) (see Willig<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019).

The introduced Cuban Tree Frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) is a generalist predator that may include coquis in its diet, however the proportion of amphibians found in stomach content analysis (3.5%) is also low (Glorioso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).

region shows evidence of climate warming at regional (Peterson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Stephenson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, IPCC 2018) and local scales (Burrowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Bhardwaj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Precipitation patterns are not as clear, but some studies have shown a significant drying trend (Nurse <em>et al. </em>2001, Neelin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Bhardwaj<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). The frequency of extreme events like hurricanes, heavy rains, landslides, and droughts has increased significantly in the last decade (Méndez-Lázaro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Oppenheimer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) and may continue to rise in the future (IPCC 2014, 2018).&#160;Due to characteristics intrinsic to their biology and physiology, patterns of recent climate change in the Caribbean are expected to be unfavorable to this species, and the increasing frequency, severity and duration of&#160;hurricanes are especially detrimental to it (Puerto Rico Red List Assessment Workshop 2020).&#160;Climate warming and drought have been associated with a decrease in arthropods (Lister and Garcia 2018), an important food item for frogs; however, there have been doubts regarding the methodology used by Lister and Garcia (2018) (see Willig<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). The effects of climate change can also be associated with an increased risk of chytridiomycosis (Longo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010).<span

In El Verde Field Station, the species was relatively common prior to 1990, but is now locally extinct (Campos and Aide 2017). A 7% declining trend has been observed on a single study site in El Yunque National Forest from 1996 to 2020 (R. Joglar and A.

However, it should be noted that the population within the Murray-Darling basin is probably in decline and of conservation concern.","This species inhabits the vegetated margins of rivers, lakes, creeks and swamps (Allen and Burgess 1990). It is usually found in waters ~1 m deep, with little or no flow, near overhanging vegetation, and especially in backwaters (Hansen 1999). It is most commonly found amongst logs, dead branches and macrophytes (Allen 1996).<br/><br/>Both males and females are mature at one year of age, live for two to four years, and females live longer than males. Spawning occurs from October to December, when water temperature reaches 22–23°C. Fecundity is usually 200–700 eggs, although a 49 mm long female has been reported to contain 2,350 eggs. The eggs are small (0.7 mm diameter), adhesive and attach to aquatic plants and rocks on the stream bed. Hatching occurs in five to seven days at 22°C, and larvae are approximately 3 mm long at hatching (Pusey <em>et al. </em>2004).","This species has suffered reduced distribution and abundance within its range in the Murray-Darling Basin (Harris and Gehrke 1997). It is most likely that a combination of various environmental pressures has led to the decline. The decline in aquatic macrophytes, removal of woody debris, associated pressures of alien species (particularly Eastern Gambusia and Redfin Perch), thermal pollution and the loss of the natural flow regime have all contributed to the removal of this species from most floodplain and riverine habitats within the Murray-Darling Basin (Morris <em>et al.</em> 2001).","This species has experienced significant declines across much of historical range in the Murray-Darling Basin.

The estimated extent of occurrence is 56,647 km<sup>2</sup> by minimum convex polygon and the area of occupancy is estimated at 42,155 km<sup>2</sup> using a 2x2 km grid overlay within a coastal buffer 2 km from the shore. The population size is poorly known and crudely estimated as low as 33,000 total iguanas after a strong El Niño famine and as many as 350,000 after several years of La Niña abundant food conditions, with fewer than 210,000 mature individuals. Current taxonomy describes eleven subspecies. Only one subspecies has a genetically resilient effective population size, and only one more is close to the threshold to be considered healthy; the remaining are critically low to moderate. Overall population trend is unknown, but is subject to extreme fluctuations and reductions during El Niño events (10–90% mortality), which are predicted to intensify in the future with ongoing climate change.<br/><br/>Marine Iguana populations have been reduced by invasive alien predators such as feral cats, rats, and free-roaming pigs and dogs on five of the 13 main islands (<em>ca</em>&#160;30% of the total population). These iguanas are threatened by a region-wide increase in human population and visitation that has multiplied the impacts from stress, marine pollution including oil and diesel spills, habitat degradation, and chance of further invasive species introductions and emergent diseases. Land-based tourist presence and intensity has been shown to have a significant overall negative effect on iguana health. Overall population trends are difficult to estimate without comprehensive population size monitoring data, however, the multitude of known anthropogenic threats found across the archipelago are sufficient to support an estimate of an overall population reduction of at least 30% over the last three generations. Without significant invasive species control and enhanced protection from marine pollution, declines are projected to continue in the near future, exacerbated by increasingly frequent and severe El Niño events and human impacts that affect all populations. We estimate that the per cent reduction over the past two generations and one generation into the future (<em>ca</em> 18–24 years) will also be at least 30%. This species qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","Marine Iguanas are the only lizard species that forage in the ocean. Adults and juveniles occur on rocky coasts and intertidal zones. Adult females can be found nesting up to 2 km inland and adult males can be found foraging in marine waters, up to depths of 30 m. They feed almost exclusively on marine algae, primarily three red genera (<em>Centroceras</em>, <em>Gelidium</em>, <em>Pterocladia</em>; Rubenstein and Wikelski 2003) and the green algal genus <em>Ulva</em> when exposed during low tides (Shepherd and Hawkes 2005). The majority of iguanas graze intertidally, though the largest iguanas of each colony also dive beneath the sea surface to forage on offshore algal beds (30 m offshore, 2–30 m depth; Buttemer and Dawson 1993, Wikelski and Trillmich 1994). Some iguana populations have been known to supplement their algal diet with highly salty land plants, primarily Saltwort (<em>Batis maritima</em>), but also other coastal succulents such as <em>Sesuvium portulacastrum</em> (Wikelski and Wrege 2000).<br/><br/>Marine Iguanas exhibit high morphological diversity, including substantial body size and shape variation among populations and sexes (Chiari <em>et al</em>. 2016). Males are larger, with different head morphology than females and more pronounced spines on the head and along the back. Average body size (snout-to-vent length) is 260 mm (range 120–490 mm; Miralles <em>et al</em>. 2017). Adult males weigh approximately 70% more than adult females (Laurie and Brown 1990a). Differences in maximum body size across islands is likely due to variability in algal productivity and sea surface temperature between islands (Wikelski and Trillmich 1997, Wikelski and Romero 2003, Wikelski 2005).<br/><br/>Reproduction occurs once a year during a month-long mating season, coinciding with the highest abundance and best nutritional quality of food (Rubenstein and Wikelski 2003). Nutrient-rich upwellings from the Humboldt and Cromwell currents affect all islands differently, so mating occurs at different times across the archipelago, varying somewhat from year to year. During this time males tend to become more colourful.<br/><br/>Marine Iguanas are the only lizard known to use a lek mating system, in which dominant males defend small territories (without resources beyond themselves) from other males. Male mating success is highly skewed to a few individuals and depends on body size, condition, and head-bob courtship behaviour. A single territorial male may be responsible for 35% of copulations on a lek (Trillmich 1983; Wikelski <em>et al</em>. 1996, 2001). Non-territorial males roam the periphery and try to force copulations with females, although they are rarely successful (Wikelski and Bäurle 1996). “Sneaker” males (physically small and resembling females) occupy the territories and also try to force copulations with females, which is also almost never successful.<br/><br/>Around four weeks after mating, females seek out and defend suitable sandy areas for digging burrows (Rauch 1988). Females lay 1–6 eggs (most commonly 2–3), which is highly dependent on female body condition and food availability (see subspecies <em>cristatus</em>, <em>hassi</em>, and <em>trillmichi</em> for additional data). Eggs are left to incubate for three months (Laurie 1990; Laurie and Brown 1990a, 1990b). Individual female iguanas typically reproduce once every two years (Vitousek 2009), or annually during periods of high food abundance (Laurie 1990). Hatchlings emerge at a body mass of <em>ca</em> 50 g (Trillmich and Trillmich 1986).","Marine Iguanas are threatened by extreme fluctuations in population size caused by periodic El Niño events (30–50% average mortality in the region, and up to 90% are known). Deaths are due to starvation following a rapid temperature-driven change in the algal community (Wikelski <em>et a</em>l. 1996). During El Niño events, warm water from the Gulf of Panama flows toward the Galápagos and the nutrient upwelling is suppressed, which results in the proliferation of brown algae (e.g., <em>Giffordia mitchelliae</em>) that is not easily digestible by iguanas and may be toxic. The largest animals of each subpopulation starve first (Wikelski and Trillmich 1997, Wikelski <em>et al</em>. 1997, Wikelski 2005) followed by smaller individuals during these periods. Food shortages during El Niño events can lead to the unusual phenomenon of shrinking in body length within just a few months (Wikelski and Thom 2000), apparently facilitated by absorption of their own bone matter. Predictions that climate change may increase the severity and frequency of El Niño events (Timmermann <em>et al</em>. 1999, Cai <em>et al</em>. 2014) suggest that some subpopulations could be removed entirely.<br/><br/>On several large islands (Isabela, Santiago, Santa Cruz and Baltra, Floreana, San Cristóbal) and satellite cays, there is an ongoing significant threat to Marine Iguanas from invasive alien predators, particularly cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) and rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>, <em>R. norwegicus</em>), as well as free-roaming domestic dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>, Kruuk and Snell 1981) and pigs (<em>Sus domesticus;</em>&#160;Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). For several decades, the presence of cats has been associated with a lack of hatchling and juvenile Marine Iguanas (Laurie 1983, Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994, MacLeod and Steinfartz 2016). Predation has also been directly confirmed at several locations on Isabela and Santa Cruz (Laurie 1983, Konecny 1983). The survival of hatchlings in colonies affected by predators is alarmingly low: 1% at a cat-affected colony on Santa Cruz compared to 53% at an unaffected colony on Santa Fe (Laurie 1983). Rats likely pose the most significant threat to young Marine Iguanas on islands where other food sources for the rats are scarce as on the small cays (e.g., Pinzón, Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994). The total adult population of iguanas on affected islands is estimated at&#160;<em>ca</em> 7,100–57,000 which constitutes <em>ca</em> 20 and 30% of the total adult iguana population.<br/><br/>The Galápagos has seen a dramatic recent increase in both tourists and residents living on the islands and adversely affecting the ecosystem. Approximately 25,000 people live among five islands (Toral-Granda <em>et al</em>. 2017), though this figure likely does not include illegal residents seeking work in the tourism industry. The total number of tourists arriving in Galápagos each year has also increased from 11,765 in 1979 to 224,755 tourists in 2015, a 19-fold increase. Between 2000 and 2015, average annual tourism growth was 8.2% and the number of sites visited has increased to 169. The nature of tourism has also changed, from being historically boat-based, to now being significantly land-based (on the inhabited islands) (Toral-Granda <em>et al</em>. 2017). Tourist presence and intensity has been shown to have a significant overall negative effect on immunological capability, endocrine response, and oxidative stress in Marine Iguanas (French <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2017).<br/><br/>Cargo ship traffic has risen to supply the larger resident and tourist population, and this has brought an increase in various types of pollution, habitat degradation, and an increased chance of invasive terrestrial species introductions and emergent mosquito-borne diseases. Additionally, the potential for aquatic invaders on ship hulls and in ballast water may pose a threat to the Marine Iguanas’ food supply (Toral-Granda <em>et al</em>. 2017). An unusual mortality (62% loss) on Santa Fé was recorded in 2001 following a diesel and oil spill from a tanker that ran aground near the island of San Cristóbal (Wikelski <em>et al</em>. 2002). Other subpopulations may have well been affected, but this was not recorded due to lack of long-term monitoring for most islands. Notable is that just trace amounts of oil around Santa Fé caused this mortality, indicating the extreme sensitivity of Marine Iguanas to such pollution. It is thought that the symbiotic bacteria within the gut of the iguanas that are essential for proper digestion (Mackie <em>et al</em>. 2004) were negatively affected/removed by this exposure, resulting in the iguanas being unable to digest their food. Several other diesel and oil spills have occurred since 2001 on Santa Cruz and San Cristóbal.<br/><br/>On islands with permanent human settlements (Santa Cruz, San Cristóbal, Isabela, and Floreana), municipal waste incineration of organic waste and plastics in open dump areas is a potential source of unintentionally), municipal waste incineration of organic waste and plastics in open dump areas is a potential source of unintentionally-produced persistent organic pollutants such as dioxins and furans. Over 50% of the currently used pesticides applied in the agriculture zone were identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, underscoring potential health effects in the endemic fauna (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2014). Widespread marine plastic debris and micro-plastic pollution may be an emerging threat to Marine Iguanas and their food source.","Only very rough estimates of population size are available for the entire population of Marine Iguanas. They are noted to be as low as 33,000 total individuals after a strong El Niño famine and as many as 350,000 after several years of La Niña abundant food conditions (Wikelski and Nelson 2004). Little is known regarding current mature adult numbers, but it is estimated to be under 210,000 based on calculations indicating that 60% of the maximum total population are adults (Laurie 1983, Laurie and Brown 1990a, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Average generation length is five years for females and 12 years for males (6–8 years is used for calculations). Approximately 20–30% of the total population (<em>ca</em> 10,000–73,000) is estimated to be declining due to the continual impacts of invasive alien predators. Sharp declines relating to these threats have been reported since the early 1980s (Laurie 1983, Jacome 1989, Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994, Wikelski and Nelson 2004, MacLeod and Steinfartz 2016); covering a period of well over three generations. A severe absence of younger iguanas in some colonies has been observed, most notably on Floreana, Isabela, Santa Cruz, and San Cristóbal (Laurie 1983).<br/><br/>Recent genetic analysis indicates that the subpopulations (subspecies) show a variable effective population size, from critically low (<em>A. c. godzilla</em>) to healthy (<em>A. c. cristatus</em>) (range: 37–2,388; MacLeod and Steinfartz 2016). Subspecies with very low values may show consequences of inbreeding and have reduced ability to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions (N<sub>e</sub> &gt; 1,000 minimum; Frankham <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Populations undergo extreme fluctuations by cyclic, but unpredictably recurring, famine (El Niño) and feast (La Niña) events. El Niño events dramatically reduce the abundance, diversity, and nutritional value of available marine algae, as the iguanas are unable to digest the algae that grows during these periods (Trillmich and Trillmich 1986). Population declines are strongly density-dependent: the higher the population density, the higher the mortalities during El Niños (from 10–90%). Population recovery after El Niños can be rapid if food resources are available again, as individuals grow faster, reproduce more frequently and lay more eggs (Laurie and Brown 1990a).<br/><br/>The lack of population size monitoring data presents a challenge when assessing the overall population trajectory. However, surveys in the 1980s noted that the species was in danger of extirpation on several islands (Laurie 1983) and subsequent work noted a further decline (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994). In 2002, the number of iguanas on San Cristóbal, Santa Cruz, and Santiago was noted to be significantly less than expected (Snell and Márquez 2002). Indeed, the multitude of known and predicted future anthropogenic threats found across the archipelago are sufficient to support a finding of an overall population reduction of at least 30% over the last four decades. Without significant invasive species control and enhanced protection from marine pollution, declines are projected to increase in the future, exacerbated by increasingly frequent and severe El Niño events that affect all populations.",Decreasing,"The Marine Iguana occurs on the large islands of Española, Fernandina, Floreana, Genovesa, Isabela, Marchena, Pinta, San Cristobál, Santa Cruz, Santa Fé, and Santiago, the mid-sized islands of Baltra, Bartolomé, Pinzón, Plaza Norte, Plaza Sur, Rábida, and Seymour Norte, smaller key populations on Darwin, Roca Redonda, and Wolf, as well as many satellite islets of the Galápagos Archipelago, Ecuador. This species has an extent of occurrence of 56,647 km<sup>2</sup> by minimum convex polygon enclosing all subpopulations, that includes the far distant small islands of Darwin and Wolf. A minimum convex polygon enclosing just the central islands (without Darwin and Wolf) of occurrence is 42,155 km<sup>2</sup>. Marine Iguanas are found within 2 km of the coast with a total area of occupancy of 4,368 km<sup>2</sup>, using a 2x2 km grid overlay in this coastal zone. They are found near (&lt; 200 m asl) and below sea level at depths up to 30 m (large adult males).","This species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Wildlife trafficking is the third most profitable illegal activity in the world, and although Ecuador has never declared export of live specimens of <em>Amblyrhynchus cristatus</em> for commercial trade (CITES trade data, UNEP-WCMC 2018), they are known to exist in the pet trade. Four smuggling cases with prosecutions occurred between 2010 and 2015 (Auliya <em>et al</em>. 2016). While not significantly reducing the population currently, their entry into the pet trade is of concern.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The entire Marine Iguana distribution is included in three protected areas: Galápagos National Park and National Marine Reserve, Galápagos Islands Man and Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO), and Galápagos Islands World Heritage Site. Because the Galápagos is a high tourism area, it has attracted large numbers of migrants from the Ecuadorian mainland seeking tourist industry jobs. To curb population increase, Ecuador enacted a new law (Ley Orgánica de Régimen Especial para la Conservación y Desarrollo Sustentable de la Provincia de Galápagos: LOREG) requiring a special visa to visit the Galápagos, and there are strict limits on who can move there permanently (Strahm and Patry 2010).<br/><br/>Several eradication programmes have occurred in the Galápagos, including feral goats from several islands, cats from Baltra and Venecia, and Black Rats from Seymour Norte and Bainbridge #4 (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). Increased efforts to eradicate or control cats, dogs, rats, and pigs to benefit all subpopulations of Marine Iguanas is sorely needed. The impact of rats is less well understood, however, it was documented that more hatchlings than normal were observed following a nearly complete eradication of Black Rats from Pinzón in 1988 (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Conservation and research actions recommended for the species include an improved knowledge of population size, trends, distribution, factors limiting population size, habitat trends, and invasive species management. Some populations are of particular conservation concern and further research on the impact of low effective population size is recommended. Research to understand the impact of warming waters (climate change and El Niño) on individual algae species, along with other factors affecting algae community composition and iguana foraging dynamics, is recommended (Shepherd and Hawks 2005, Vinueza <em>et al</em>. 2006, Tomkins and Wolff 2017). An increased understanding of the effect of widespread oceanic pollution, including oil spills and micro-plastics, on Marine Iguanas and their micro-biota (which enable effective digestion) is also needed. Plastic debris ranks as one of the most abundant and persistent solid wastes at sea and shorelines, representing 25% of the total marine debris collected during beach cleanups in the Galápagos (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2014). Improved biosecurity measures to prevent disease introductions, such as West Nile Virus, avian malaria, and other are also recommended. Ongoing monitoring for introduced pathogens in Galápagos reptiles and other fauna is needed (Bataille <em>et al</em>. 2009; Eastwood <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2014).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It is known from one threat-defined location; its population may be severely fragmented; there is a continuing decline in the quality of its habitat at the most important known site; and also a likely ongoing decline in the number of mature individuals due to heavy predation pressure by the waterbird population in the Hula Valley area. The largest known subpopulation consists of fewer than 250 mature individuals and this may represent the majority of the surviving population; consequently this species may be close to, or may qualify for, listing under criterion C1. The effective population size is considerably lower, and potentially below 50 individuals.","Observations related to the rediscovery suggest that this species may be more terrestrial than initially thought (S. Gafny pers. comm. March 2012). Adults are mainly nocturnal and burrow into ""moist detritus"" (Renan <em>et al.</em> 2017), although adults remain around and can be found in the water during the presumed February-September breeding season (Perl <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, 2018). Perl <em>et al. </em>(2017) found adults in the Hula Nature Reserve only in areas of peaty soil beneath deep (20-30 cm) leaf litter in areas of dense vegetation. Renan&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2017) conducted habitat suitability modelling based on presence-absence surveys using environmental DNA. Their results suggested that the species is concentrated in southern and western areas of the Hula Valley whose original (pre-1950s) habitat was lake or swamp (and which retains dense vegetation cover which may provide important movement corridors during the breeding season). Extant subpopulations appear to be associated with reservoirs and waterbodies in arable land and orchards on organic and colluvial-alluvial soils (Renan <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sites with positive detections ranged from small ponds to large pools and included both lotic and lentic waterbodies (Renan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017), although it is unclear whether rain pools are significant for reproduction as it appears to be associated with permanent water sources (Perl&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The Yesod HaMa'ala ditch is supplied by a permanent spring and characterized by dense vegetation both within and around the water (Perl&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).<br/><br/>It is a larval-developing species, and its advertisement call is described by Perl <em>et al</em>. (2017). Recent records of very small juveniles and the difficulty of detecting tadpoles suggest that this species may have a short larval period (Renan <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>On average, females of this species can be 6.9-12.4 cm in size, and males 6.66-12.84 cm (Perl&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017)<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>","The Huleh marshes were drained in the 1950s in an attempt to both eradicate malaria and to make the land suitable for agricultural use. Of the original 6,000 ha of marshland, only 300 ha (3 km²<sup></sup>) remained after drainage. The remaining wetland was set aside as a nature reserve - the Hula Nature Reserve - in 1964. While the reserve is well-managed, it functions as a refuge for many water birds, possibly more than used to be in the original swamp, and predation pressure is thought to be very high and a real threat to a small amphibian population comprised of few individuals (S. Gafny pers. comm. March 2012). This appears to be supported by high rates of injury recorded among adults in Yesod HaMa'ala, and may reflect predation attempts by both native species and invasive species such as mosquitofish (Perl <em>et al. </em>2017). In addition, most of the area surrounding the reserve is cultivated (S. Gafny pers. comm. March 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The majority of the known extant population appears to occur in Yesod HaMa'ala, an unprotected locality which is subject to varied threats including pollution (pesticide pollution, petrol spills, and high levels of plastic and metal waste - Perl <em>et al. </em>2017), habitat alteration and desiccation (S. Gafny pers. comm. 2020), and the species remains ""one of the most endangered vertebrates on earth"" (Renan <em>et al</em>. 2017). The species' apparent survival throughout the former area of the Hula swamp suggests that it may exhibit some resilience to high levels of habitat modification so long as breeding sites survive, although likely at reduced densities (Renan <em>et al. </em>2017). It is likely that these remnant subpopulations survive in suboptimal habitat, increasing the risk of recruitment failure (Renan<em> et al</em>. 2017). The species appears to be closely tied to waterbodies and to remain close to water year-round, limiting its dispersal capabilities and increasing its sensitivity to highly localized environmental changes that impact these sites (Perl <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Samples of this species have tested positive for the amphibian chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, but no signs of chytridiomycosis have been detected and the species appears to exhibit some innate immunity (Perl <em>et al.</em> 2017).","Prior to this frog's rediscovery in 2011 (Rinat 2011), it had not been recorded since 1955 and was the first amphibian species to be listed as Extinct on the IUCN Red List. Surveys of potentially suitable habitat had been undertaken, including in the Aammiq marsh (the only remaining  wetland fragment of the Bekaa valley) of nearby  southeast Lebanon, but these failed to locate any  animals there (Tron and Duguet 2004, Tron 2005). Until its rediscovery, only three adult specimens and two tadpoles were known to science (S. Gafny pers. comm. March 2012).&#160;The species has proven to be difficult to detect using traditional observation and acoustic survey methods, and only 34 individuals were recorded prior to the study conducted by Renan<em> et al.</em> (2017).&#160;Most recent specimens have been taken from the unprotected subpopulation in Yesod HaMa'ala, which has an estimated total population size of 233-244 potentially breeding adults (which may be an overestimate) but an effective population size of only 16.5-35.8 individuals (based on mark-recapture data from 118 sampled adults - Peri<em> et al</em>. 2018). There is very little information on the status of the Hula Nature Reserve subpopulation (S. Gafny pers. comm. 2020). The study conducted by Renan <em>et al. </em>(2017) recorded a ""small reduction"" in positive site detections between spring 2015 and spring 2016; this corresponded to observed reductions in tadpole numbers in other amphibian species and may reflect a bad breeding year. This species exhibits low dispersal capabilities (marked individuals all travelled no more than 100 m, and most less than 10 m over an 18 day period - Perl <em>et al</em>. 2017) and is unlikely to disperse through modified terrestrial habitats outside the nature reserve (Perl<em> et al.</em> 2018). These authors hypothesize that the high genetic diversity they record reflects either 'genetic rescue' during sporadic flooding events, or the concentration of historically genetically distinct subpopulations within remnant habitat following land conversion. They further hypothesize that continued admixture between these genetic clusters may reflect low levels of recruitment. The population of this species may consequently be severely fragmented.",Decreasing,"In the 1940s this species was recorded from only two sites on the eastern shore of Lake Huleh, Israel. In 1955 the species was recorded again, in the northwest edge of the Hula swamps, just east of the extant 'En Agmon spring (Y. Werner pers. comm. March 2012), following partial reflooding of the valley (Perl <em>et al.</em> 2017). It was rediscovered in 2011 at 65 asl at a locality in the Hula Nature Reserve less than 5 km away from its former sites.&#160;<br/><br/>As of 2020, extant subpopulations were known only from two localities: the Hula Nature Reserve site (Perl&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017); and a site within a ditch (1.5 m wide and 600 m long) in the vicinity of Yesod HaMa'ala village detected in December 2013 (unmapped; Perl <em>et al.</em> 2017). This site is less than 2 km from the extant Hula Nature Reserve locality (S. Gafny pers. comm. 2020). The known global range covers an area of less than 6.5 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and surveys in the surrounding area suggest the species is genuinely endemic to the area of the former Hula swamps, but it is unknown how many active reproductive sites exist within this area (Perl<em> et al. </em>2017). This area is treated as a single threat-defined location.<br/><br/>An environmental DNA study reported evidence of this species' DNA in 18 additional waterbodies within Hula Nature Reserve and two adjacent reserves (Agamon Ha-Hula nature park and Ein Te'o nature reserve), but extensive surveys have not recorded specimens in any of these (S. Gafny pers. comm. 2020) and the eDNA results suggest that extant subpopulations are confined to a very restricted area in the south of the Hula Valley (Renan <em>et al</em>. 2017).

A restoration project aimed at improving both habitat quality and connectivity is strongly recommended, with priority given to establishing a corridor between the Yesod HaMa'ala subpopulation and Hula Nature Reserve (Perl&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).

Populations in both Ethiopia and South Africa are now thought to be extremely small (although it is unknown whether there is migration between the two areas).<br/><p></p>","<strong>Behaviour:&#160;</strong>The movements of this species are not fully understood, but the lack of subspeciation has been interpreted to imply that the birds migrate between the two subpopulations (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Dalton <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018), and DNA analyses suggest that the species may be migratory (Smit-Robinson 2014; C. Symes&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016; Dalton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). However the fact that there are overlaps in occurrence has prompted suggestions that strict migration is unlikely (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). One suggestion is that long-distance dispersal occurs when numbers are high (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998), with local movements being predominant at other times. Recent findings further support the presence of two subpopulations (South Africa and Ethiopia) that respond nomadically to niche availability (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a, b, c), and could potentially intermingle at disjunct central sites. In 2012 a survey was carried out in south-west Ethiopia during the non-breeding season to understand more about the possible movement of birds between Ethiopia and South Africa, but no birds were found (Drerup 2015). However, recent developments in the use of remote survey methodology have improved the ability to study this highly elusive species (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>, </em>2019). In Ethiopia birds that breed in the central highlands in June-September may move to lower-level habitats during the non-breeding season when the highland areas becomes unsuitable (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Similarly, in South Africa, birds are primarily present in the highland regions in October-March, with isolated low-altitude records outside of this peak period (April-August). This suggests that the species moves nomadically in response to changing niche conditions and could possibly use peat wetlands at lower elevations during the winter. Application of camera-acoustic survey methodology allowed for the successful confirmation of the vocalisations of this species, which is not very audible amongst other wetland and environmental sounds (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020b). In South Africa, the species arrived at highland wetlands shortly after the first large (c.50mm) rainfall in early to mid summer, displacing the resident Red-chested Flufftail in selected sedge dominant habitat patches (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019). Territorial activity commenced immediately, including visual and vocal displays (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019, 2020b).&#160;Visual displays include the voluntary display of white secondaries both when wings were tucked in and during extensive wing-flapping behaviour. These visual displays were noted together with peaks in vocalisations, which were conducted from first light through to 3 hours after sunrise (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020b), with most of the vocalisations done by males. Females were observed to be more active late-morning through to midday, while juveniles were more active during the late-morning and late-afternoon. Chicks fledge by mid-late summer (Colyn <em>et al. </em>2020b). Males may leave wetlands soon after the chicks have fledged, while females remained in wetlands later into summer, and juveniles could remain longer, until the end of March (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2020b).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat:&#160;</strong><em>Breeding</em>&#160;In Ethiopia the species breeds in high-altitude seasonal marshes (between 2,200 and 2,600 m) with dense, rapidly growing vegetation dominated by sedges, grasses and forbs (Taylor 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It occurs here when vegetation has reached 20-40 cm in height and the ground has not yet become entirely flooded (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). Very soon after hatching, it appears to move its chicks to areas of denser vegetation where the ground is more deeply and continuously flooded (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). The species may have specific microhabitat requirements that have not yet been established. In South Africa it inhabits moist to flooded peat-based habitats (mostly at 1,100-2,100 m) where vegetation is dense and dominated by sedges (<em>Carex </em>species), although it is occasionally found in pure stands of Typha and reeds (Davies&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015; Colyn <em>et al. </em>2019). It forages in mud at the edges of reed beds, in shallow water, in floating mats of aquatic vegetation and occasionally on dry ground (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Of the 10 important sites for the species in South Africa, 9 are within the Eastern Uplands, Great Escarpment Mountains and Highveld peatland ecoregions, emphasising the importance of peat-based habitats (Taylor and Grundling 2003)<strong></strong>. Occupancy results from South Africa suggest that increased basal and canopy cover, together with shallower water depths, were the primary factors influencing local occurrence (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019). Studies from Ethiopia showed that the significant drivers of nest site selection were vegetation cover, sedge cover, vegetation height, and water depth (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2020a). When cover was reduced, or the water levels increased, birds immediately abandoned respective sites.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet:&#160;</strong>It feeds on seeds and vegetation as well as insects, spiders, earthworms, small frogs and small fish (De Smidt 2003; see Taylor <em>et al. </em>2018).<strong> </strong>The stomach contents of a deceased chick included coleoptera (Dystiscidae) imagines, Diptera larvae (Tipulidae and Tabanidae), and the remains of small crustaceans.<br/>&#160; <strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>Nests found in Ethiopia are described as a ball of woven live sedge, <em>Eleocharis </em>or<em> Cyperus</em>, and other plant stems and vegetation, with clutches of 4-6 eggs (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004; Allan <em>et al.</em> 2006). Observations at a nest found in August 1999 resulted in an estimated incubation period of 15-16 days.<p></p>","Seasonal marshes are threatened by drainage (for cultivation and forestry), flooding by dams, catchment erosion, water abstraction, human disturbance, too-frequent burning, and excessive trampling and grazing by livestock and cutting of marsh vegetation for fodder (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019,&#160;2020a)<strong></strong>. Observations in Ethiopia suggest that the species moves its chicks very soon after hatching to areas of denser vegetation and deeper flooding before the vegetation at nest sites has grown enough for cutting by local people (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). Grasses and sedges are cut for the culturally important Ethiopian coffee ceremony (De Smidt 2003). In Ethiopia, rapid population growth is resulting in habitat loss and degradation from increasing agricultural practices. Primary threats across the Sululta plain include over-grazing, mowing of wetland vegetation for fodder bale production, and traditional harvesting of vegetation. Currently, more than 90% of all suitable wetland catchments have been completely altered and lost (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Bilacha wetland has already been almost completely converted into agriculture, settlement  and grazing land. Suitable habitat at Weserbi wetland has been completely lost, and housing is spreading close to the remaining small  patch of wet grassland (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Even the  remaining core site, Berga Wetland, is highly threatened as  habitat degradation and  destruction continue unchecked despite attempts to improve the  conservation status of  the area. In addition to the existing overgrazing, trampling and grass  cutting, local people are encroaching  further down to the wetland, converting grassland for subsistence  agriculture and  dividing up small plots of land for grazing. Suitable habitat at Berga has already been reduced by more than 90% and is fragmenting further under land-use pressure (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a).&#160;The peatlands of South Africa are threatened by cultivation, afforestation, grazing, water abstraction, horticulture, peat fires, draining, headcut and donga erosion, siltation, fences and developments such as roads and dams (Taylor and Grundling 2003; Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020c)<strong></strong>. The primary current threat in South Africa is development pressure from the mining industry, agricultural activities, construction of weirs and dams, other sources of flooding, expansion of invasive alien vegetation, and inappropriate management activities such as too-frequent fires and heavy grazing (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020c). Genetic analysis suggests that this species may have a low genetic diversity, and so could be limited in its ability to cope with environmental changes (Dalton <em>et al. </em>2018). Climate change analyses suggest that this species is likely to be very vulnerable to climate change, with large sections of its highland breeding areas potentially contracting by 2050 (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c)<p></p>","The population in South Africa was previously estimated to be 235 birds, with at least a further 210-215 pairs in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 1998), i.e. probably 700 mature individuals in total. The species can only be reliably surveyed in the breeding season in Ethiopia, but surveys risk disturbing nesting and thus have been avoided in the past (Y. D. Adebe <em>in litt.</em> 2013). Nevertheless, the most recent surveys by Colyn <em>et al.</em> (2020a, b) using cameras and acoustic monitoring yielded upper-limit population densities of 1 pair/5.8 ha in Ethiopia, and 1 pair in 6.7 ha in South Africa. This produced population estimates of 55 pairs in Ethiopia, and c.58 pairs in South Africa, producing a global population estimate of c.226 mature individuals, placed here in the band 50-249 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species occurs in <strong>Ethiopia</strong>&#160;(Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Taylor 1998, 1999), and <strong>South Africa</strong> (ten sites in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga [De Smidt 2003], and it can occur at low, coastal altitudes [Davies <em>et al. </em>2015]). There are also historical sightings from&#160;<strong>Zimbabwe </strong>(Colyn <em>et al. </em>2019)&#160;(only a very limited number of accepted records from the 1970s and 1980s [Hustler and Irwin 1995;&#160;<strong></strong>Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Ewbank 2014], and a possible breeding record in the 1950s [Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Taylor 1999]),&#160;and there is little to no recent information about the species's status there. Claimed records from Zambia and Rwanda are unproven (Taylor and van Perlo 1998; F. Dowsett-Lemaire and R. J. Dowsett <em>in litt. </em>1999; P. Leonard <em> in litt. </em>1999). In South Africa, the total population was estimated to be 235 birds by Taylor and van Perlo (1998), but the area of occupancy has since been estimated at 3.92 km<sup>2 </sup>in South Africa (150 ha across the Dullstroom area, 50 ha at Wakkerstroom, the only two recently reliable site) (R. Colyn&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020), and due to low confidence in past estimates and continued threats to the species and its habitat over the past 10 years, the regional population in South Africa may be fewer than 50 birds (Evans <em>et al. </em>2015). <br/><br/>In South Africa, a new site was discovered in 2002 in northern coastal KwaZulu-Natal, following speculation that the species no longer occurred in coastal areas, and further sightings at various location in Free State and KwaZulu-Natal have since been made (Taylor and Grundling 2003; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;In the Ethiopian highlands, 10-15 pairs bred at Sululta in the late 1990s (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; Anon. 1997; J. S. Ash <em>in litt. </em>1999) and c.200 pairs were discovered at a new breeding site (Berga floodplain) in 1997 (Anon. 1997;&#160;<strong></strong>A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998; M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007<strong></strong><strong></strong>). In 2005, a small breeding population was discovered at Bilacha in Ethiopia (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Although Weserbi hosted 10-15 pairs in 2003 (Allan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004), subsequent surveys have failed to record any evidence of presence at this site (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a).&#160;A recent study assessing the available habitat for this species across the Sululta area found the majority of remaining wetland sites were not in a suitable state for this species (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a). Berga Wetland hosts the majority of the remaining habitat for this species across the region, with 61% (158 ha) in the upper reaches, and 37% (71 ha) in the lower reaches. Weserbi is currently unsuitable due to over-grazing and mowing, but should this area improve, it could contribute a further 85 ha of breeding habitat (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a). Bilacha Wetland has been completely fragmented and degraded due to agricultural activities, and currently provides only 1 ha of suitable habitat.<br/><br/>Whether a single population migrates between Ethiopia and South Africa, or each country hosts its own subpopulation, is still not certain (Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Barnes 2000<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>), although observations from a breeding site in Ethiopia discovered in 2005 show that birds continue to breed into the dry season and may remain in Ethiopia after breeding, rather than migrate (A. Tefera <em>per</em> Anon. 2006), and genetic analyses possibly suggest the two subpopulations may intermingle (Dalton <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Recent research has found birds breeding in both Ethiopia (June-August) and South Africa (October-January) two months apart in the same year (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a, b). Suggestions  that the non-breeding grounds for the Ethiopian population could be within  south-west Ethiopia have not been substantiated; seven days of intensive surveys in the Kaffa area in April 2013 found no evidence of the species at seven major wetlands (M. Ewnetu <em>in litt. </em>2013). A recent study of the distribution and available habitat for the species across Africa confirmed that Ethiopia and South Africa hold the majority of suitable habitat, and that there are smaller areas located in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c).&#160;<br/><br/><strong></strong> <p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I and II. Some South African sites have some legal protection, and at least four sites are protected by the landowners (Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>. At the largest Ethiopian breeding population, the vegetation is not cut for fodder until October-November (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, thus giving the birds time to breed without disturbance (Anon. 1997). However, recent surveys by Colyn <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2020a) suggest that the efficacy of this management intervention is deteriorating under increased population growth and land-use pressure, resulting in increased habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation.One of the Ethiopian sites, Berga, is on a state-run dairy farm, and formerly so was Weserbi. The farm at Weserbi has been privatised, but the marsh still remains under the control of the central Dairy Farm Enterprise based in Addis Ababa (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. There is a Site Support Group at Berga, formed by the Ethiopian Wildlife and Natural History Society (De Smidt 2003).<strong>&#160;</strong>Support from organisations including the Middelpunt Wetland&#160;Trust helped to build a primary school (which is now named after the species) for the Berga community and the villagers acknowledge the value of the species (Drummond 2013), and a document is in preparation to formalise the Berga community project (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt. </em>2016). In South Africa, the Middelpunt Wetland Trust was formed in 1994 with the main objective of conserving the species and its habitat (De Smidt 2003; M. Drummond <em>in litt. </em>2005). In 2003, a partnership was formed to mitigate the effects of the Braamhoek (formally changed to Ingula) pumped storage scheme. Ingula has since been proclaimed as a nature reserve, and as such has secured some habitat for the species. Verloren Vallei, Seeikoeivlei and Ntsikeni Vlei are formally protected areas in South Africa, that currently host the majority of highly suitable habitat for the species (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c). In June 2003, a national Species Action Planning stakeholder workshop was held in Wakkerstroom, South Africa, to assess the threats facing the species in this country, and concluded with the agreement that a South African White-winged Flufftail Action Group be established (De Smidt 2003), which was formed by the Department of Environmental Affairs in South Africa in 2016 (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;<br/>An International Species Action Plan was published in 2008 (Sande <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). An AEWA Small Grants Fund supported project in Ethiopia ran from July 2012 to September 2014 (Drerup 2015). The project held four awareness-raising workshops, distributed 1,000 copies of a brochure about the species to schools, local government and the local community and produced a billboard poster to increase awareness. The project enabled protection of the species at its breeding site in the Berga wetlands: 3 ha were fenced off and members of the Site Support Group patrolled the area (these activities were to continue post-completion of the project); soil conservation measures were also implemented to reduce erosion (Drerup 2015). BirdLife South Africa have established a long-term survey being conducted annually since 2016 at core sites within Mpumalanga, South Africa. These surveys assess the ecology, demography and population dynamics, with the results having been synthesised into best practice guidelines for habitat management (BirdLife South Africa <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;In 2015 the second meeting of the AEWA White-winged Flufftail International Working Group was held in Addis Ababa, with a follow up third meeting taking place in South Africa in 2019. An Implementation Plan was developed to ensure the implementation of actions outlined in the ISSAP. The first confirmed breeding record from the southern hemisphere at Middelpunt Wetland, South Africa has resulted in the abandonment of establishing a captive facility, and the focusing of efforts on the conservation of the species’ habitat (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Secure habitat under formal protection, and promote appropriate management practices that don't deteriorate wetland habitat. Maintain and restore suitable habitat at breeding areas in Ethiopia through sustainable use under community-based conservation programmes, and it has been proposed that the conservation statue of the Berga Wetland be upgraded (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; <strong></strong>Taylor and van Perlo 1998; M. Drummond <em>in litt. </em>2016). Protect additional sites in South Africa, and a long term goal is also to declare Middelpunt Wetland a nature reserve (Barnes 2000; Evans <em>et al. </em>2015; H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. Continue surveys in Ethiopia and southern Africa to better define its range, population, seasonal movements and habitat requirements (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998; Barnes 2000). Locate new breeding sites (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004; M. Drummond <em>in litt.</em> 2005). Rehabilitate degraded wetlands (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). Conduct research to determine the extent of the species's dependency on mire habitat in South Africa (Taylor and Grundling 2003)<strong></strong>. Ensure integrity and reduce disturbance at eight sites in South Africa (De Smidt 2003).

As a result, the species is listed as Endangered.<p></p>","The Yellow-shouldered Blackbird occupies a variety of habitats, all typically along the coast where it is most common (Jaramillo and Burke 1999). Such habitats include: mud flats, salt flats, offshore red mangroves&#160;(<em>Rhizophora mangle</em>) cays, black mangrove (<em>Avicennia germinans</em>) forests, lowland dry coastal pastures, suburban areas (including buildings), coconut (<em>Cocos nucifera</em>) plantations, and coastal cliffs (Skutch 1996, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1999, Falcon <em>et al</em>. 2000, USFWS 2018).&#160;The species was once common in coastal forests, however during the early 20th century, the majority of Puerto Rico's coastal forests were replaced by sugar cane plantations, and latterly housing or livestock pasture (USFWS 2011, 2018, J.&#160;Martínez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Many birds now breed on offshore cays (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>. Whilst non-migratory, some individuals of the main island population are known to move inland to inhabit subtropical wet forest during the non-breeding season to forage (USFWS 2011). Whilst typically an arboreal insectivore, the species also forages terrestrially, consuming arachnids, small molluscs, fruits, seeds and nectar from various plant species (Skutch 1996,&#160;Raffaele <em>et al</em>. 1998, Jaramillo and Burke 1999, USFWS 2011); it has also been evidenced to consume exposed or discarded human food and livestock feed (USFWS 2018). Birds gather at communal feeding-sites, with large flocks forming during the non-breeding season (Jaramillo and Burke 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Nests are often built low in mangrove trees, or in large deciduous trees in pastures near to mangroves (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>, with several nests being built in close proximity (Jaramillo and Burke 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. On Mona Island, nests are placed in crevices or on ledges on high, vertical sea-cliffs (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>. Three clutches are usually laid per year (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>, and the breeding season is May-September.<p></p>","Historically, brood-parasitism by Shiny Cowbird <em>Molothrus bonariensis</em> has greatly reduced numbers and resulted in most birds breeding on offshore cays (Medina-Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2013, USFWS 2018). Significant reductions in cowbird parasitism have been experienced after a cowbird control program was established in 1982, however parasitism rates remain high in non-managed areas (Reitsma 1998, USFWS 2011, 2018). Additional threats are competition for nesting areas by Caribbean Martin (<em>Progne dominicensis</em>), nest-predation by the Pearly-eyed Thrasher (<em>Margarops fuscatus</em>) and elevated mortality by introduced carnivores such as Indian Mongoose (<em>Herpestes </em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">auropunctatus</span>). Nest infestation by two species of blood-feeding mites (<em>Ornithonyssus bursa</em> and <em>Androlaelaps casalis</em>) may lead to nest abandonment by adults and premature nest desertion by young birds (USFWS 1996). Lice (<em>Philopterus agelaii</em>, <em>Machaerilaemus</em> <em>sp.</em>, and <em>Myrsidea</em> <em>sp.</em>) may also affect nesting birds, particularly those in cavity (covered) nests and re-used nests from the previous breeding event (Cruz-Burgos <em>et al</em>. 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Another major ongoing threat to the species is the modification and destruction of mariquita feeding, roosting, and nesting habitat through residential and tourist development, and agriculture (USFWS 2011). Increased human-related activities in areas utilised by Yellow-shouldered Blackbird also result in increased waste in such areas which is of considerable negative influence, both throughout attracting predators such as feral cats, dogs and rats, and also by changing the diet of individuals whom eat accessible foods instead of searching and foraging in natural feeding sites (USFWS 2018, J. Martínez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Increased disturbance by recreational boaters and boat-tour operators are also of considerable detrimental influence (USFWS 2011, 2018). Boat tour operations watching wading birds at night are considered responsible for the species abandoning a major roosting area&#160;at La Parguera as the spotlights, although likely focused on other species such as egrets and night herons, disturbed the species which roosts in the same area (Medina-Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The species has a low genetic diversity, which may weaken its long-term ability to respond to environmental change (Liu 2015), particularly as there is evidenced to be no contemporary gene flow between the populations of Mona Island and the large populations of southwest Puerto Rico (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2018). In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria (2017), it is clear that an increased frequency and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes may have an adverse impact on this species as the climate continues to warm. Following Maria, it was clear that throughout Cabo Rojo, there was severe damage to available habitat, particularly in the black mangrove that surrounds artificial nests, which exposes the fledglings and adults to increased predation whilst potentially limiting available food sources. Despite this loss of habitat, particularly nesting palms, considerable habitat remained and it is thought that populations persisted successfully as a result, providing hope for survival under future intense hurricane scenarios (USFWS 2018,&#160;I. Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","In early 1998, the total population was estimated at 1,250 individuals (Jaramillo and Burke 1999), which equates to 833 mature individuals, hence it was placed in the band 250-999 mature individuals to reflect the uncertainty and fluctuations seen in population surveys. Whilst post-breeding population estimates have been carried out for individual subpopulations in the years since, inconsistencies in the timing of surveys, some subpopulations remaining largely unsurveyed and strong interannual fluctuations within subpopulations makes the generation of a new, total population estimate difficult.&#160;The latest estimates suggest approximately 400-1,000 individuals in the southwest population, ~150 individuals on Mona Island, 80-120 individuals in Salinas and at least 8-10 individuals in the eastern population (USFWS 2011, 2018, 2019, unpubl. data). This totals ~638-1,280 individuals, which equates to ~425-853 mature individuals. This estimate falls within the same range, 250-999 mature individuals, hence the population estimate is retained in this band.",Decreasing,"<em>Agelaius xanthomus</em>&#160;is endemic to&#160;<strong>Puerto Rico (to USA)</strong>&#160;and the Mona and Monito Islands. Whilst formerly widespread on Puerto Rico, it is now primarily limited to four areas: Mona and Monito islands (race&#160;<em>monensis</em>)&#160;and three populations in eastern (Ceiba), southern (Salinas), and southwestern&#160;(Cabo Rojo and Lajas)&#160;Puerto Rico (USFWS 2011). It is also found infrequently during the non-breeding season in the subtropical wet forests of the Lares and Ciales municipalities in central Puerto Rico (USFWS 2011, J. Martínez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The largest population is found in southwestern Puerto Rico. The south-west population declined by c.80% in 1975-1981 to a low of 300 individuals in 1982, but pre-reproductive season roost counts in 1985-1995 showed an average annual increase of 14% (USFWS 1996). In early 1998, the total population was estimated at 1,250 individuals (Jaramillo and Burke 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Surveys in 2007 found c.994 individuals in southwestern Puerto Rico (municipalities of Cabo Rojo and Lajas), an increase from 2004 (759 individuals). However, the population then declined by more than 50%, leaving fewer than 400 individuals by August 2012 (Miller <em>et al., </em>2016). Subsequently, the population was estimated through the post-breeding survey in 2012 at more than 650 individuals (Miller <em>et al. </em>2016). Post-breeding counts appear to exhibit strong year-on-year variation however, with counts at Cabo Rojo, southwestern Puerto Rico numbering just 424 individuals in November 2015 but 1056 individuals in September 2016 (USFWS 2018). It is thought that populations in the southwest typically range annually between 400-1,000 individuals (USWFS 2018, 2019, J.&#160;Martínez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Salinas (southeastern Puerto Rico), 113 individuals were observed during the post-breeding census of 2005, a slight increase from 2004 (97 individuals), however only 82 individuals were highlighted during the post-breeding survey of November 2012 (USFWS 2011, 2018). The Mona Island population further numbered 155 individuals in the post-breeding period of October 2012 and is thought to average 150 individuals (USFWS 2018, 2019). No systematic monitoring of the eastern population has been undertaken since 2004 however, a rapid assessment in 2018 suggested that there are at least 8-10 individuals in this population (USFWS unpubl. data). It would appear that Hurricane Maria (2017), whilst damaging significant available habitat, did not result in a population decline of this species in Cabo Rojo, the species's stronghold, as rapid counts in Pitahaya and&#160;Bahía Sucia following the hurricane illustrated typical numbers of birds, most likely due to sufficient habitat remaining intact (USWS 2018, 2019, I. Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Population counts have not yet been repeated in Mona Island or Salinas to determine the species's status in these locations following Hurricane Maria.<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>A programme installing artificial nests, monitoring reproduction and controlling populations of <em>Molothrus bonariensis</em>, rats and nest-mites has operated since 1982 (USFWS 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The Boquerón Commonwealth Forest is a stronghold for the species on the mainland (Jaramillo and Burke 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In 2006 and 2007, approximately 4,006 acres of wetland and upland habitats at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station&#160;were protected through land transfer agreement for conservation, as part of the critical habitat for the Yellow-shouldered Blackbird (USFWS 2011). The&#160;Puerto Rico Department of Natural Environmental Resources&#160;(PRDNER) undertakes successful trapping and egg removal schemes for shiny cowbirds and as a result, parasitism by the species has declined from 100% in 1982 to &lt;3% by 1996-1999 (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016, USFWS 2018); Hurricane Maria temporarily disrupted such measures however, effective controls were back in place by January 2018 (USFWS 2018). Recent evidence has highlighted that Cowbird egg removal from Yellow-shouldered Blackbird nests is the most effective control measure, considerably more so than direct cowbird trapping (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct post-hurricane assessments of all&#160;populations and habitat in Puerto Rico and Mona Island to determine their statues and improve survey methodology to obtain accurate estimates of&#160;<em>A. xanthomus</em>&#160;population size (USFWS 2018). Continue to protect and manage the species and its habitat, including the provision of artificial nests and control of Shiny Cowbirds (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Continue attempts to raise reproductive success to the targeted 0.96, particularly through increased fledging success and post-fledging survival (USFWS 2018, I. Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2020); monitor nesting activity to determine nest success and predation, and fledgling survival in order to meet such targets (USFWS 2018). Designate natural critical habitat for the species (PRDNER 2009). Monitor the success of artificial nests (USFWS 1996, 2019) and possibly redesign their structure to reduce predation of nestlings and prevent premature fledging (USFWS 2018). Integrate the conservation of this species with existing education schemes (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Further investigate possibility of translocating individuals between Mona Island and Puerto Rico to enhance genetic diversity, although initial investigations suggest this would not be an effective management action (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2018). Recovery efforts should focus on conservation of extant&#160;genetic diversity (through increases in productivity and individual population sizes) and the establishment of additional populations in historically occupied or other suitable habitat (USFWS 2019). Liu (2015) suggests that ultimately achieving effective population size for this species may be impossible and that the conservation objective should be to prevent further declines in effective population size. Thus, due to the current small size of the individual disjunct populations, attention should be given to maintaining current genetic diversity and evolutionary potential (Liu 2015, USFWS 2018, 2019). Survey the Salinas population to better understand anti-parasitic behaviour seen at the site (USFWS 2018).&#160;<p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

During April-November some individuals migrate northwards to East Africa, particularly coastal Kenya (del Hoyo <em>et al.,</em> 1994) and during the non-breeding season (May-August) some will migrate down into Southern Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001), particularly the Transvaal highveld (del Hoyo <em>et al.,</em> 1994). The species is also occasionally found in south-east Ethiopia (Brown <em>et al.,</em> 1982). The breeding season varies by locality; in southern Africa it occurs during September-March; in West Africa it is during June-August; in Kenya it is during both March-June and November –February, following the onset of the rains (Brown, <em>et al.</em>, 1982; del Hoyo <em>et al.,</em> 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). Its general behaviour is largely unknown, probably as a result of its low local densities and secretive habits (Brown <em>et al., </em>1982). However, during migration individuals become slightly more conspicuous and thus may appear more numerous (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>This reticent species occupies the interior and edges of evergreen forest and deciduous woodlands, including suburban gardens and more open savannas, up to 3000m (Brown, <em>et al.</em>, 1982; del Hoyo <em>et al.,</em> 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).&#160; During migration through East Africa it also occupies drier woodland and bush (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). <strong>Diet</strong> The species feeds mainly on insects, reptiles and small birds (Brown <em>et al.,</em> 1982). It mostly still-hunts from a perch, although it is known to hawk for flying insects and to actively search for prey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). <strong>Breeding Site</strong> Constructs small slight nests high in trees, including eucalyptus, often along a watercourse (Brown <em>et al</em>., 1982; Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001). <strong>Management Information </strong>The species utilises interior forest, but is also observed in secondary growth and open edge habitats.&#160; It is affected by the loss of forest habitat and is predated by larger raptors.&#160; There are no records of it being affected by pesticides (del Hoyo <em>et al.,</em> 1994).</p>","<p>It is affected by the loss of forest habitat and can be predated by larger raptors (del Hoyo <em>et al.,</em> 1994).

It relies heavily on soaring flight using thermals, and thus avoids large bodies of water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Birds are generally observed singly or in pairs, but will congregate at plentiful food sources, and migrate in flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Porter and Aspinall 2010). <strong>Habitat </strong>It breeds near forest edges, preferring moist woodland; most nest in lowlands but it is recorded breeding up to 2,200 m in montane areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians are all taken as prey, with different prey types predominating in different parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built in trees, usually close to the forest edge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>Where populations are struggling, productivity can be increased artificially by ensuring both chicks survive to fledging: in natural conditions one is almost always lost by siblicide, known as ""cainism"" (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","The main threats posed to this species are through habitat loss (notably abandonment or conversion of grasslands into arable land and deforestation) and hunting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Meyburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). The latter is especially prevalent on migration, with possibly thousands of birds shot annually in Syria and Lebanon (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Deforestation is degrading breeding habitats (Dravecký <em>et al</em>. 2015), and disturbance caused by forestry workers reduces breeding success (Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al.</em>. 2019). Studies on habitat use in Estonia suggest that changes in agricultural practices, particularly a reduction in grassland, and an increasing sown area of oilseed rape and maize may degrade foraging habitat around breeding areas (Vali <em>et al. </em>2017). Abandonment of breeding territories has been linked to depopulation of rural areas leading to a decline in stock grazing, resulting in afforestation of grassland and a decline in rodent prey (Demerdzhiev <em>et al. </em>2019)<em>.</em>&#160;It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012). Electrocution may pose an additional threat on migration and at wintering grounds, but this has not been well studied (Demerdzhiev &amp; Ratarova-Georgieva 2017).&#160;The Chernobyl nuclear accident may have affected the species (Alon 2000 in Global Raptor Information Network 2015). Construction of the new Istanbul airport could have an impact on the species (S. Oppel <em>in litt</em>. 2014).

There are some areas where there may be local stability, and there is a paucity of information available regarding trends from the Asian portion of the species's range. Taking this information into account, overall declines are tentatively suspected to be rapid, and as such the species is listed as Vulnerable. Further information could show that the species warrants listing under a higher threat level.","<p><strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is resident across the Afrotropical, Indomalayan and fringing Palearctic regions (34°N to 31°S) but occurs in discrete populations. It is common across its range, and generally sedentary, although individuals are nomadic and will occasionally wander long distances. In West Africa individuals will make short distance seasonal movements south into the damper woodlands during October – November and return in April (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Habitat </strong>The species occupies dry open habitats from sea level to 3000m, and will occupy both woodland and wooded savannah. In India it can be found near cultivated areas, settlements and slaughterhouses (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Diet </strong>The species has a wide prey base, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, and occasionally fish and amphibians. It will also regularly consume carrion and pirate other raptors’ prey (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Breeding Site</strong> Nesting occurs on a large stick platform that may also incorporate animal bones, and is located on top of tall isolated trees or occasionally on top of a pylon. The breeding season in Africa spans March to August in the north, October to June in the West, April to January in central and southern areas, and year-round (but mainly May-November) in Kenya. In India the season spans November to August (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).</p>","The species has declined in the farmed areas of eastern and southern Africa, apparently as a result of consuming poisoned carcasses. Widespread poisoning of feral dogs in Ethiopia could then prove to be a major problem, in addition to private poisoning (E. Buechley <em>in litt. </em>2018). In western and north-east Africa declines have been reported but the causes are not known. In general the species’s opportunistic behaviour suggests it is resistant to the usual threats (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) although long term changes in rainfall patterns could affect the breeding success of the species in future (Wichmann <em>et al</em>. 2004). In South Africa it has been known to drown in farmland reservoirs (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1999) and birds have been killed through collisions with power lines (Global Raptor Information Network 2015, E. Buechley <em>in litt. </em>2018). Direct persecution and collisions with road vehicles when scavenging have also been identified as threats (Global Raptor Information Network 2015, M. Virani <em>in litt. </em>2018). Accidental poisoning has also been reported (Brown 1991) and while the impact of NSAIDs on this species is not clear, a congener, the Steppe Eagle (<em>Aquila nipalensis</em>), has recently been shown to be affected by diclofenac (Sharma&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","<p>African Raptor DataBank data suggests that given available habitat, of varying suitability, there could be a population size of 73,860 pairs in Africa.

Simmons (2015) additionally proposes the production of further education and awareness materials to try to reduce poisoning incidents, as well as training for law enforcers.

This negative trend is a result of a range of anthropogenic factors including electrocution on power lines, unsustainable capture for the falconry trade, as well as habitat  degradation and the impacts of agrochemicals, and the rate of decline appears to be particularly severe in the species's central Asian breeding grounds. This classification is highly uncertain and may be revised when new information becomes available. Surveys are urgently needed to produce more robust and less uncertain population estimates, in particular for China, Russia and Mongolia. Further research to monitor key populations and to clarify the extent of   anthropogenic threats and their effect on population trends is vital.<p></p>","It is physically adapted to hunting close to the ground in open terrain, combining rapid acceleration with high manoeuvrability, thus specialising on mid-sized diurnal terrestrial rodents (especially ground squirrels&#160;<em>Spermophilus</em>) of open grassy landscapes such as desert edge, semi-desert, steppes, agricultural and arid montane areas. In some areas, particularly near water and even in urban environments (A. Kovács <em>in litt. </em>2016), it switches to birds as key prey, and has recently substituted domestic pigeons for rodents in parts of Europe (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. It uses copses or cliffs for nest sites (sometimes even the ground), occupying the old nests of other birds (Baumgart 1991, <strong></strong>Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. Clutch size varies from three to five (exceptionally two to six), with means from 3.2-3.9 in different circumstances (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998, A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Breeding success varies with year (especially in areas where rodents cycle) (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The species usually occurs singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are sedentary, part-migratory or fully migratory, largely depending on the extent to which food supply in breeding areas disappears in winter (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Migrant birds winter in East Africa, southern Europe and southern Asia, with 25-50% of the global population wintering on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2015b), and generally leave their breeding grounds in September and October, returning between February and May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).<br/><p></p>","In Europe, this species has suffered mainly from&#160;electrocution on power lines and decreased prey availability due to&#160;the loss and degradation of steppes and dry grasslands through agricultural intensification, plantation establishment and declines in sheep pastoralism, while offtake for falconry has also been a serious problem, which has caused local extinctions in the past (Baumgart 1991, 1994, Kovács <em>et al. </em>2014,&#160;K. Ruskov <em>in litt. </em>2007, A. Kovács <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. In eastern Hungary, landscape reversion following the abandonment of agriculture could have a negative influence, as most prey species require short swards that are maintained by agricultural practices (S. Nagy <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Brochet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2019) estimated that 8% of the European population is illegally killed/ taken in Northern and Central Europe and the Caucasus each year. Deliberate shooting/ poisoning by pigeon keepers and unintentional or negligent poisoning through agriculture or hunting activities (e.g. rodenticides, poisoned baits, lead) poses a further threat.&#160;<br/><br/>Elsewhere, declines are mainly attributable to offtake for falconry (especially trapping of breeding birds), habitat change resulting in prey loss in Kazakhstan (Watson &amp; Clarke 2000) and electrocution on power lines (e.g. Dixon <em>et al. </em>2013, 2017),&#160;although persecution, pesticide use leading to secondary poisoning (notably in Mongolia in 2003) and agrochemical deployment play a lesser part (Baumgart 1991; Remple 1994; Barton 2000; Riddle 1994; Eastham <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 2000;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>Fox 2002;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span><strong></strong><strong></strong>Haines 2002;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>ERWDA 2003; Kovács&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The number trapped annually for Middle East falconers has been estimated at 4,000 in Saudi Arabia, 1,000 in Qatar and 500-1,000 in each of Bahrain, Kuwait and U.A.E., which, allowing for a 5% mortality prior to receipt, indicates an annual consumption of 6,825-8,400 birds (Fox 2002, ERWDA 2003)<strong></strong>. Of these, the great majority (77%) were believed to be juvenile females, followed by 19% adult females, 3% juvenile males and 1% adult males, potentially creating a major bias in the wild population (Fox 2002, ERWDA 2003)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Other studies, however, give a far lower estimate for numbers legally trapped in Saudi Arabia, e.g. at an average of 22 birds per year in the period 2002-2009 (M. Shobrak <em>in litt. </em>2010); 19.7 individuals per year for period 1989-2013 to 575 individuals over period 1996-2013 (see Shobrak 2015). The Qinghai Wildlife Management Bureau estimate that at least 1,200 Saker Falcons per year are illegally trapped in Qinghai province, China (Zhang <em>et al. </em>2008). Illegal trapping has also been recorded in Jordan (Eid &amp; Handal 2018). Brochet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2019) estimated that 8% of the European population is illegally killed/ taken in Northern and Central Europe and the Caucasus each year. Electrocution is another significant cause of mortality - 1,721 electrocuted Saker Falcons were found during surveys in Mongolia during 2013-2015 and 2018, most of which were juveniles (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2020). It has been suggested that hybridisation with escaped or released hybrid falcons could influence the genetic integrity of wild populations (Nittinger <em>et al.</em> 2006), but risk is considered to be low (Dixon 2012). On the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau in China, policies to control rodents and herding practices, along with the development of hydroelectric dams and human settlements with electricity power infrastructure, have the potential to impact the population (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2016).

It is listed on CMS Appendix I and II (as of November 2011, and excluding the Mongolian population) and CITES Appendix II, and in 2002 CITES imposed a trade ban on UAE, strongly affecting the unregulated market there (Fox 2002)<strong></strong>. It occurs in a number of protected areas across its range. Intensive wardening and management has produced a steadily rising population in Hungary (Baumgart 1994). Controls of illegal trade were implemented in various countries in western range in 1990s (Baumgart 1994)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding has developed strongly in some countries, including UAE, as a means of substituting farmed for wild-caught birds (Riddle and Remple 1994, Dixon, 2012, N. Fox <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2002). Clinics have also been set up to improve the longevity and availability of wild-caught birds in various Gulf states (Riddle and Remple 1994, Bailey <em>et al. </em>2001<strong></strong>). New research programmes in many parts of the range have begun to establish baseline data on distribution, population, ecology and threats. For instance, satellite tracking of individuals is taking place, with the aim of revealing movements and site use (e.g. Bagyura&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012,&#160;Gamauf and Dosedel 2012, Prommer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;Artificial nests have been erected in some areas, and in particular in Mongolia, &gt;5,000 artificial nests were erected with funding from the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi,  providing nesting sites for 766 pairs by 2014 (Bagyura <em>et al. </em>2012; Rahman <em>et al. </em>2014; Dixon 2015; Dixon 2011); and this programme in Mongolia led to the production of &gt;10,000 fledglings since 2011 (A. Dixon <em>in litt. </em>2021). Over 10,000 artificial nests and perches have been erected by Chinese authorities on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as part of measures to control Plateau Pikas. chicks in 2013 (Middle East Falcon Research Group 2013). As a product of the resolution resulting from CMS COP10 in November 2011, a Saker Falcon Task Force was established and met for the first time in March 2012 in Abu Dhabi (UAE). A Global Action Plan for the Saker Falcon was produced in 2014 (Kovács&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Conservation efforts in Europe have resulted in positive population trends (A. Dixon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in <em>litt</em></span><em>. </em>2012). A captive-breeding and release programme is being implemented in Bulgaria to restore the extirpated breeding population (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2019a). 80 Saker Falcons were released during the period 2015-2020, and the first successful breeding in the wild was confirmed in 2018 (Lazarova <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;Trials of mitigation techniques to reduce electrocution rates have been implemented at power lines in Mongolia (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2018, 2019b), with further proposals to implement retrofitting at a national scale in the country. CMS Raptors MoU, IUCN, BirdLife International and International Association for Falconry and Conservation of Birds of Prey launched an information portal and online survey in 2015, which was updated to a 10-language network with regional satellites in 2019, and has had 16,000 visitors (www.sakernet.org).&#160;<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Implement the Saker Global Action Plan through strong stakeholder collaboration within the Saker Falcon Adaptive Management Framework (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Maintain or implement programmes of population and habitat management throughout the range, and ensure that legislation is appropriate and effective to prevent overharvest (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Maintain or improve systems of wardening and customs control (including DNA sampling to check provenance of traded birds). Enforce CITES regulations, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. Improve exportation standards including meeting IATA transportation specifications. Improve import regulations, staff capacity and practices (quarantine facilities). Monitor markets to quantify falcon trade. Develop existing microchipping schemes to help monitor and regulate trade and quantify its effects. Increase awareness of health and conservation issues among falconers. Continue key biological research (Baumgart 1991, 1994), such as&#160;studying, monitoring and censusing the species throughout its range.&#160;This may also include further studying of migration routes, changes in metapopulations, as well as investigating the degree of impact anthropogenic activities (other than trapping for trade) have on this species (Kovács&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Continue to establish controlled artificial nest systems where safe nest sites are limited to increase breeding population and breeding success (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;Falcon health care and controlled releases/reintroduction may reduce the pressure on wild Saker Falcon populations and thereby play an important role in the recovery of the species (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), and a pilot release project has been completed in Bulgaria to restore an extirpated population (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2019a). Maintain ecologically and socially sustainable grazing systems to ensure long-term survival of key prey species. Bring greater protection (against conversion, degradation and pollution) to key breeding environments (Baumgart 1991, Bailey <em>et al. </em>2001, Fox 2002, <strong></strong>ERWDA 2003)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Ensure that new and fully reconstructed electric lines are safe for birds by design, and modify existing high-risk poles to be safe for birds with the most cost-effective mitigation measures (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;Raise the awareness of stakeholders about the risks of bird - power line interactions, bird friendly designs, their quality applications and priorities for mitigation (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;Review and improve the legal protection of the Saker Falcon where it is necessary to protect it from unintentional or deliberate killing and disturbance where it is considered detrimental (A.

Overall it is suspected to have undergone a very rapid decline of 63-89% over three generations owing to intentional and unintentional poisoning, habitat loss and conversion to agro-pastoral systems, declines in wild ungulate populations, hunting for trade and collisions. These declines are likely to continue into the future. For this reason it is listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","<em>Gyps africanus </em>is primarily a lowland species of open wooded savanna, particularly areas of <em>Acacia</em>. It requires tall trees for nesting, but has also been recorded nesting on electricity pylons in South Africa (de Swardt 2013). It is a gregarious species congregating at carcasses, in thermals and at roost sites. It nests in loose colonies. <p></p>","The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for trade, persecution and poisoning (see Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160; <br/><br/>In East Africa, the primary issue is poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide carbofuran), which occurs primarily   outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>species and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. rueppellii </span>puts them at significant risk, as this means they inevitably spend  considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010,   Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Kendall and  Virani 2012). Hunting with lead ammunition may also be incidentally contributing to species mortality (Naidoo <em>et al. </em>2017, Garbett <em>et al. </em>2018). Evidence from wing-tagging and telemetry  studies suggests that  annual mortality, primarily from incidental  poisoning, can be as high as  25% for the species&#160;(Kendall and Virani 2012). Cases across Africa suggest that the species may be subject to deliberate and accidental poisoning, respectively (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada<em> et al. </em>2016b): in the former case for belief-based use and to prevent birds from drawing attention to poaching activities. Mass poisoning events include at least 144 White-backed Vultures killed after feeding on an elephant carcass in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom <em>et al</em>. 2013); 76 died after feeding on 6 poisoned lion carcasses near Ruaha National Park, Tanzania in March 2018 (SSC<em>&#160;</em>2018); 468 died after feeding on 3 elephant carcasses in Botswana in June 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Modelling has shown that even one poisoned elephant carcass can have a dramatic impact on a population (Murn and Botha 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007), and the decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P. Hall&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2011). The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa, with an estimated 924-1,386 individuals traded over a six year period in West Africa, probably representing a significant proportion of the species's regional population (Buij&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). In South Africa, White-backed Vulture is one of the preferred vulture species in trade, according to a survey of traditional healers and traders (McKean&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). As a result of this and environmental pressures, it is predicted that the population in Zululand could become locally extinct in 26 years, unless harvest rates have been underestimated, in which case local extinction could be 10-11 years away (McKean and Botha 2007)<strong></strong>.&#160; There is also evidence that it is captured for international trade; for example in 2005, 13 individuals of this species being kept illegally in Italy were reportedly confiscated (F. Genero<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to&#160;<em>Gyps&#160;</em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. It was also reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2007)<strong></strong>&#160;and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. However, given that livestock carrion is not generally left out for scavenger consumption, this is likely to have less of an impact than it has in south-east Asia (C. Kendall&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/>Electrocution on powerlines is also a problem in parts of its range, and it is vulnerable to nest harvesting or disturbance by humans (Bamford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009); perhaps more so than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. rueppellii</span>, as it breeds in trees rather than on inaccessible cliffs (C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Additionally, the wild ungulate populations on which this species relies have declined precipitously throughout West and East Africa, even in protected areas (Western&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009, Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and, despite increased livestock numbers, improved animal husbandry and carcass disposal has reduced the number of livestock carcasses available (Mundy <em>et al. </em>1992). There is also a minor threat from road traffic, with individuals occasionally killed by vehicles (BirdLife Botswana 2008). Reported threats in the Athi-Kaputiei area in Kenya (an important breeding site for the species) include wind energy development, illegal logging of large trees (although Kendall <em>et al. </em>[2017] concluded that tree availability was not a limiting factor for vultures breeding in Masai Mara National Reserve), and natural gas exploration (Shema 2019).&#160;<p></p>","The species's global population was estimated at 270,000 individuals in 1992 (Mundy <em>et al. </em>1992), but it may now be more than an order of magnitude lower than this due to rapid population declines in recent years (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). The median estimate of the rate of decline, 4.1% annually (2.5-5.4%) (Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016a), is equivalent to a three generation reduction of 81% (63-89%).",Decreasing,"This species is the most widespread and common vulture in Africa, although it is now undergoing rapid declines. It occurs from <strong>Senegal, Gambia</strong> and <strong>Mali</strong> in the west, throughout the Sahel region to <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and <strong>Somalia</strong> in the east, through East Africa into <strong>Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia</strong> and <strong>South Africa</strong> in the south. Its global population has been estimated at 270,000 individuals. Consistent with other vulture species, it has declined by over 90% in West Africa (<strong></strong>J. M.

An ongoing study near Kimberley, South Africa, shows the number of breeding pairs has increased by 72% in 22 years (from 50 to 86 breeding pairs) (A. Anthony <em>in litt</em>. 2015). However McKean <em>et al</em>.

The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The species occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range, and ongoing monitoring efforts are underway in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Namibia, Ethiopia, and Botswana with plans to extend these to Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (BirdLife Botswana 2008, C. Kendall&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/>In 2007, a survey began to establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in Tanzania (Woodford <em>et al. </em>2008)<strong></strong>, and in 2008 an awareness-raising campaign at a conference of the World Organisation for Animal Health in Senegal led to a resolution being adopted unanimously by more than 160 delegates to ""request members to consider their national situation with the aim to seek measures to find solutions to the problems caused by the administration of diclofenac in livestock"" (C. Bowden&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2008, Woodford&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2008). A press release was also circulated in July 2007 to raise awareness of the impacts of hunting for medicinal and cultural reasons in southern Africa (McKean and Botha 2007), while&#160;BirdLife Botswana have launched a campaign to tackle illegal poisoning (Anon. 2013). At the 2014 Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species, a set of guidelines to address poisoning was formally adopted (Ogada <em>et al</em>. 2016a). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are  currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning  teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to respond  to a neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Since 2015, more than 1,500 rangers, veterinarians, police and other law enforcement and conservation staff have been trained in poisoning response and intervention in 10 countries, and initial results suggest that this can reduce vulture mortality by up to 30% (SSC<em>&#160;</em>2018).<br/><br/>The species is listed as nationally Critically Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan<em> </em>2015), and Endangered in Uganda and Namibia (Brown and Simmons 2015, WCS 2016).<br/><strong></strong><br/><br/><strong>Conservation&#160;</strong><strong>and Research&#160;</strong><strong>Actions Proposed<br/></strong>As part of the Multi-species Action Plan for African-Eurasian Vultures, over 120 key actions were put forward (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). Of these, 117 are considered relevant to African species. Full details for these can be found in Table 6 of Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017), but those actions considered 'Essential' by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) are presented here.<br/><br/>The two objectives with the most essential actions are to address knowledge gaps, and to reduce vulture unintentional mortality caused by the hunting of vertebrates. Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) say that the essential actions when trying to address knowledge gaps are to monitor the population sizes, distributions and trends; conduct a study to put a value on the ecosystem services and eco-tourism benefits vultures provide; and develop criteria for Vulture Safe Zones and implement these throughout the range states of the MsAP. To address the objective to reduce unintentional vulture mortality, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) suggest an overall analysis of poisoning's role in human-wildlife conflict, focusing on vultures; further awareness campaigns; training of staff to rapidly respond to poisoning incidents; and review and enforce penalties for wildlife poisoning, and if necessary introduce new penalties.<br/><br/>Further objectives also look into combating vulture mortality due to a range of factors. To combat the threat from NSAIDs, the essential actions proposed by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) are to prohibit the use of vulture-toxic NSAIDs in livestock and substitute them for vulture-friendly alternatives; and develop and implement a formal process to identify whether veterinary NSAIDs are toxic prior to them going on the market. For the threat from lead poisoning, the essential action proposed by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) is to implement CMS Resolution 11.15 as well as encouraging the voluntary uptake of lead ammunition bans in countries not part of CMS. In order to combat the threats from illegal trade and sentinel poisoning awareness and engagement programmes with stakeholders and training of rapid response units, respectively, have been proposed as essential actions (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017; Murn and Botha 2018). There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). The threats from infrastructure (collisions and electrocution) have similar essential actions, which are to conduct sensitivity mapping exercises to identify key regions; and promoting CMS guidelines to reduce mortality due to these threats (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>Finally, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) recommend as an essential action the establishment of a framework to effectively implement the MsAP, including both global and regional coordination units, which may be key to implementing not only these other essential actions, but as many of the other high and medium priority actions laid out in the action plan.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It feeds on carrion, both putrid and fresh. While feeding considerable aggregations can form, and regular communal roost sites are used. It is social and usually found in conspecific flocks. It breeds in colonies in tall trees (e.g. in Himanchal Pradesh it is restricted to pine forest/plantations [Thakur 2015, M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016]), often near human habitation. Movements are poorly known, although satellite-tagged birds have shown that they will forage over a vast range. The degree of connectivity of apparently separate populations is not known. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, as they were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in South Asia. <p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported&#160;(Prakash <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2007, Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume. Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause&#160;renal failure resulting in visceral gout in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a<strong></strong>, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Green <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;<strong></strong>Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014). Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in <em>Gyps</em> vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (<strong></strong>Green <em>et al</em>. 2004);&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality and diclofenac being banned in several range states, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008)<strong></strong>, potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam,&#160;an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan <em>et al. </em>2006a, Swarup <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160;Additionally, large vials of diclofenac continue to be manufactured for human use, which are then distributed, sold and used for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;A second veterinary drug in use in India and particularly in Bangladesh, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo <em>et al.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Nambirajan <em>et al. in prep.&#160;</em>2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla <em>et al. </em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). One study recorded that the sex of fledglings, the sex of dead adults and the sex of adults with visceral gout were all male-biased which may lead to problems in the future (Arshad&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>Other likely contributory factors in South Asia are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers) and poison and pesticide use, but these are probably of more minor significance (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;&#160;In Bangladesh, 61% of cattle owners surveyed said that they now buried dead cattle or used them as food in shrimp farms, which could lead to a reduction in food supply for vultures (Khan 2013). Forest fires may also be a threat in some areas, for instance in the Himalayas, though this may need further study (M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016). Deforestation, electrocution and collision with energy infrastructure may pose additional threats in some parts of the range (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of deceased livestock reducing food availability (Clements <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong>. In Cambodia, vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides to kill stray dogs and for hunting wildlife (Loveridge <em>et al. </em>2019; Clements <em>et al. </em>2013; S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Loveridge <em>et al </em>(2019) recorded 15 vulture poisoning events in Cambodia during 2005-2016, resulting in the known deaths of 32 White-rumped Vultures. The same study also recorded the first confirmed vulture mortality from carbofuran in Cambodia. Additional threats identified in Myanmar include direct persecution of the species through nest destruction, hunting and poisoning and indirectly through a loss of food supply (Hla <em>et al</em>. 2011).<p></p>","Formerly described as possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world, with a global population almost certainly numbering several million individuals, this species suffered dramatic population declines during the 1990s across its range. There are now an estimated c.6,000 individuals in India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2019), &lt;2,000 individuals in Nepal (DNPWC 2015), c.100 individuals in Cambodia (Sum and Loveridge 2016), c.260 individuals in Bangladesh (MoEF 2016) and 250-350 individuals in Bhutan and Pakistan (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The total population is therefore estimated to be c. 6,000-9,000 individuals, equating to 4,000-6,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps bengalensis</em> occurs in <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong>, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong> and southern<strong> Viet Nam, </strong>and may be extinct in<strong> </strong>southern<strong> </strong>China and Malaysia (BirdLife International 2001). It has been recorded from south-east Afghanistan and Iran where its status is currently unknown. As recently as 1985 the species was described as ""possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world"" (Houston 1985)<strong></strong>. However, it disappeared from most of South-East Asia in the early 20th century and the only viable populations in the region are found in Myanmar and Cambodia, mainly in the north (both probably in the low hundreds of individuals) (Hla 2003, Anon 2003, 2005, Eames 2007a,b, Hance 2009)<strong></strong>. Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in this part of its range is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005),&#160;as well as the impact of poisoning events as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practises (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Since the mid-1990s, it has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 99%) across the Indian Subcontinent (the majority of its historic range), first noticed&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">by villagers in northern India in 1996-97 (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016), with further early evidence from&#160;Keoladeo National Park, India, and then throughout India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003, 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, Pakistan (Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006),&#160;Nepal (Baral <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012) and Bangladesh (Khan 2013)<strong></strong>, to the point that the species is highly threatened with extinction. Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,<strong></strong> Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004<strong></strong><em></em>)<strong></strong>. This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, 2004b; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Declines in India between 2000 and 2007 averaged 43.9% per year (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>, and ranged between 11%-61% in Punjab province, Pakistan over the same period (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, while surveys of 23 known colonies in Punjab province in 2006 found a total of only 37 breeding pairs (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In the lowland districts of Nepal the species declined at 14% a year between 2002 and 2011 (Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). In Bangladesh, the species declined by 60% between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 (Khan 2013), and the population trend in the country is still a decline (IUCN-Bangladesh 2016).&#160;The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan banned veterinary diclofenac in 2006 and the Government of Bangladesh followed suit in 2010 (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). Since then, the rate of decline appears to have slowed, and may even have reversed in India and Nepal (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012). Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population (minimum 201 individuals in 2010; 183 individuals in 2011 [Clements <em>et al. </em>2013])<strong></strong>. Census results from Cambodia suggest the population there may have been increasing since 2004, or is at least stable (Eames 2007b, Clements <em>et al. </em>2013, S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), while there may be some local increases in India (D. L. Bohra <em>in litt. </em>2016). A local increase has also been noted in Pakistan, though this may be more a result of immigration (Murn <em>et al. </em>2014). Surveys of vulture restaurants in Myanmar in 2006 and 2007 estimated a minimum of 62 White-rumped Vultures were present (Hla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices I &amp; II, Raptors MOU Category 3. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the veterinary use of diclofenac, and Bangladesh followed suit in 2010. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008)<strong></strong>. The availability of diclofenac in veterinary drug stores in Bangladesh decreased from 100% in 2008-2009 to 53% in 2011-2012 (Khan 2013). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on <em>Gyps</em> vultures with no ill-effects (Swan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Swarup<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, such as ketoprofen (banned in&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Coimbatore, Erode and Nilgiris<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Districts [Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2016])&#160;(Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are currently multiple Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014, SAVE 2015). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as supporting wild birds (R. Cuthbert <em>in litt. </em>2016). They can also bring in vulture-related income for locals, through ecotourism (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are increasingly used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range, particularly Cambodia and Nepal, to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). The exchange of diclofenac with meloxicam near breeding colonies is taking place in Nepal in combination with diversionary feeding with diclofenac-free carcasses (Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce but not eliminate vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, simultaneously censusing nesting colonies, vulture deaths and looking for diclofenac use (Eames 2007a).&#160;Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., and to aid the development of suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that vultures provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres, each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts are on-going and met with success when two chicks hatched in early 2007 at a breeding centre in Pinjore, Haryana (V. Prakash <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Three more birds hatched in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive flocks that will ensure the full geographical spread of the species is represented in captive breeding efforts (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. By April 2008, there were 88 in captivity at three breeding centres in India, as well as 11 at a centre established by WWF-Pakistan and 14 in captivity in Nepal (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. During 2009, these numbers increased to 120 in India, 43 in Nepal and 14 in Pakistan (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. In late 2009, trials of artificial incubation methods were due to start soon (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. By November 2015, the total number held in breeding centres affiliated to SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) stood at 218 birds at 3 centres in India, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015), of which 20 juveniles had successfully fledged (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012); and as of 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles of all three resident&#160;<em>Gyps </em>species&#160;combined (V. Prakash <em>pers. comm. per. </em>C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Six captive-reared birds were released in Nepal in 2017, followed by the first 8 captive-bred individuals and a further 4 captive-reared birds in September 2018 (SAVE 2018). Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Wildlife Trust of India and the Assam Forest Department (Wildlife Trust of India 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). An updated action plan for vulture conservation in India was written in 2020 (MoEFCC 2020). Cambodia and Nepal have updated their 10-year (2016-2025)&#160;(Sum and Loveridge 2016)&#160;and 6-year (2014-2019) action plans (DNPWC 2015), and in 2016 an action plan was produced for Bangladesh. In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;<em>A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered&#160;</em>Gyps&#160;<em>vultures&#160;</em>that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to measure the frequency of diclofenac and ketoprofen-treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and support species management or restoration, as needed. Strengthen public awareness and public support programmes, including providing veterinary camps and livestock management training (SAVE 2014). Monitor remaining populations, in particular continue activities in Cambodia and Myanmar. Monitor the sale of veterinary drugs, and contamination of ungulate carcasses/dead vultures (SAVE 2014). Provide supplementary food sources, with appropriately-sized carcasses, where necessary for food-limited populations (see Hille <em>et al. </em>2016). Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres with the aim of holding at least 150 pairs of each species in captivity (<strong></strong>Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2008, Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008). Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012). Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac, and improve its availability (SAVE 2015). Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones.&#160;Four additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide, flunixin and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2016), and support bans for these vulture-toxic drugs. Attempt to fully implement a restriction in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2011, SAVE 2014). Promote Vulture Safe Zones, with expansion to include trans-boundary efforts as well as the opportunity for vulture-based ecotourism (SAVE 2014, 2015).

The distribution of this species and existing efforts to reduce diclofenac use may limit the impacts.","This species inhabits mountainous areas, mostly at 1,200-5,500 m (X. Lu <em>in litt</em>. 2016), but has been recorded up to 6,000 m (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In winter it moves lower down, with juveniles wandering into the plains. It feeds on carrion (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1994) and regularly visits carcass dumps in South and South-East Asia (Praveen J. <em>in litt</em>. 2012, T. H. Galligan <em>in litt</em>. 2016, D. L. Yong <em>in litt</em>. 2016).","The most serious potential threat to this species is thought to be mortality caused through ingestion of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) widely used in livestock, particularly in South Asia. Diclofenac has caused drastic declines in three other <em>Gyps</em> species in South Asia since the early 1990s, owing to kidney failure following ingestion, with clinical signs of extensive visceral gout and renal failure, and the drug also appears to be fatal in <em>G. himalayensis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2010). Veterinary use of diclofenac is less common within the breeding range of <em>G. himalayensis </em>so adults are unlikely to be exposed, but juveniles may be when they migrate to lowland areas of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan (Das <em>et al. </em>2010; Bothat <em>et al. </em>2017). The decline noted in the Upper Mustang region of Nepal in 2002-2005 was thought highly likely to be caused by diclofenac poisoning <span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says"">(Acharya <em>et al</em>. 2009).

Inskipp and H. S. Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2013, K. Paudel and T. Galligan <em>in litt</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>Other potential threats include habitat degradation and a shortage of suitable nesting sites (H. Kala <em>in litt</em>. 2013), as well as the ingestion of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides (Acharya <em>et al</em>. 2009). On the Qinghai-Tibet plateau the main threats appear to be chemical control for pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and the removal of livestock carcasses (X. Lu <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Thailand lack of natural food sources has been the sole reason for birds (20 juveniles) being admitted to the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit (C. Kasorndorkbua&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). In Pakistan, increased shrub cover due to a decline in winter grass cutting, promotion of stall feeding of livestock and decreasing nomadic pastoralism may be reducing the visibility of carcasses from the air, while reduced livestock numbers may be further limiting food availability (Siddique and Khan 2016).

This species feeds almost entirely on carrion, and often associates with White-rumped Vulture <em>G. bengalensis</em> when scavenging at carcass dumps and slaughterhouses. It nests almost exclusively in colonies on cliffs and ruins, although in one area, where cliffs are absent, it has been reported nesting in trees. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, and were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India, which in turn reduces the amount of food available for potentially problematic species, such as feral dogs (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2012b).<p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Pakistan and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported (Prakash&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, 2007, Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality, with renal failure resulting in visceral gout found in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that have been treated with the drugs prior to death and left for scavengers to consume (as is tradition in Hindu cultures). Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs that then cause renal failure and death. Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in the species just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues <strong></strong>(Green <em>et al</em>. 2004),&#160;and sampling livestock carcasses in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations<strong> </strong>(Paudel 2008), potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam, an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006a, Swarup&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Recent bans of diclofenac in the region still have not eradicated its use in veterinary treatments, as it is still found in the carcasses of livestock and vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014, 2015). This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015). A second veterinary drug in use in India, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Nambirajan&#160;<em>et al. in prep.&#160;</em>2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Other possible contributory factors are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers), unintentional poisoning from consumption of poisoned baits intended for feral dogs or wild carnivores, electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure, disturbance from rock climbers at cliff nesting sites (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), drought (Hall <em>et al. </em>2012) and mining activity (Chhangani 2004).","Prakash <em>et al. </em>(2019) estimated the population to be c.12,000 individuals based on road transects carried out in 2015. This roughly equates to 8,000 mature individuals. It is placed in the band 5,000-15,000 mature individuals.&#160;<p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps indicus</em> breeds in south-east <strong>Pakistan</strong> and peninsular <strong>India</strong> south of the Gangetic plain, north to Delhi, east through Madhya Pradesh, south to the Nilgiris, and occasionally further south (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species was first recorded in Nepal in 2011 (Subedi and DeCandido 2013). It was common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 97%) throughout its range. This was first noticed in Keoladeo National Park, India <strong></strong>(Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003), where counts of feeding birds fell from 816 birds in 1985-1986 to just 25 in 1998-1999. Only tiny populations in the Ramanagaram Hills of Karnataka and Nilgiri Forest Division in Tamil Nadu are known to remain in inland southern India, and it is rare elsewhere within its former range (Prakash <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2015, 2016). A&#160;new breeding colony appears to have developed near the India-Pakistan border in the Bikaner District, India (Chaudhry&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).<p></p>",Small numbers are kept in captivity for display.,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices 1 &amp; 2, Raptors MOU Category 1. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. In 2006 the Indian government passed a bill banning the manufacture and importation of diclofenac as a veterinary drug, and in 2008 further legislation was passed banning the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of veterinary diclofenac.&#160;Similar laws are now in place in Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India in 2008 warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use'<strong> </strong>(BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008)<strong></strong>. However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on&#160;<em>Gyps</em>&#160;vultures with no ill-effects (Swan&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Swarup<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al.</span>&#160;2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres each capable of holding 25 pairs<strong> </strong>(Bombay Natural History Society 2004) - ultimately at least 150 pairs of the three species should be held in captivity to ensure sufficient birds are available to re-establish wild colonies in the future <strong></strong>(<strong></strong>Lindsay 2008). Captive breeding efforts are ongoing - by 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles per year of all three resident&#160;<em>Gyps&#160;</em>vultures combined (V. Prakash&#160;<em>pers. comm.;</em>&#160;Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), and there are currently over 600 individuals in captivity at three captive breeding centres in India<strong> </strong>(SAVE 2021)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focused on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs (Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Conservation activities include: meeting key groups (e.g. pharmacists, veterinarians and livestock owners); engaging government officials (e.g. drug control, livestock services and forest departments) at tehsil, district and state levels; engaging with the public (e.g. festival programmes, media coverage and signage); diclofenac-free district declaration; community-run formal or informal Vulture Safe Feeding Sites (i.e., vulture [Jatayu] restaurants); vulture-related income generation for villages at nesting or feeding sites; diclofenac-meloxicam exchanges; husbandry and veterinary training camps; and national and international ecotourism to feeding sites and conservation breeding sites (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;There are currently 12 provisional Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce (but not eliminate) vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps</em><em> </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008). Satellite tagging has been employed on Asian <em>Gyps </em>vultures&#160;to improve understanding of their movements and range use so as to aid the development of conservation strategies for the genus (Ellis 2004).<br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). An updated 5-year (2020-2025) action plan has been produced for vulture conservation in India (MoEFCC 2020), and a 4-year (2015-2019) action plan was was written for Nepal but has not been updated (DNPWC 2015).&#160;In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;<em>A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered&#160;</em>Gyps&#160;<em>vultures&#160;</em>that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Identify the location and number of remaining individuals. Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and attempt to implement a ban on other vulture-toxic NSAIDs.&#160;Support species management or restoration, as needed. Monitor remaining populations. Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres. Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac. Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones. Three drugs, aceclofenac, ketoprofen and nimesulide, are thought to be toxic to vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2015), and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013). Fully implement restrictions in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011). Attempt to estimate the potential value, in terms of ecosystem services, provided by wild vultures. Protect nesting areas. Maintain and promote Vulture Safe Zones, including trans-boundary efforts. Within VSZs, promote livestock management training and provide free veterinary camps.These and multiple other Conservation Actions were proposed as part of SAVE (2014) and SAVE (2015) for all Asian vultures. A comprehensive list of conservation actions proposed can be found in Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017).&#160;<p></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Overall it  is suspected to have undergone a very rapid decline owing to habitat  loss and conversion to agro-pastoral systems, declines in wild ungulate  populations, hunting for trade, persecution, electrocution and collision with powerlines and poisoning.<br/><p></p>","It frequents open areas of <em>Acacia</em> woodland, grassland and montane regions, and it is gregarious, congregating at carrion, soaring together in flocks and breeding mainly in colonies on cliff faces and escarpments at a broad range of elevations. In Kenya, the number of nests at a colony may be inversely related to rainfall in the previous year, and timing of nesting varies from year to year (Virani <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;It locates food entirely by sight.<p></p>","The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being  susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild  ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for  trade, persecution and poisoning (Ogada <em>et al</em>. 2016).  In East Africa, the primary issue is  poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide  carbofuran), which occurs primarily   outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. africanus</span> puts them both at significant risk as it means they inevitably spend  considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010,   Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Kendall and  Virani 2012). In  addition, the ungulate wildlife  populations on which this species relies have  declined precipitously throughout East  Africa, even in protected areas  (Western <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/>In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2007)<strong></strong>. In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong> and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2007)<strong></strong>. The West African population has been heavily exploited for trade, with birds commonly sold in fetish markets (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Nikolaus 2006, Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015)<strong></strong>. It is one of the most commonly traded vultures in West and Central African markets, with numbers traded (1,128-1,692 individuals over a six year period in West Africa) probably representing a significant proportion of the regional population (Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015), with vultures being used in traditional medicine (W. Goodwin <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Dogon of central Mali climb the Hombori cliffs to take eggs and chicks of this species (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>. The decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria appears to be entirely  attributable to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju  practices (P. Hall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011). It is apparently also captured for international trade. In 2005, 30 birds were reportedly confiscated by the Italian authorities (F. Genero <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Disturbance, especially from climbers, is a particular problem for this species. In Mali, the Hombori and Dyounde massifs are dotted with at least 47 climbing routes, on which expeditions take place every year, mainly during the species's breeding season. However, the impact of these activities is not known (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>. Climate change may be causing a shift in suitable habitat, which may explain the increased sightings in Northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula (Garrido <em>et al. </em>2020).

It is one of the most commonly traded vultures in West and Central African markets, with numbers traded (1,128-1,692 individuals over a six year period in West Africa) probably representing a significant proportion of the regional population (Buij&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015), with vultures being used in traditional medicine (W.

In South-East Asia it was found in open and partly wooded country, generally in the lowlands. This species feeds almost entirely on carrion, scavenging at carcass dumps and slaughterhouses, and at carcasses dumped in the fields and along rivers. It has only been recorded nesting in trees, usually large ones, usually at a height of 7-25 m, sometimes near villages but usually more remote. It is a solitary nester. While feeding, considerable mixed species aggregations can form (where it can be one of the more regularly aggressive vulture species [Hille <em>et al. </em>2016]), and regular communal roost sites are used. It is social and usually found in conspecific flocks, interacting with other vultures at carcasses. Movements are poorly known, and the degree of connectivity of apparently separate populations is not known. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services. They were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India.<br/><p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported. The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality. Vultures are exposed to diclofenac (and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs [NSAIDs]) through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume (as is tradition in Hindu cultures).&#160;Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs that therefore cause renal failure and death&#160;(<strong></strong>Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, <strong></strong>Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, <strong></strong>Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006).<strong></strong>&#160;Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in <em>Gyps</em> vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004)&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Anon 2009)<strong></strong>, potentially leading to a slower uptake of a vulture safe alternative drug (meloxicam). Also, despite bans and the wide availability of meloxicam, diclofenac is still widely found in carcasses and vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014, 2016).&#160;This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015).&#160;Other veterinary drugs (ketoprofen, flunixin, nimesulide, aceclofenac and fenbendazole) have also recently been identified to be potentially lethal to vulture&#160;species (Naidoo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009,&#160;Zorrilla <em>et al.</em> 2015, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2016, Galligan <em>et al. </em>2016, Sharma 2016).<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably results from the collapse of large wild mammal populations due to overhunting and improved management of deceased livestock leading to scarcity of available food (Clements<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013), but persecution and poisoning is also thought to be a problem. In Cambodia vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides (S. Mahood&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012; Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Other potential contributory factors to declines in this species are direct persecution, pesticide use and electrocution/ collision with energy infrastructure (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017) but these are probably of minor significance.","Considerable confusion over the taxonomy and identification of <em>Gyps</em> vultures has occurred, making it difficult to be sure of the population size. In 2015, the population was estimated to be c.1,000 individuals in India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2019; MoEFCC 2020), 47 individuals in Cambodia (Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016), fewer than 50 individuals in Nepal (DNPWC 2015), and a single breeding pair in Bangladesh (MoEF 2016). Very little is known about the size of the population in Myanmar, however counts made at vulture restaurants during 2003-2006 suggest a population of c.21 individuals (Hla&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010). The total population is therefore thought to be c.1,100-1,300 individuals, roughly equating to 730-870 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps tenuirostris</em> is found in <strong>India</strong> north of, and including, the Gangetic plain, west to at least Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, south to southern West Bengal (and possibly northern Orissa), east through the plains of Assam, and through southern <strong>Nepal</strong>, and north and central <strong>Bangladesh</strong>. It formerly occurred more widely in South-East Asia, but it is now thought to be extinct in Thailand and Malaysia, and the only recent records are from <strong>Cambodia</strong>, southern <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Myanmar</strong>. Considerable confusion over the taxonomy and identification of <em>Gyps </em>vultures has occurred, making it difficult to be sure of claims for this species. However, it appears to be allopatric or parapatric with Indian Vulture <em>G. indicus</em> where their ranges abut (or potentially do so) in northern India. <br/><br/>It was once common, but in South-East Asia populations declined through the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, and are now probably very small and restricted in distribution and limited mainly to Cambodia (where the first nests recorded in the country were recently found and surveys in 2015 recorded a total of 47 individuals at vulture 'restaurants' [Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016]) and Myanmar (counts made at vulture restaurants suggest a population of c.21 individuals [Hla <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010]). Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in the region is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005). <br/><br/>In India and Nepal, the species was common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s it has suffered a catastrophic decline of up to 96.8%, with a combined average decline in India of this species and <em>G. indicus</em> of over 16% annually between 2000 and 2007 (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In Nepal the species was formerly fairly common and widespread, but during 2002-2011 it declined by 18.7% per year (Chaudhary&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), although there may have since been a partial recovery (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;It is now extremely rare in the east of Nepal and local and uncommon in the centre and west (Inskipp <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, <strong></strong>Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004,<strong></strong> Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005).<strong></strong> This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses, leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,b<strong></strong>; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Probably owing to the effects of diclofenac, breeding success in parts of its Indian range is reportedly low; of 14 nests found in Assam just four had chicks (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population. Likewise, surveys conducted in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007 found no firm evidence of diclofenac use (Eames 2007).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices I &amp; II, Raptors MOU Category 1. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the veterinary use of diclofenac, and Bangladesh followed suit in 2010. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India in 2008 warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, which is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert et al. 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on Gyps vultures with no ill-effects (Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert et al. 2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs (Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). Conservation activities include: meeting key groups (e.g. pharmacists, veterinarians and livestock owners); engaging government officials (e.g. drug control, livestock services and forest departments) at tehsil, district and state levels; engaging with the public (e.g. festival programmes, media coverage and signage); diclofenac-free district declaration; community-run formal or informal Vulture Safe Feeding Sites (i.e., vulture [Jatayu] restaurants); vulture-related income generation for villages at nesting or feeding sites; diclofenac-meloxicam exchanges; husbandry and veterinary training camps; and national and international ecotourism to feeding sites and conservation breeding sites (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). There are currently 12 provisional Vulture Safe Zones being established in countries including India, Nepal and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research - in Cambodia these are run by The Cambodia Vulture Conservation Project and a partnership between national and international conservation NGOs (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, H. Rainey <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., in order to develop suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that they provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts began in 2006 when 18 Slender-billed Vultures were captured for the captive-breeding facility in Pinjore, India. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. In April 2008, there were 28 birds at the three Indian breeding centres (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, increasing to 35 birds in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Two individuals bred in captivity for the first time in 2009. By November 2015, the total number in breeding centres in India was 218, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015).&#160;The Central Zoo Authority of India has also set up several Vulture Consevration Breeding centres (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<em>&#160;</em>A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive breeding efforts that represent the full geographical spread of the species (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Wildlife Trust of India and the Assam Forest Department (Wildlife Trust of India 2019).&#160;Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, accompanied by searches for nesting colonies, research into vulture deaths and investigation of possible diclofenac use in livestock (Eames 2007). <br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha et al. 2017). An updated 5-year (2020-2025) action plan has been produced for vulture conservation in India (MoEFCC 2020), a 9-year (2016-2025) action plan for Cambodia (Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016) and Bangladesh (MoEF 2016), and a 4-year (2015-2019) action plan was was written for Nepal but has not been updated (DNPWC 2015). In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered Gyps vultures that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Multiple Conservation Actions were proposed as part of SAVE (2014) and SAVE (2015). Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac (as well as the removal of human-use diclofenac in vials of &gt;3 ml), and attempt to implement a ban on other vulture-toxic NSAIDs. Regulate the production of veterinary drugs to identify vulture-safe NSAIDs. Support species management or restoration, as needed. Initiate public awareness and public support programmes. Identify the location and number of remaining individuals and identify actions required to prevent extinction. Monitor remaining populations, in particular replicate conservation and research activities in Myanmar that have been implemented in Cambodia. Provide supplementary food sources where necessary for food-limited populations in South-East Asia, and maintain and promote Vulture Safe Zones, including trans-boundary efforts. Within VSZs, promote livestock management training and provide free veterinary camps. Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres, and identify the most appropriate sites for release of captive-bred individuals. Attempt to estimate the potential value, in terms of ecosystem services, provided by wild vultures. Protect nesting areas.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It has a broad diet including carrion, tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and even faeces (Margalida <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dobrev <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016).

The population crash in the Cape Verde Islands has been attributed to a rise in mortality due to the former use of long-lasting pesticides (some of which, although now illegal, are still easily bought and used), the ongoing poisoning of stray dogs, and a decrease in food availability due to urbanisation, rural abandonment and better sanitation (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2020).<em>&#160;</em>Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional ""<em>muladares</em>"" in Spain and Portugal<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Donázar 2004, J.

Similarly, closures of over 300 small rubbish dumps in Oman as part of an upgrade in waste management may reduce food availability (S. Al Touqi, cited in McGrady <em>et al. </em>2018), although a study in Turkey found no short-term effect on reproductive success of closure of rubbish dumps (Katzenberger <em>et al. </em>2017). In parts of the range where transhumance occurs, there may be asymmetries in food availability at different times of year (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2018). However, recently passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers and guidelines about how to operate them exist&#160;(A. Brunner<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al.</em> 2010), and in eastern Europe dietary diversity has no effect on population sizes, but instead could affect territory size (Dobrev&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Poisoning is a significant threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2009, Cortés-Avizanda <a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623""><em>et al</em>. 2009, 2015 Sanz-Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2015b, Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2016</a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a>), and through the consumption of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries including Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted potential contamination of Egyptian Vultures that may lead to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease&#160;(e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria<strong><sup> </sup></strong>[Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008]).&#160;<br/><br/>It appears that diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International 2008), is driving the recent rapid declines in India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, A. Rahmani <em>in litt</em>. 2012, Galligan <em>et al. </em>2014). NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by <em>Gyps</em> spp. vultures<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006). In 2007, diclofenac was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). This drug has recently been approved for veterinary use in Europe, and is commercially available in France and Spain, which is a major concern for the species (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2007a) and &#160;potentially risky in other regions of Spain (<a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623"">Donázar and Benítez <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span></a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a> 2007, Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and in Africa (Nikolaus 1984, 2006), with 17 individuals found killed by electrocution in Port Sudan, over 10 days in&#160; 2010 (I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2010, Angelov <em>et al. </em>2013a), indicating a potentially serious problem that has persisted for decades and will continue to contribute to Egyptian Vulture population declines. In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W. Goodwin <em>in litt. </em>2016). Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture (<em>Gyps fulvus</em>) may reduce breeding success<strong><sup> </sup></strong>in the short-term (Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008). <span style=""font-style: italic;""><p></p></span>","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number&#160;3,000-4,500 breeding pairs, equating to&#160;6,100-9,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms 25-49% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 12,400-36,000 mature individuals, roughly equating to 18,600-54,000 individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occupies a large range with isolated resident populations in the<strong> </strong>Cabo Verde and Canary Islands in the west (although they may still have some connectivity to the continental population&#160;[Agudo <em>et al. </em>2011]), through <strong>Morocco</strong>&#160;(Amezian and Khamlichi 2015) and parts of West Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie&#160; 2001). A small resident population persists in <strong>Angola</strong> and <strong>Namibia</strong>. The bulk of the resident population occurs in <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and East Africa, Arabia and the Indian Subcontinent, while Saharan and Sahelian parts of Africa in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Algeria</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Niger,</span> northernmost <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cameroon, Chad</span> and northern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sudan</span> also hold significant but presumably smaller populations (I.

Migratory birds breed in northernmost Africa (Morocco, Algeria, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tunisia, Libya,</span>&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Egypt</span>), southern Europe from<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Spain</span> in the west through the Mediterranean, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Turkey</span>, the Caucasus and central Asia to northern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Iran,</span> <strong>Pakistan</strong>, northern <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Nepal</strong>. These birds winter within the resident range, and in addition throughout the Sahel region of Africa. Global population estimates for the species are crude, but 3,000-4,500 pairs are estimated in Europe (BirdLife International <em>in prep</em>), &lt; 2,000 pairs in central Asia, just a few thousand pairs now in the Indian Subcontinent,  perhaps 1,000 pairs in the Middle East, and perhaps 1,000-2,000 pairs in Africa (Thiollay 1989, I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).&#160;The population size in Europe is estimated to have decreased by 50-79% in 53.4 years (three generations) (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;In Spain, which with c.1,300 pairs may support as much as 40% of the European breeding population, the number of territories declined by at least 25% between 1987-2000 (i.e. equating to a decline of &gt;50% over three generations)<sup><strong> </strong></sup>(Donázar 2004, Del Moral 2009), likely due to high mortality rates (Cortés-Avizanda <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The Spanish population was estimated to be stable for the period 1998-2011 (BirdLife International 2015, Tauler <em>et al. </em>2015), and the adjacent French population appears to be increasing (Lieury <em>et al.</em> 2015), although 2015 appeared to be a bad year there (Vulture Conservation Foundation 2016). Balkan populations are however still declining at 4-8% per year, with the population in <strong>Greece</strong>&#160;having declined by 44-60% over 30 years&#160;(Xirouchakis and Tsiakiris 2009, Grubač&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Velevski <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declines are reported from the Middle East<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(S. Aspinall <em>in litt.</em> 2005), e.g. 50-75% in <strong>Israel</strong>, however in <strong>Oman</strong> the population appears stable or increasing&#160;(J. Eriksen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2005, Al Bulushi <em>et al. </em>2013, Angelov <em>et al. </em>2013b), although this may be more a reflection of count methods rather than genuine stability in the population. Around 1,900 birds are resident in a stable population on the island of Socotra (Porter and Suleiman 2012). The resident populations within Africa have declined by 5.9% per year over the past 29-36 years &#160;(Ogada <em>et al.</em> 2016), including those in Ethiopia and <strong>Djibouti<sup> </sup></strong>(G. Mulholland <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Arkumarev&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014), Kenya (Virani <em>et al. </em>2011),&#160;and Angola and Namibia (where just 10 pairs remain)<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(R. Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 2006). Across much of Africa residents are outnumbered by migrant European and probably Asian breeders<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(J. M. Thiollay <em>in litt</em>. 2006, I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The species has gone Extinct in the region of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Taylor <em>et al. </em>2015), and is Extinct as a breeding species in Namibia (Simmons 2015).&#160;Most critically, the species has undergone a catastrophic decline (&gt;35% per year) since 1999 in India, where numbers detected on road transects declined by 68% between 2000 and 2003<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006), but the recent ban on Diclofenac may have arrested the decline of the Indian population (Galligan <em>et al</em>. 2014).<em><p></p></em>","In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W.

The veterinary drug diclofenac has now been banned by the Indian government. In 2007, a survey began to establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). &#160;Due to the recent legalisation of diclofenac for veterinary use in the EU, there is an active campaign against the use of diclofenac in the European Union (http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia/project/ban-veterinary-diclofenac). An International species action plan for the species was published in 2008 (Iñigo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). National species action plans are in place in France, Bulgaria and Italy, and the species is included in the Balkan Vulture Action Plan (BVAP). Efforts are being taken to release captive-bred individuals in parts of Italy. In Spain, France, Italy, Bulgaria and Macedonia birds have been fitted with satellite-tags to study juvenile dispersion, migratory movements and wintering areas (e.g. García-Ripollés <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010,&#160;López-López&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2015). Nest guarding schemes for pairs that are most threatened by poachers have been implemented in Italy and Bulgaria, where very small populations survive (Zuberogoitia<em> et al.</em> 2014, Oppel<em> et al. </em>2016). Expeditions to study the limiting factors in the wintering areas and along the migration flyway have taken place together with local organizations in Mauritania, Senegal, Ethiopia, Sudan and Turkey (Arkumarev <em>et al.</em> 2014, Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2014). A training seminar was held in Ethiopia to help build capacity for conservation of the species on its African wintering grounds (Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds 2013). A LIFE-Nature project in the Canary Islands has significantly enhanced adult and sub-adult survival through actions including education campaigns, control of illegal poisoning and modification of power lines (Badia-Boher <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian vultures was published in 2017 (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and an international Flyway Action Plan for the Central Asian and Balkan populations was initiated in 2015 in Bulgaria, encompassing the Balkans, Central Asia, Middle East, and East Africa (S. Oppel <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species is considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Uganda (WCS 2016).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Start and maintain intensive cooperation with local stakeholders to ensure poison- and poaching-free zones at sites with high densities or congregations of the species throughout the breeding, migration and wintering range, alongside similar efforts for other threatened species. Build capacity in countries along the migration flyways and in the wintering areas. There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies in Namibia (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). Research threats, monitor populations and protect key sites along migratory pathways and bottlenecks along the Red Sea Flyway (Buechley <em>et al. </em>2018). Protect nest sites where persecution is a problem. Research the causes and extent of current declines across the species's range. Insulate dangerous electricity pylons in areas where high mortality is recorded.  Coordinate monitoring to assess trends throughout the range. Relax the European Union sanitary regulations in relation to carcass disposal. Establish supplementary feeding sites based on rigorous scientific knowledge and under adaptive and appropriate management (Moreon-Opo <em>et al. </em>2015, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al. </em>2016). Raise awareness amongst pastoralists of the dangers of using diclofenac for livestock<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. Effectively reduce risks of poisoning through strict enforcement of poison-bait ban and education. Lobby for the banning of diclofenac for veterinary purposes throughout the species's range, and support the enforcement of this ban where it has been adopted. Where applicable, establish the impact of wind turbines, and lobby for effective impact assessments to be carried out prior to their construction. Where  appropriate, guard nests to reduce disturbance. Confiscate illegally  kept live birds and use them for the purposes of captive breeding and  future restocking and reintroduction programmes. In key areas of the  species's range, implement long-term and large-scale education and  community involvement programmes. The Flyway Action Plan for the conservation of the Egyptian Vulture in Central Asia and the Balkans (2017) additionally highlighted: the need to improve detection methods and better understand the causes of poisoning and illegal killing; legislation and enforcement to mitigate illegal killing; raise awareness of illegal killing; mitigate electrocution and collisions with energy infrastructure; raise awareness amongst planners and developers of dangerous energy infrastructure; monitor breeding pairs, productivity and success rate; protect breeding sites and foraging habitats; and ensure a successful <em>ex situ</em>&#160;Egyptian Vulture endangered species programme.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Only a small, very rapidly declining population remains, owing primarily to poisoning and persecution, as well as ecosystem alterations. Data published in 2016 suggests that the population in Africa is declining extremely rapidly, and future population assessments may lead to further uplisting.<br/><p></p>","The species inhabits dry savanna, arid plains, deserts and open mountain slopes (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, up to 3,500 m (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In Ethiopia, it is also found at the edge of forests, having been recorded at Bonga Forest and forest in Bale Mountains National Park in 2007, as well as the Afro-alpine habitats of the national park in 2005 (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. It ranges widely when foraging (P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong> and is mainly a scavenger, feeding predominantly on any large carcasses or their remains (Mundy 1982, Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). It is also known to hunt, probably taking a variety of small reptiles, fish, birds and mammals, and has been observed apparently group-hunting flamingo <em>Phoenicopterus</em> chicks (McCulloch 2006a, 2006b). It builds solitary nests (containing just one egg), often in <em>Acacia</em> (its distribution sometimes being limited by these trees' distribution [Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997]<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>), but also in <em>Balanites</em> and <em>Terminalia</em> (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It does not breed until at least six years old, then fledging c.0.4 young/pair/year (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). Ringing studies in Namibia have revealed a very low return rate (Simmons and Bridgeford 1997). The species's minimum home range has been suggested to be 8 km<sup>2</sup>, and this can expand to 15 km<sup>2</sup> in some habitats (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005), but it may now be that 80-150km<sup>2 </sup>may be more appropriate (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). In Mozambique, egg-laying occurs from late April until mid-August, with a peak in May and June (Parker 2005). A nest found in Oman contained a small chick in early March, and thought to have fledged in mid-June (Wernery 2009).<br/><p></p>","Widespread accidental poisoning, largely due to strychnine, used by many farmers for predator control,  and more recently carbofuran, has contributed significantly to declines (Brown 1986, P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 2000, Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010, C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Several Lappet-faced Vultures&#160;were found to have died after feeding on the carcass of a poisoned jackal in Namibia (Komen 2009) and two birds were killed as a result of feeding on a poisoned carcass in Kenya (Kendall and Virani 2012). A mass poisoning event involving at least 15 Lappet-faced Vultures occurred in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012&#160;(Groom <em>et al</em>. 2012), while another in Botswana in 2019 resulted in the death of 14 Lappet-faced Vultures (BirdGuides 2019). The upper beaks of eight of these birds were removed suggesting that they may be traded for traditional medicine.&#160;It is also often mistakenly persecuted as a livestock predator (Brown 1986): one major deliberate poisoning incident killed 86 individuals in Namibia (Simmons 1995)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>Other major threats to the species include nest predation by humans, reduced food availability (including the replacement of the traditional ""Dabokka"" movement of camels with cargo tracks [H. Ibrahim <em>in litt. </em>2016])&#160;and electrocution (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Increasing use of agricultural pesticides may also be a problem for the species (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992), including those breeding at Tayma, Saudi Arabia (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nest disturbance, to which it is extremely sensitive (Steyn 1982)<strong></strong>, may be growing with an increase in forest settlements in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong> and the increasing recreational use of off-road vehicles (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992).&#160;In Saudi Arabia, suitable nesting trees may be subject to the most intense human disturbance as shepherds also use the same large trees for shelter for themselves and their livestock (Shobrak 2011).&#160;Breeding birds at Tayma could face disturbance from motorised vehicles in the desert (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nest trees are also susceptible to fire and are often pushed over by elephants (Murn and Botha <em>in prep.</em>), although tree availability is not thought to be a limiting factor for the species (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>The population collapse in West Africa may be a result of higher nest disturbance, local extinctions of wild ungulates through habitat modification and over-hunting, intensified cattle farming in which sick or dying animals are rarely abandoned, and an increase in accidental poisoning<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Thiollay 2006<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>, although the latter threat, in particular, requires further study (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). National vaccination campaigns in West Africa have reduced illness in domestic livestock, and sick animals can now be sold off, rather than abandoned, due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). The species may be hunted for medicine and cultural reasons in West Africa, and some ethnic groups in the sub-region hunt vultures for food, though the impact on this species is unknown (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). It is also thought to be used for traditional medicine in South Africa, with all vultures having the potential for traditional medicine use in southern Africa (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2013, W. Goodwin <em>in litt.</em> 2016) and has been recorded in trade in West and Central African markets (Buij <em>et al</em>. 2016). With 858-1,284 individuals reported to have been traded over a six year period in West Africa, numbers traded represent a potentially significant proportion of the regional population.<br/><br/>In central Mozambique, the population has declined due to a scarcity of game and livestock following the armed conflict of the 1970s and 1980s, and the surviving population continues to be threatened by the over-exploitation of game by poachers (Parker 2005). There are incidences of deliberate poisoning by poachers, due to the belief that the arriving vultures will give away the locations of poached animals (Hancock 2009, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2015). In Ethiopia, the principal threat to the species is habitat loss on the lowland plains (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007, 2012)<strong></strong>. Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species.<p></p>","Data from Mundy <em>et al. </em>(1992) suggest the African population is at least 8,000 individuals, equating to c.5,330 mature individuals. National estimates for Africa include 160-500 individuals in Uganda (Pomeroy <em>et al. </em>2015), 150-200 pairs in South Africa (Barnes 2000), c.2,000 individuals in Tanzania (Shimelis <em>et al. </em>2005), 300 pairs in Zimbabwe (Boshoff <em>et al. </em>1997), 400-500 pairs in Ethiopia (Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005), 10-20 pairs in Egypt (Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005) and 500 pairs in Namibia (Simmons and Brown, cited in Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). There are an estimated 600 pairs in the Arabian Peninsula (Jennings 2010, cited in Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The total population is therefore estimated to be least 9,200 individuals, of which c.6530 are mature individuals, although this may prove to be an overestimate given current trends for this species.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;breeds in <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Senegal</strong>, <strong>Niger</strong>, <strong>Mauritania</strong>, <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Burkina Faso</strong>, <strong>Chad</strong>, <strong>Sudan</strong>, <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, <strong>Somalia</strong>, <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, <strong>Rwanda</strong>, <strong>Uganda</strong>, <strong>Kenya</strong>, <strong>Tanzania</strong>, <strong>Zambia</strong>, <strong>Malawi</strong>, <strong>Mozambique</strong>, <strong>Namibia</strong>, <strong>Botswana</strong>, <strong>Zimbabwe</strong>, <strong>South Africa</strong>, <strong>Eswatini</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> (an increasing population, in excess of 500 individuals [Newton and Shobrak 1993, M.

It is considered likely to be extinct in Western Sahara, as it has not been recorded there since 1955 (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Nigeria, there has been a major decline since the late 1970s and it may now have been extirpated (Brown 1986, Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005).

The combination of these results with comparable transect surveys from Burkina Faso indicate a decline in abundance of c.97% in rural areas and c.39% in national parks between 1969-1973 and 2003-2004 (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>, and declines of 50% were also recorded between 1978-1986 and 2003-2005 on transects in the Masai Mara, Kenya (Virani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011). It is suffering a slow decline in southern Africa (Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997); the largest conservation area in South Africa (Kruger National Park) contains only approximately 50 nests (Murn and Botha <em>in press</em>) and populations are likely to disappear in South Africa should current levels of exploitation and other pressures continue (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;However the population in central Mozambique is probably stable (Parker 2005)<strong></strong>. There are possibly 1,000 pairs (almost 3,000 individuals) in southern Africa, at least the same in eastern and northeastern Africa, and possibly only c.500 pairs in West Africa and the Sahara, giving a total rough estimate of the African population of at least 8,000 individuals (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). However, given the age of this estimate this may prove to be an overestimate (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016)<em> </em>as<em> </em>Ogada <em>et al</em>.

It breeds in a number of protected areas within its extensive range. Road surveys in Uganda only recorded the species within protected areas (Pomeroy <em>et al. </em>2015). Ecological research is ongoing, notably in Saudi Arabia (Newton and Shobrak 1993)<strong></strong> and southern Africa (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016). Following a workshop, a five-year international action plan for the species was published in 2005, with the aims of stabilising or increasing its populations, improving knowledge of its distribution, population size and trends and minimising the impact of human activities at key sites (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). A comprehensive study of the species in Botswana was planned for 2007 (P. Hancock<em> in litt.</em> 2006), and 221 chicks were marked with patagial tags between 2006 and 2009 (Bridgeford 2009)<strong></strong>. In 2007, a survey began to  establish the extent of diclofenac use for  veterinary purposes in  Tanzania (BirdLife International 2007)<strong></strong>,  and in 2008 an  awareness-raising campaign at a conference of the World  Organisation for  Animal Health in Senegal led to a resolution  being  adopted unanimously  by more than 160 delegates to ""request Members to  consider their  national situation with the aim to seek  measures to  find solutions to  the problems caused by the administration  of  diclofenac in livestock""  (Woodford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to respond to and neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 2008 feeding stations were set up in the south of Egypt, at Shalatin, following the decline of vultures in the area (H. Ibrahim <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;The species is listed as locally Vulnerable in Namibia (Simmons and Brown 2015), Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan 2015), and Critically Endangered in the National red list for Uganda (WCS 2016).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Organise coordinated surveys and monitoring throughout its range to clarify population size and decline rates. Conduct further ecological research (Brown 1986, <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997, Shobrak in press<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>. Initiate awareness campaigns aimed at farmers, local communities, developers and ecotourists to reduce mortality from persecution, accidental poisoning and disturbance (Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Harrison&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, <strong></strong><strong></strong>Barnes 2000, Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005, Shobrak 2011, Shobrak in press). There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies in Namibia (Craig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Identify important nesting areas (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Carry out research into the effects of nest disturbance (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005) and nest loss (Murn <em>in prep.</em>). Improve awareness amongst utilities and NGOs of hazardous pylon designs and suitable measures to prevent collisions through training courses and literature such as posters and best practice manuals (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Increase awareness amongst farmers of suitable reservoir and drinking trough modification methods (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Enforce legislation concerned with incorrect use of poisons and pesticides (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Carry out research into the impacts of different poisons across its range (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Study the impact of the species on livestock numbers and share information with stakeholders (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Enact legislation against the persecution of the species (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Encourage vulture feeding sites and the abandonment of livestock carcasses from death by natural causes (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Provide enforcement for existing nature reserves in West Africa and design of a new one in northern Mali<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Thiollay 2006)<strong></strong>. In West Africa, determine the severity of accidental poisoning, hunting of the species for medicine and cultural reasons, hunting for food, and the threat from the development of powerlines (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). Complete a vulture census for West Africa (Anderson 2005)<strong></strong>. Eliminate the veterinary  use of diclofenac and other toxic drugs in  Africa.&#160;A number of recommendations were produced at the 2012 Pan-Africa Vulture Summit (Botha&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016): 1) Regulate import, manufacture and sale of poisons; 2) Legislate and enforce measures to prosecute those involved in illegal killing and trade in vulture species; 3) Protect and effectively manage breeding sites; 4) Ensure new energy infrastructure is ""vulture-friendly"" and modify existing unsafe infrastructure; 5) Support activities to conserve vulture populations, including research and outreach activities.

Recent data suggests the already small population is declining at an extremely rapid rate owing to a variety of threats including poisoning, persecution and ecosystem alterations. The species has a very small population and local extinctions may be accelerated by major poisoning events in isolated localised subpopulations.<p></p>","It prefers mixed, dry woodland at low altitudes, avoiding semi-arid thornbelt areas (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It also occurs up to 4,000 m in Ethiopia, and perhaps 3,000 m in Kenya, and ranges across the thorny <em>Acacia</em>-dominated landscape of Botswana (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It generally avoids human habitation (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. The species is thought to be a long-lived resident that maintains a territory (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994, Murn and Holloway 2014)<strong></strong>. It may generally fly lower than other vultures, and is often the first vulture species to arrive at carcasses (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. While it is often found on the periphery of vulture congregations at large carcasses, it is also often found at small carcasses and is probably an occasional predator (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, Murn 2014, F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. It nests and roosts in trees, most nests being in <em>Acacia</em> spp. or baobabs (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is one, the egg being laid a couple of months after rains have finished and the dry season is underway (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Pairs that breed have a success rate of 65-75% (Hustler and Howells 1988, Murn and Holloway 2014), however, up to 61% of pairs do not attempt to breed each year (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994), often due to the presence of a dependent chick from the previous breeding season (Murn and Holloway 2014)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Reductions in populations of medium-sized mammals and wild ungulates, as well as habitat conversion through agricultural intensification and development throughout its range best explain the current decline (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 1999, R. Davies <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Additional threats include indirect poisoning (R. Davies <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong> at baits set to kill jackals in small-stock farming areas, and  in East Africa at poisoned baits set for larger mammalian carnivores such as lions and hyenas (C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012),<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span> and, particularly in East Africa, secondary poisoning from carbofuran and other poisons (Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). Deliberate poisoning to prevent vultures drawing attention to poaching activities has also been documented (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2016). 17 White-headed Vultures were killed in a mass poisoning event in Botswana in 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Exploitation for the international trade in raptors (N. Baker <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong> also poses a threat. In 2005, 30 individuals of this species were confiscated by the Italian authorities (F. Genero<em> in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa (Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015). In South Africa, this species is captured for use in traditional medicines (R. E. Simmons and C. J. Brown <em>in litt.</em> 2006) and in Zambia White-headed Vultures have apparently been intentionally killed for use in witchcraft (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012).&#160;Breeding birds may readily desert nests in areas of high human disturbance (R. E. Simmons and C. J. Brown <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. The species is highly sensitive to land-use and is highly concentrated in protected areas (Hancock 2008). Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species, although livestock have not been recorded as a potential food source for this species (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","An old estimate of 7,000-12,500 mature individuals was extrapolated from a number of regional estimates. This equates to 10,500-18,750 individuals in total. However, a new estimate of the global population suggests the population is much smaller, consisting of just 5,500 individuals (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2016). This equates to just 3,685 mature individuals here placed in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;has an extremely large range in sub-Saharan Africa (from <strong>Senegal</strong>, <strong>Gambia </strong>and <strong>Guinea-Bissau</strong> disjunctly east to <strong>Eritrea</strong>, <strong>Ethiopia </strong>and <strong>Somalia</strong>, and south to easternmost <strong>South Africa</strong> and <strong>Eswatini</strong>), where it is uncommon, but generally widespread outside forested regions (Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. It has declined rapidly in parts of West Africa since the early 1940s (P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 1999, J. M. Thiollay <em>in litt</em>. 2006, 2012)<strong></strong>, is declining in East Africa (Virani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011) and in southern Africa is now largely confined to protected areas. New data suggests the regional populations are now much smaller than was previously thought: 721 nests in East Africa; 548 nests in Central Africa; 468 nests in Southern Africa and 156 nests in West Africa (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2016). In <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Botswana</span> only four nests were located during gyrocopter surveys of three Important Bird Areas during 2008 and the species has the lowest relative abundance of the vulture species recorded (Hancock 2008), while in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Niger </span>there are only four records since 1995, all in the Gadabeji area (J. Brouwer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>. The species has probably declined in central <strong>Mozambique</strong> (Parker 2005a), where the population was estimated at 200 pairs (Parker 2005b), but the entire country now contains approximately 150 pairs (Murn <em>et al. </em>2016). The largest protected area in South Africa contains approximately 50 nests (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2013, Murn and Botha <em>in press</em>), but the species is likely to disappear from the country in the near future should current levels of exploitation and other pressures continue (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2013). An extrapolated estimate of the global population suggested there were 2,600-4,700 pairs (7,000-12,500 mature individuals) (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992) however new data suggests the population is much smaller, at just 5,500 individuals (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2016).<p></p>","The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa (Buij&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).
