This assessment is based on Indian records, and may consequently be precautionary, pending clarification that recently discovered Sri Lankan subpopulations correspond to this species, since while this is thought likely to be the case this assignment is in need of validation.","This species has been recorded from species of dry, sandy scrub-clad lowlands (Ganesh and Chandramouli 2010) devoid of rocky outcrops, including areas close to the seashore (Ganesh <em>et al</em>. 2017). Srikanthan <em>et al.</em> (2018) recorded it from both grassland and dry thorn scrub, as well as in coconut groves and paddy fields. The historic record of this species in Sri Lanka is from coastal sand flats (A. Bauer pers. comm. March 2011). Species distribution modelling suggests a preference for low-elevation areas with a mean annual temperature of around 28.5 °C, rainfall below 1,000 mm a year, and relatively little difference between maximum and minimum temperatures (Srikanthan <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is strictly terrestrial and nocturnal, and shelters beneath rocks during the day (Srikanthan<em> et al.</em> 2018). In Sri Lanka it occurs in the arid zone, where it has been found beneath stones and logs in sparsely-vegetated scrub on sandy soils, and has been found in retreat sites by day (D. Jayesekara pers. comm. 2019). It exhibits strong evidence of territoriality and intraspecific aggression, with individuals separated from one another by 15-20 m (Srikanthan <em>et al.</em> 2018). Ganesh <em>et al.</em> (2017) reported that gravid females were active both in July, in the pre-monsoon season, and following the monsoon in December an February.","Habitat loss in the form of burning of grasslands and conversion into real estate, grazing and tapioca plantations, and multiple invasive plant species that increase fire risk and shade its sandy habitats. <em>Prosopis </em>is the most widespread of these, affecting most formerly suitable open habitat within its range. Sand quarrying in and around river beds and coastal dunes are causing population decline. The known distribution is almost entirely human-modified. This species only survives at all because of efforts to conserve the Black Buck along the Coromandel coastal plains, a species which is dependent on similar grassland habitat. Urban development and rural settlement threaten the species in Sri Lanka, although it occurs in habitat in this country that is not generally subject to major threats; on Mannar Island there are multiple widespread threats including wind power and tourist industry development.","This species is poorly-sampled and underrepresented in collections (Bauer <em>et al. </em>2010).

2000054,191719,Xenotoca variata,Least Concern,,2019,2018-03-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Xenotoca variata</em> is an endemic freshwater species that occurs throughout the highland waters of central Mexico, encompassing habitats over a range from 250km from W to E and 500km from N to S. However, it disappeared from many habitats due to water pollution and predatory Largemouth Bass and nowadays mainly persists in clear springs, creeks, dams and lakes. Again, the Jeweled Splitfin encompasses a second to be described species from the Río Grande de Morelia drainage. <br/><br/><br/>Even when taking in consideration the given threats, declines in AOO, EOO, locations, habitats and even subpopulations, and taking <em>Xenotoca</em> cf. <em>variata</em> out from the calculations, the remaining AOO encompasses about 4,800km², the remaining EOO about 100,000km², including at least 25 locations. Including <em>Xenotoca</em> cf.<em> variata</em>, the AOO encompassess about 5,600km², the EOO about 112, 000km². Therefore, as no threat tresholds are met, the Jeweled Splitfin is assessed of <u>Least Concern</u>.<br/><br/><br/>A separate assessment for the Lake Cuitzeo Jeweled Splitfin would lead to an AOO of about 800km² and an EOO of about 2,200km². Taking in consideration less than 10 locations, it would be assessed <u>Vulnerable</u>. Therefore, a quick valid description would be preferable.","<p><em>The Jeweled Splitfin</em><em></em><em> </em>prefers habitats like clear to murky rivers and lakes with currents of moderate to absent. It can be detected in shallow water (less than 1m deep) over substrates from deep mud to rocks. Usually, vegetation is abundant. Plant genera have been (besides much floating or attached green algae) <em>Potamogeton, Eichhornia, Nasturtium </em>and <em>Myriophyllum </em>(Miller, 2005). It is an omnivorous species and males show bright and colourful spots (speckles) on their flanks, which vary in number based one their geographical location. It is known to mainly be predated by <em>Thamnophis melanogaster</em>. The risk of predation by this snake species is thought to potentially influence the selection&#160;against speckles and produce population differentiation (Moyaho, Macias Garcia and Manjarrez, 2004).</p><p>The Lagos Los Negritos is an irregular shaped pond with a diameter  between 570 and 830m. The N corner is surrounded by reed, the rest  partly shaded by pine trees. On a survey by Köck <em>et al.</em> in 2016, <em>Xenotoca variata </em>could be found along the pebbly shore and was caught with a seine. Other fish occuring in this habitat were <em>C</em><em>hapalichthys encaustus</em>, <em>Zoogoneticus purhepechus</em>,&#160;<em>Goodea atripinnis</em>,&#160;<em>Alloophorus robustus</em>,&#160;<em>Poeciliopsis infans</em> and exotics (Tilapia, Sunfish,&#160;<em>Gambusia</em>&#160;sp.). Some smaller ponds and spring fields have not been surveyed.</p><p>The  Lago Zacapú is an irregular shaped small lagoon with an extension from  the NW to the SW, length about 670, width about 470m. In the SW corner  of the lake begins the dammed outlet, extending ENE upward over a length  of about 800m and 60m wide over the whole length. The outlet ends with a  southwards bended hook with an extension of 150x90m. After the dam, the  affluent of the Canal or Río Angulo begins and merges into it after  about 6.5km. Köck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) found the  species in good numbers on two sites of the lagoon in shallow water in the free water column.  The water was on one place greenish brown but clear with little current  and partly shaded by trees, on the other place brownish clear, current  none as well. Other species found at the first spot were&#160;<em>Skiffia lermae</em>, <em>Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis</em>,&#160;<em>Goodea atripinnis</em>,&#160;<em>Allotoca zacapuensis&#160;</em>and<em>&#160;Hubbsina turneri,&#160;</em>at the second site the same species except the Zacapú Allotoca.&#160;</p><p>The  Lago Zacapú is fed by approximately 20 cold water springs (19°C), which  emerge at the southwestern end of the valley of Zacapú, some of which  are used for human consumption and recreation (Ramsar Secretariat, Site  No.1465, 2004). Also, with the confluence of fish species, migratory  birds, plants and endemic amphibians (<em>Ambystoma andersoni</em>), it  can be considered as a broad transitional zone, giving it great  ecological importance. Two main sections of Lago Zacapú differ, with one  of depths between 4 to 6m, and the other region from 12 to 90m deep,  bedded by soils and alluvium (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1465, 2004).</p><p>The spring habitat near Sain Alto encompassed on a survey by Köck <em>et al.</em> in 2015 several shallow ditches with moderate current, not deeper than 20cm, wide about 30cm. On some places, the ditches opened to larger pools of several metres in diameter, still being very shallow. The spring itself had a temperature of about 38°C. Fish were seen as soon as the temperature reached convenient temperature below 28°C. The Jeweled Splitfin was the only species in these ditches. <br/></p><p>The species was seen on several places by Köck <em>et al.</em> on two surveys in 2017 along the ríos Turbio, Guanajuato and Laja, encompassing moderate flowing parts of fast flowing creeks. The habitats were usually composed of grounds with sand, gravel and rocks, abundant green algae where the fish used to hide below. Along the Río Turbio, it was even found directly in a man-made spring near the Arroyo Cerro la Cruz and in the following dam. Both stocks looked different in colouration due to different habitats. The fish in the clear spring were beautifully coloured while the fish from the turbid dam looked more dull. <br/></p><p>La Mintzita, habitat of the related <em>Xenotoca</em> cf. <em>variata</em>, is a marshy spring–fed lake of about 80m diameter that  drains into the Río Grande de Morelia and hence into the Lago Cuitzeo.  The Río Grande de Morelia/Cuitzeo basin is endorheic, although its fauna  indicates that it was once connected to the adjacent Río Lerma basin.  Most of the Río Grande de Morelia/Cuitzeo system has been greatly  degraded, and La Mintzita is one of the last remaining high-quality  sites in the basin. A few hundred metres below the lake the outlet canal  receives wastes from a large paper mill (Bio Papel Scribe S.A. de C.V.)  and no longer has the capability to support fish life, so La Mintzita  is isolated from other fish populations in the basin. Lyons&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2004)  sampled the outlet canal just below the lake with a backpack  electroshocker and the lake itself just above the outlet with a seine.  The canal was about 8m wide and 0.5-1m deep with a fast strong current  and gravel bottom. In 80m of sampling, they collected the following  Goodeids: 3&#160;<em>Alloophrous robustus</em>, 30&#160;<em>Goodea atripinnis</em>, about 100&#160;<em>Xenotoca&#160;</em>cf.&#160;<em>variata</em>, 5&#160;<em>Skiffia lermae</em>, and about 15&#160;<em>Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis</em>. They also caught 10&#160;<em>Poeciliopsis infans</em>&#160;(Poeciliidae; native) and about 25&#160;<em>Xiphophorus helleri</em>&#160;(an exotic Poeciliid), plus 10&#160;<em>Yuriria alta</em>&#160;(Cyprinidae; native) and 10&#160;<em>Scartomyzon austrinus</em>. They then pulled the seine over about 300m<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the lake, which averaged about 1m deep with a sand and clay bottom and clear water at 15-19°C temperature. They captured 3&#160;<em>A. robustus</em>, 5&#160;<em>G. atripinnis</em>, 30&#160;<em>X.&#160;</em>cf.&#160;<em>variata</em>, about 100&#160;<em>S. lermae</em>, 3&#160;<em>Z. quitzeoensis</em>, plus at least 1,000&#160;<em>P. infans</em>, 5&#160;<em>X. helleri</em>, and 30&#160;<em>Y. alta</em>&#160;(Lyons, 2004).</p><p>This species can be found also in the Cuitzeo lake, the oldest and second largest Mexican lake that covers  an area of about 500km² including the marshy grass surrounding it. It is  irregular shaped with northern, western an eastern sections, connected  by marshland in the middle. The W-section is divided into an E- and a  W-part by two N-S dams, built for HW's 43 and 43B. The lake is astatic  and very shallow (about 0.5m deep), of muddy ground with murky water. In  dry years, the W-part of the W section is being isolated completely  from the E-part by closing the passages under the roads to save the  W-section from drying up completely. With this method, at least the  E-part of the W-section keeps water. The lake is surrounded by partly  dense and large reed areas. In open water areas directly at the HW43B dam,  Köck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;were able to find many specimens on a survey in November 2014, but fewer in January 2015.</p><p><br/></p><p>Pictures of habitats attached.</p>","Though the Jeweled Splitfin is a robust fish species, it has been eliminated from many habitats by water pollution and is still threatened by it. It is able to compete with most of the introduced exotic fish species, but is predated by Largemouth Bass and disappeared from habitats where this species has been introduced. The centre of the species, the Río Lerma basin and its affluents from Guanajuato is the centre of agriculture and heavily modified and destroyed. Most of the bigger rivers are biologically dead and the species is only able to survive in its headwaters, even here threatened by pollution or introduced Sunfish and Largemouth Bass. Guanajuato is also boasting some of the biggest cities in Mexico, all of them fast growing with industrial areas on its borders. Some of the known habitats are simply overgrown by the cities. A channel, connecting the Laguna Yuriría with the Lago Cuitzeo lake was built to provide the lagoon with water. At this time (1957) it was not expected to find two species of <em>Xenotoca </em>within these two water bodies. It is not sure if this connection led to any hybrids, however, <em>Xenotoca variata</em> from the Yuriría disappared due to water pollution which means a certain degree of safety for the remaining related species in the Cuitzeo lake.","As the Jeweled Splitfin is distributed over a wide range and does occur in many different subpopulations with different status, it becomes necessary to estimate the situation of each of these subpopulations separately. Taking in consideration, that two species and different lineages are encompassed within <em>Xenotoca variata</em>, the taxonomic concept is the following here.<br/><br/><em>Xenotoca variata</em> (with an EOOmax of about 100,000km² and an AOOmax of 4,800km²): <br/><br/>Clade A<u><br/></u><u></u><u>Río Grande de Santiago/ Laguna Chapala subpopulation</u>: This  subpopulation has gone from a huge part of its original range and is now  restricted to the Lagos Los Negritos ponds about 25km SE of the Chapala  lake. A habitat range below 0.5km² and a single location lead to an  assessment as Critically Endangered. &#160;&#160;&#160; <br/>Clade B<br/><u>Río Aguanaval subpopulation</u>: This subpopulation is known from two  spring areas. One is in the village of La Valenciana only about 20km  from the border to Durango, the second one close to Sain Alto, about  60km NW of Fresnillo, both within the federal state of Zacatecas.  Restricted to two spring areas, this subpopulation is regarded  Endangered. &#160;&#160;&#160; <br/>Clade C<u><br/></u><u></u><u>Río Angulo subpopulation</u>: It is still numerous within the Lago  Zacapú and in springs and creeks located along the Río Angulo and the  Canal La Patera. It is regarded Vulnerable. &#160;&#160;&#160; <br/>Clade D<br/><u>Río Santa María subpopulation</u>: It only occurs in a restricted range along the Río Santa María, being threatened by droughts. It is regarded Endangered. <br/><u>Middle Río Lerma subpopulation:</u>  on surveys by Köck et al. in 2017, it was found in several spring areas  within the ríos Laja, Turbio and Guanajuato drainages, but all of them  small or moderate. Being fragmented due to heavily polluted rivers  downstream. it is regarded Vulnerable. <br/><u>Río Verde subpopulation</u>:  It is still known from a few spring areas, dams and creeks in the  headwaters of the ríos San Juan de Los Lagos and Verde. Due to heavy  declines within the last decades, it is regarded Endangered<br/><u>Lower Río Lerma subppulation</u>: no collection sites of this subpopulatio are known, so it is regarded possibly Extinct.<u><br/></u><u>Laguna Yuriría subpopulation</u>: The species is no more mentioned from this lagoon (Estrada-Cortés, 2016), so it has to be regarded possibly Extinct. <br/><br/><em>Xenotoca</em> cf. <em>variata</em> (with an EOOmax of 2,200km² and AOOmax of 800km²):<br/><br/><u>Río Grande de Morelia subpopulation</u>: This to be described species occurs in the Lago Cuitzeo, the Presa Cointzio and several spring habitats close to the river or the lake (manantiales La Mintzita, Borbollon, San Cristobal). Due to sveral locations and different threat status, it is regarded Vulnerable. <em></em>",Decreasing,"The Jeweled Splitfin is a freshwater fish endemic to the Mexican federal states of San Luis Potosí, Querétaro, Michoacán, Jalisco, Aguascalientes, Guanajuato and Zacatecas.

Vouchers indicate that this species also populated the lower Rio Lerma basin including the <u>Río Duero </u>and the<u> Río Grande de Santiago/ Laguna Chapala</u> basin (where it still can be found in the <u>Lagos Los Negritos</u> ponds), but it seems to be completely extirpated from these areas except for the Lagos Los Negritos.

There is considerable variation in terms of both threats to the habitat and to the species across its distribution. Thus, particular subpopulations may be of concern especially as the taxonomy is re-evaluated.","Desert Iguana habitat most often consists of sandy arroyos or other open areas with loose soils, but sometimes the species occurs on nearby rocky hillsides (Norris 1953; Grismer 2002, 2004). In most of its range, Desert Iguanas are typically found in Creosote Bush desert with hummocks of loose sand and patches of firm ground with scattered rocks, whereas in southern Baja they occur in subtropical arid shrub habitats (Norris 1953, Stebbins 2003, Venegas-Barrera <em>et al</em>. 2008). These lizards seek shelter both from heat and predators in rodent burrows or rock crevices (Grismer 2002, Revell 2005), and they may climb into bushes (Stebbins 2003).<br/><br/>The Desert Iguana is generally active from April-September, with limited activity at other times of the year dependent on environmental temperature, with the exception of populations on Catalina Island that are active throughout the year (Grismer 2004, Revell 2005, Venegas-Barrera <em>et al</em>. 2008). No specific information on hibernation is available. Activity patterns also vary throughout the day; individuals tend to bask early in the morning and are more likely to enter burrows later in the day (Grismer 2004).<br/><br/>The mean home range size of Desert Iguanas varies greatly among individuals (201–4,244 m<sup>2</sup>), but also differs among sexes (M = 1,462 m<sup>2</sup>, F = 1,558 m<sup>2</sup>; Krekorian 1976). Conversely, there does not seem to be much sexual dimorphism in body size, including snout-vent length, head length, or head width (Dibble <em>et al</em>. 2008). Mean snout-vent length across the range is 115.43 mm, with a maximum of 148 mm (M. Packer <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Males in Palm Springs, CA, had a mean body mass of 70.0 g with a range from 48.4 to 92.0 g (Singleton and McGarland 2018).<br/><br/>The Desert Iguana reproduces annually across its range (Mayhew 1971, Pianka 1971). The average size at reproduction was found to be 120 mm (females) and 127 mm (males) snout-vent length (Mayhew 1971). Clutch size can range from 3–8 eggs (Norris 1953). Once laid, the length of egg incubation ranges from 45–80 days until hatch (Krekorian 1984), and hatchlings are at least 47 mm snout-vent length before day seven (Parker 1972).<br/><br/>Generally an herbivore, the majority of Desert Iguanas’ diet is made up of plants, with insects contributing little overall dietary volume (Dibble <em>et al</em>. 2008). Examples of food items include leaves, seeds, and Cardon Cactus fruit (island populations), as well as ants, termites, and beetles (Grismer 2004, Dibble <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Desert Iguanas demonstrate a wariness for predators including escape behaviour into bushes and burrows, which can vary depending on the ambient temperature and also the speed of predator approach (Cooper Jr. 2003). Common predators include both birds (Revell 2005, Carbajal-Marquez <em>et al</em>. 2012) and snake species (e.g., Sidewinder; Avila-Villegas <em>et al</em>. 2007).","In some areas, especially around the Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, suburban communities, habitat has been lost or degraded as a result of conversion to human uses (agriculture, road construction, and commercial, energy production, and residential development). Populations along busy highways and newly paved byways presumably have been reduced as a result of road mortality and destruction of burrows that desert iguanas build inside the dirt berms. These threats remain in a limited, although increasingly substantial, portion of the overall range. There are added concerns for island populations including climate change-induced severe drought and temperature extremes that are likely affecting populations adversely, as has been documented in other iguana species (<em>Sauromalus</em>) from the islands (Case 1982).","The Desert Iguana is represented in museums by hundreds of collection sites throughout its range in the United States and Mexico (e.g., see Hulse 1992). The total adult population size is unknown but probably exceeds 100,000 adults. This lizard is noted as very common in northeastern Baja California (Grismer 2002) and in similar Creosote Bush desert habitats in southeastern California, southern Nevada, and western Arizona. Since then, habitat conversion due to continued development throughout their range has led to localized declines in areas of human occupancy. Population size declines have occurred where habitats have been lost or degraded due to urbanization, particularly in the southwestern US and Baja. The species is present in several protected areas in the United States and México. Little quantitative information is available on population densities; however, it is known that density across the distribution is not uniform (C. Malone pers. obs.). One study calculated juvenile densities in Arizona, which fluctuated from 11/hectare in late spring to 20/hectare in fall (Parker 1972).",Unknown,"The Desert Iguana ranges widely in the southwestern United States, northwestern mainland Mexico, and the Baja Peninsula. Its range encompasses: southern Nevada; extreme southwestern Utah along the Virgin River in the vicinity of Beaver Dam Wash; northwest, central, and southern Arizona; southern California east of the Sierra Nevada and coast mountain ranges; southward into Mexico through northeastern Baja California, all of southern Baja California (excluding most of the Vizcaíno Desert), and western Sonora to northern Sinaloa. This lizard occurs on many islands in the Gulf of California and on Magdalena and Santa Margarita islands along the Pacific coast of Baja California, occurring most densely in sand habitats (Norris 1953, Hulse 1992, Grismer 2002, Stebbins 2003).

All these wetlands are interconnected through the Grand Canal, the oldest and longest canal in the world with a history of over 2,500 years. The Yangtze subpopulation therefore appears to have inhabited lowland lakes and rivers in the Yangtze coastal plain. Pritchard (2012), reviewing records of the species in Viet Nam, describes it as cryptic, fairly sedentary, inhabiting sluggish or still waters associated with major rivers, shuffled into the mud and detritus on the bottom, and eating almost anything organic. Wang <em>et al. </em>(2013) reviewed the habitat selection of <em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> in the upper Red River, China, and demonstrated that they were mainly recorded in river sections with sandbars and in particular at confluences of tributaries with the main river where the water was deeper. They seem to occur in deep sections of large rivers, in backwaters and in lakes. The two known live wild individuals in Viet Nam both live in semi-artificial lakes (dammed back with barrier structures).&#160;The captive <em>R. swinhoei </em>in China accepts animal matter like fish, various mammalian meats, chicken, crayfish, snails, salad and other plants, and also sadly junk food thrown into his pond by visitors&#160;(Kuchling <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). At least adults of the species are omnivorous. The female in China preferred to nest on open, sunny sand banks and avoided different soil and vegetation cover (Kuchling unpublished), but nothing is known of nest site selection in the wild. Nothing is also known on the biology and habitat selection of hatchlings and juveniles.<br/><br/>The Yangtze female was well over 90 years of age at the time of death and usually laid three, sometimes four, clutches per year of 55 to 65 (infertile) eggs each. This suggests a generation time of at least 100 years.","<p><em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> remains under extreme pressure from exploitation of adults and eggs for (subsistence) consumption and targeted capture attempts in recent years due to its increased value. In addition, it has been affected by habitat loss through conversion, drainage, fragmentation and pollution of wetlands and riparian habitats, and hydroelectric barrages and sand mining.</p>","<p>An adult male of the Yangtze population has been kept for decades at the Suzhou Zoo in China. A female in the same zoo died in April 2018 and had mated many times with the male without producing fertile eggs. A male of the Red River subpopulation inhabited for a long time Hoan Kiem Lake in downtown Hanoi, Viet Nam, but died in January 2016. Another individual of the Red River subpopulation of unknown sex inhabits Dong Mo Lake west of Hanoi (subsequently captured in October 2020 and confirmed to be a female; WCS 2020) and a further individual was recently confirmed by eDNA in Xuan Khanh Lake, not far from Hanoi and Dong Mo Lake (Asian Turtle Program Press Release 11th April 2018). Surveys of the Red River basin in both Yunnan and Viet Nam in recent years have hinted at the possible survival of one or more animals, at least until recent times, but had not documented confirmed additional living animals until the capture of a female in October 2020. While the species has declined substantially over recent historical times, extensive records were known from the Red River subpopulation in both China and Viet Nam from the 1960s until the 1990s (Pritchard 2012). The last records from the lower Yangtze River region date from the 1930s. The decline accelerated greatly with increased agricultural and industrial development since the 1980s, and assuming a generation time of 100 years, has probably declined by over 99% over the past two generations.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Historical records for <em>Rafetus swinhoei</em> exist from throughout the Red River basin of Yunnan and Viet Nam, as well as the coastal plains of northern Viet Nam. The species is also known from the lower Yangtze lowlands of eastern China. Based on late Pleistocene and Holocene fossils from Zhejiang and Taiwan Straits, speculatively it may historically have occurred in the Pearl River system and other drainages between northern Viet Nam and the Yangtze delta.<br/><br/>At the time of assessment, the current distribution in the wild was limited to two animals in reservoirs near Hanoi; the possibility remained of rediscovery in other northern Vietnamese wetlands. In October 2020, a female turtle was captured in a Dong Mo Lake near Hanoi and the genetic results confirmed it to be this species (WCS 2020).

In 1998 a <em>R. swinhoei </em>was rescued from a restaurant at the Chinese Red River and released (Wang <em>et al. </em>2013). In 2008 the known individual of Dong Mo Lake in Viet Nam was caught by a fisherman who offered it for sale to a restaurant, but it was bought back and rescued by the Asian Turtle Program. The last record of a <em>R. swinhoei</em> slaughtered by villagers for its meat is from about 2009 at the Chinese part of the Red River (Kuchling <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;In the 1970s and 1980s there was some trade of <em>R. swinhoei </em>from Viet Nam into China (Pritchard 2012), but overall international trade does not seem to have been a significant factor in the decline of the species. Since its recognition as a high-value species there is a risk that animals are targeted for trade.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p><em>Rafetus swinhoei </em>was listed in CITES Appendix II in 2013 and is a species that is Protected for Beneficial, Economic or Scientific Value under China’s Wild Animals Protection Law. It is fully protected under Vietnamese Decree 160 ND-CP 2013, and a conservation action plan for Viet Nam has been drafted, to be published in summer 2018.<br/><br/>The Asian Turtle Program is working with villagers and stakeholders to protect the two known wild individuals in Viet Nam.<br/><br/>The captive male and late female in China were subjects of an intensive captive breeding program, but all eggs produced were infertile.&#160;An examination of the male in 2015 revealed that he had lost the majority of his penis probably during a past fight with another male and is unable to inseminate the female with the remaining stump without seminal grooves. Artificial insemination was attempted several times but did not result in egg development (Kuchling and Shunqing 2015).<br/><br/>Intensive, targeted surveys are needed in the Red River paleo-drainage of northern Viet Nam and adjoining Lao PDR, and possibly in Yunnan and elsewhere.<br/><br/>Establishment of a secure facility in Viet Nam is a necessity, to transfer any discovered animals into to attempt their captive breeding. The discovery of a female in October 2020 and the potential that others may still survive provides hope for the future survival of this species.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
3150871,97246272,Gopherus agassizii,Critically Endangered,A2abce+4abce,2021,2020-10-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"A provisional Red List Assessment of the widespread Desert Tortoise,&#160;<em>Gopherus agassizii</em> (<em>sensu lato</em>), was performed at a Desert Tortoise Council workshop in 2010 and updated by the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group (TFTSG) in 2011, at which time the Mojave Desert subpopulation, now considered&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu stricto</em>) following taxonomic analysis and splitting into three separate species (<em>G. agassizii, G. morafkai, </em>and<em> G. evgoodei</em>), was assessed as Critically Endangered A2bce+A4bce based on population reduction (decreasing density), habit loss of over 80% over three generations (90 years), including past reductions and predicted future declines, as well as the effects of disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis). <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>) comprises tortoises in the most well-studied 30% of the larger range; this portion of the original range has seen the most human impacts and is where the largest past population losses had been documented.&#160;A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of <em>G. agassizii</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>) has demonstrated continued adult population and density declines of about 90% over three generations (two in the past and one ongoing) in four of the five <em>G. agassizii</em> recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units. As such, we reaffirm the prior assessment of the taxonomically restricted Mojave Desert Tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, as Critically Endangered, and add criterion “a” for direct population observations: CR A2abce+A4abce. The previously defined widespread species&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu lato</em>)&#160;was last assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1996; a separate assessment currently in progress by the TFTSG for the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai </em>(previously considered part of <em>G. agassizii</em>)&#160;has provisionally assessed that species as Vulnerable.","The life history of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is typical of long-lived chelonians and has been reviewed by Berry and Murphy (2019). Tortoises require 17–20 years to reach sexual maturity at a straight-line carapace length (CL) of 18 cm or more (Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, Medica <em>et al</em>. 2012). Variation in years is dependent on desert region, frequency of droughts, and quality of available forage. In the northern part of the geographic range, females smaller than 20.9 cm were not reproducing (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998).&#160; Maximum lifespan was estimated by Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) at 75 years, but few live beyond 50 yrs in the wild (Germano 1992). Generation time was estimated to be 20–32 years (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, USFWS 1994). Based on data from three desert regions, mean sizes of females ranges from 21.4 to 23.1 cm, whereas the mean sizes of males ranged from 24.3 to 24.9 cm; the largest desert tortoises on record, a male, reached 38.1 cm carapace length (Stebbins 2003), whereas a female was 37.4 cm, but these animals were exceptions (Berry and Murphy 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Mature females may lay clutches of one to 10 eggs in up to three clutches per year in spring and early summer; in some years, some females do not lay eggs (Rostal <em>et al</em>. 1994, Henen 1997, Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wallis <em>et al</em>. 1999, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual fecundity ranges from 0 to 16 eggs (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2015). Several factors may affect egg production: site, year, size of female, size and number of eggs, and available water and protein from precipitation and forage in the year preceding egg laying, as well as the year eggs are laid (Henen 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Incubation times for eggs range from 67 to 104 days (Burge 1977, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hatching success varies and appears to depend on year, location of the nest, and whether it is the first or second clutch. Eggs may be infertile or broken during laying (e.g., 12%; Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). Many nests are destroyed by predators before hatching and the loss of eggs (and nests) varies by year (Turner et al. 1987); they estimated an average loss of 37.1% of nests in a multi-year study. Hatching success in intact nests, undisturbed by predators, has been shown to vary from 73 to 100% (McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Rostal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bjurlin and Bissonette 2004, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises inhabit desert scrub habitats, including saltbush, creosote bush, Joshua Trees and Mojave yuccas, and microphyll woodlands with ironwood, palo verde, desert willow, and smoke trees (Berry and Murphy 2019). In the northeastern part of their geographic range, they occur in an ecotone between the Mojave and Great Basin deserts with sand sagebrush and junipers. Actual occurrences tend to be in valleys, alluvial fans, bajadas, and ephemeral stream channels, although tortoises can be found in low sand dunes and on steep slopes of mesas and cliffs (Berry and Murphy 2019).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises are herbivorous and selective in their choice of plant species (Jennings 1993, Oftedal 2002, Oftedal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jennings and Berry 2015). They primarily eat forbs when available. In years of abundant precipitation, they are selective feeders and prefer specific species of annuals and herbaceous perennials in the legume, mallow, borage, aster, four o’clock, and cactus families (as well as other families). Although they eat grasses, a diet solely of grasses is deficient in nutrients and is likely to inhibit growth and survival, especially in neonate, juveniles, and immature tortoises (Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The quality and quantity of preferred plant foods has diminished because of continuing invasion of non-native annual grasses and forbs and increased fire associated with the highly combustible&#160;non-native grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).&#160;<br/><br/>Annual survival and mortality of adults is dependent on sex, size of the tortoise, frequency and severity of droughts, numbers and types of anthropogenic uses, location, and decade of study. In a multi-year study in the eastern Mojave Desert, annual survivorship of juveniles increased with size, ranging from 0.767 when &lt;6.0 cm to 0.861 when 6.0 to 17.9 cm (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). When tortoises reach breeding age at an estimated 18.0 cm, survival rates were 0.87 to 0.944. Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported an annual survival of 0.883 for adults at Joshua Tree National Park. In a study in the Colorado Desert, Agha <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated adult survival at a wind-turbine energy site (0.96) and an adjacent area (0.92). At two sites in the eastern Mojave Desert, Longshore <em>et al</em>. (2003) reported annual survival of adults of 0.985 and 0.829, with the lower survival rate at a site affected by drought.<br/><br/>Woodbury and Hardy (1948) estimated that 1% of adults died per year in a population mostly comprised of adults. In the northeastern Mojave Desert, Turner <em>et al</em>. (1984) reported mortality rates of 18.4% in a year of drought and 4.4% in a normal year. In the western Mojave Desert, death rates were lowest at a protected Research Natural Area (2.8%/yr) and highest in critical habitat (20.4%/yr). At Joshua Tree National Park, the mortality rate was 11.7% (Freilich <em>et al.</em> 2000), and in Red Rock State Park, 67% (Berry et al. 2008). In a demographic study of tortoises at 21 sites in the central Mojave Desert, mortality rates of adults ranged from 1.9 to 95.2% (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) predicted an annual rate of population increase of <em>ca</em>. 2% in a model based on a tortoise subpopulation in the eastern Mojave Desert between 1977 and 1985. By 2000, this subpopulation had declined precipitously, apparently due to disease (see Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2002) estimated the recruitment rate of young tortoises into the adult subpopulation at 0.092 in a plot in Joshua Tree National Park. This number of tortoises on this plot was thought to be stable between 1991 and 1995, but later declined (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>&#160;faces&#160;multiple threats to individuals, populations, and habitat (for annotated bibliographies of reports and published papers, see Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980; Berry 1984; USFWS 1990, 1994, 2010, 2011; Grover and DeFalco 1995; Bury and Luckenbach 2002; von Senckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002; Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2011; Lovich and Ennen 2013a; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015; Berry and Murphy 2019). Recent articles document further examples of threats (Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b,c). Much of the information with numerous references are contained in Berry and Murphy (2019). Substantial tortoise habitat was already lost to cities, towns, settlements, agriculture, energy developments, and military bases in the 20th century, and continuing habitat loss and degradation, combined with high mortality rates in dwindling low-density populations due to disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis), road and off-road vehicle-induced mortality, subsidized predators (e.g., ravens), poaching for pets, and mortality from increasing droughts associated with climate change, are threatening most remaining populations of Desert Tortoises (summarized in Berry and Murphy 2019). The majority of desert tortoise populations are currently considered non-viable because of the low density of adults and their existence in isolated and fragmented pieces of habitat (Berry 1984, USFWS 2010, Allison and McLuckie 2018, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).&#160;<br/><br/>Many threats are cumulative in nature and interact synergistically with others. By rating them separately in the Standard Threats Classification Scheme below, the severity of threats and their negative impacts are not described in full measure. One of the limitations of the classification scheme for threats are the ratings for severity. Severity is associated with declines (or not) by percent over 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer. For species such as desert tortoises with long generation times (<em>ca</em>. 20–30 years), this may be 60 to 90 or more years. Here we provide a detailed and expanded Threats Classification Scheme for <em>G. agassizii</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Detailed Threats Classification Scheme<br/><br/></strong>Classification Level<br/><br/>&#160; a. Examples<br/>&#160; b. Timing and Scope<br/><br/>1.1 Housing &amp; urban areas, towns, settlements, ranches<br/>&#160; a. Desert cities, towns, settlements, scattered homes in rural areas, desert land entry, e.g., Inyokern, Ridgecrest, Red Mountain, Trona, Boron, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, Lucerne Valley, Ft. Irwin, Barstow, Daggett, Mountain Pass, Joshua Tree, Twentynine Palms, Vidal Junction, Ludlow, Amboy, Needles, Las Vegas, St. George, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, Parker, Blythe, El Centro,&#160;Stateline, Las Vegas, Mesquite, St. George.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, disappearance of tortoises and habitat; 20% of geographic range. Loss of habitat from widespread and rapidly growing and expanding cities, towns, and settlements associated with high levels of human population growth in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts and loss and degradation of adjacent habitat (Hughson 2009, U.S. Census Bureau 2010). In the northwest and southwest portions of the geographic range, tortoise populations are locally extinct, absent from valleys and fans and in low densities on military bases.<br/><br/>1.2 Commercial &amp; Industrial<br/>&#160; a. Airports and landing strips, military bases, solar and wind farms.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, loss of tortoises and habitat; 8% of geographic range. Development and use of multiple airports, landing strips, several large military bases with ground disturbing activities (military manoeuvres), and solar and wind farms (with associated transmission lines and roads)&#160;result in degradation and loss of substantial habitat in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts.<br/><br/>1.3 Residential &amp; commercial; golf courses, tourism, recreation<br/>&#160; a. Golf courses are associated with cities and towns that currently exist or are expanding within or near Desert Tortoise habitat (e.g., Las Vegas, Henderson). Vehicle-oriented recreation and visitation are very high in many parts of both deserts including what is now critical habitat, several State Parks and National Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, museums, and other points of interest.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Loss and degradation of habitat, illegal collecting of tortoises: 30%. The high levels of visitor use pose severe threats to <em>G. agassizii</em> throughout remaining habitat as well as in critical habitat. For example, at Lake Mead National Recreation, annual records of visitors from 1946 was &gt;1 million visitors per year; by 2018 more than 7.5 million visits occurred (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/"" style=""color: purple;"">https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/</a>). In parts of critical habitat in the western Mojave Desert, visitor use is very high, e.g., visits and visitor days recorded annually from 2008–2018 ranged from 55,874 to 94,474 visits and 26,218 to 90,445 visitor days per year (USBLM 2019). Visitor use, particularly vehicle-oriented use, is very difficult to control; a substantial portion occurs off-highway and designated trails.&#160;Off-road vehicle recreational uses are associated with higher rates of deaths from gunshots in tortoises occurring in areas with high visitor use days (Berry 1986, 2020a).<br/><br/>2.1.3 Agriculture: Agro-industry farming<br/>&#160; a. Farms for cotton, alfalfa, pistachio, goat-nut, and other crops and dry farming in parts of the geographic range (e.g., Fremont, Antelope, Indian Wells, Victor, Apple, Lucerne, Mojave River, Chuckwalla and Virgin River valleys, bordering the Colorado River).<br/>&#160; b. Severe, cleared land, local areas, often expansive, throughout the geographic range. Historic and ongoing. Habitat and tortoises lost, 10%. Farming began very early (late 1800s) and continues to the present. Farming has negatively affected the water table locally, causing subsidence and fissures to develop in at least one area (Berry 1984), as well as altering vegetation in the vicinity. Habitat cleared for farming generally is used for industrial purposes, e.g., solar or off-road vehicle recreation after abandonment. Both agricultural and industrial uses are associated with influx and proliferation of non-native plants onto adjacent, high quality desert tortoise habitat and protected areas.<br/><br/>2.3.2 and 2.3.3 Agriculture: livestock farming &amp; ranching<br/>&#160; a. Cattle ranching, sheep grazing and driveways, allotments, licenses, and leases (often on federal lands); growing herds of feral burros and expansion into critical habitat.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Moderate to severe, historic (from 1850s), ongoing; 80% of the geographic range affected. Grazing of livestock and use of driveways was widespread and often intensive throughout the geographic range until the Taylor Grazing Act in 1932. Livestock grazing was widespread after that time but managed as an important desert use (e.g., Berry 1984, USBLM 1980). In 1990, after the tortoise was listed as threatened, sheep grazing continued but was excluded from critical habitat. Cattle grazing continued throughout much of critical habitat and still occurs in an estimated 17% of critical habitat (USFWS 2010). Feral burros also graze in tortoise habitats and are encroaching into one critical habitat (USFWS 2010; Berry et al. 2020c). Livestock cause degradation and loss of habitat through development of piospheres, trampling, altering cover, composition of shrubs and forage plants available for tortoises to eat (Webb and Stielstra 1979, Fleischner 1994, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Abella 2008, Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016). The disturbances created by grazing contributes to growth and proliferation of non-native, fire-prone, invasive grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992).<br/><br/>3.1 Energy production &amp; mining: oil and gas<br/>&#160; a. Oil and gas, drilling and exploration.<br/>&#160; b. Medium severity, local areas, &lt;1% of geographic range. Exploratory drilling has occurred in tortoise habitat and has left degraded and cleared areas of &lt; 1-2 ha, with spoil piles, drilling waste, and trash from the drilling operations spread over the area. These sites became focal points for camping and vehicle-oriented recreation, enlarging over time (K.H. Berry pers. obs.).<br/><br/>3.2 Energy production &amp; mining: mining and quarrying<br/>&#160; a. Small and large mines, exploratory pits, bulldozed areas, shafts, and major mines; quarries.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation on a local or regional scale; 5%. Mining on small and large scales began in the late 1800s, killing tortoises and destroying habitat. Roads were constructed to access potential mining areas and districts (Mojave,&#160;Rand, Atolia, Goldstone, Calico, Mountain Pass). Tortoises fall into pits and shafts and were killed. Some mines cover 7.8 km<sup>2</sup> or more and their influence can expand beyond that. Gold mines are associated with spread of mercury and arsenic in soils and plants far beyond the source (e.g., &gt;12 km), transported by wind and water (Chaffee&#160;and Berry 2006; Kim <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014). Tortoises are negatively affected by these elemental toxicants with poor health; these toxicants were reported in livers, integument, lungs, etc.&#160;(Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, Selzer and Berry 2005, Foster <em>et a</em>l. 2009).<br/><br/>3.3 Energy production &amp; mining: renewable energy<br/>&#160; a. Windfarms, photovoltaic, solar fields; new utility and transmission lines, power poles and towers with adjacent roads accompany these developments.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, future. Severe degradation and loss locally over large areas, 5% over the geographic range. Windfarms occur in tortoise habitat, generally on slopes or on hills and small mountains. Solar panels have been constructed on abandoned agricultural fields or in low density or marginal habitat. However, some projects were built in prime habitat, causing loss of habitat and displacement of tortoises. Solar and wind energy is a growing industry with losses of &gt;106 km<sup>2 </sup>as of 2019 (Mark Massar, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>4.1 Transportation and service corridors: roads &amp; railroads<br/>&#160; a. Freeways, 2-lane highways, county gravel or dirt roads, and roads to points of interest; railroads (two major) and several spurs with associated dirt roads and tower lay-down areas for power towers and poles.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe loss and degradation of habitat. 5% throughout the geographic range. Roads were developed in the late 1800s and have proliferated and widened into freeways since that time. Several major freeways and state highways cross the geographic range. Importantly many more dirt roads exist to points of interest (e.g., mines, mining areas, water troughs and water sources, outlying rural areas, recreation areas). Tortoise populations are depleted on either side of highways and well-used roads for distances of &gt;4,000 m (von Seckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002). A very small portion of these roads and highways have tortoise-proof fencing.<br/><br/>4.2 Transportation &amp; service corridors: utility &amp; service lines<br/>&#160; a. Telephone and electric poles and lines; major transmission lines and corridors.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, moderate to severe. Telephone poles and electric poles and lines usually parallel major or minor paved and dirt roads and extend from towns and cities&#160;into remote areas to provide service to agricultural developments, mines, wind and solar farms and individual residences or small settlements. Electric transmission lines cross many parts of the geographic range, including critical habitat (critical habitat alone: 1,634 km of lines in corridors, total area of corridors, 1,743.5 km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2010).&#160; These corridors are accompanied by dirt roads and spurs to the towers. Often corridors contain several sets of towers and electrical lines. Utility lines also include ground disturbance from fibre optic cables, aqueducts, and gas lines, all of which disturb tortoise habitat. Utility poles and transmission lines have allowed for spread of predators (Common Raven, Red-tailed Hawk) into remote parts of the desert, because they make use of the towers and poles for perching and nesting, leading to increased predation on tortoises (Knight and Kawashima 1993, Anderson and Berry 2019).<br/><br/>4.4 Transportation and service corridors: flight paths or military use<p>&#160; a. Commercial, non-commercial, and Department of Defence flight paths.<br/>&#160; b. Numerous, ongoing. Flight paths are minor or no impact if not associated with release of ordnance (bombing ranges). The noise may have effects on wildlife, including tortoises (e.g., Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>5.1.1 Biological resource use: hunting &amp; trapping terrestrial animals: intentional use (species is the target)<br/>&#160; a. Illegal collecting of <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>for commercial sale, food, cultural purposes, and for international trade, etc.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Tortoises have been and continue to be collected for pets, food, tourism,&#160;commercial sale, and cultural purposes, although such collection has been unlawful since 1939 (Berry 1984, Berry <em>et al</em>. 1996, Berry and Murphy 2019, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.1 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: recreational activities<br/>&#160; a. Visits to State and National Parks and Preserves, National Recreation Areas, federal and state lands, private lands, and Open Recreation Use Areas (unrestricted vehicle play areas) by vehicle-oriented recreationists.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe impacts regionally and locally, especially in the western, central, and southern Mojave Desert and growing in the western Sonoran Desert; associated with proximity to cities, towns, and settlements. Formerly populated with Desert Tortoises, several intensively used areas are now severely degraded and have few if any tortoises (e.g., Bury and Luckenbach 2002, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014a, USFWS 2015, Berry and Murphy 2019). Vehicle-oriented visitation is exceptionally high, ranging from &gt;50,000 to 86,550 between 2008 and 2018 annually in some regions of the Mojave Desert (USBLM 2019). Other parts of the desert and critical habitat are also experiencing growing numbers of visitors. Deaths of desert tortoises from road kills and shooting is higher in areas with high levels of vehicle-oriented visitation (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.2 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: war, civil unrest &amp; military exercises<br/>&#160; a. World War II and subsequent. Military manoeuvres across substantial areas of habitat in the western Sonoran and eastern Mojave deserts to train troops using tanks and other vehicles for the war in North Africa. Since the 1960s, military manoeuvres with armoured vehicles in extensive areas in the western, southern, and central Mojave deserts; aerial bombing training in limited areas in the western Sonoran Desert.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Military manoeuvres in 1942 resulted in severely degraded habitat (compacted soils, damaged desert pavements, altered vegetation, including forage available for desert tortoises. Lands disturbed in 1942 have not recovered after 60 years (Prose 1985, 1986; Prose and Wilshire 2000). Similar disturbances have occurred and continue to occur in tortoise populations and habitat at military installations in the southern and central Mojave Desert. In the early 2000s, expansion of the Fort Irwin military installation in the central Mojave Desert caused loss and degradation of 760 km<sup>2</sup> of tortoise habitat and <em>ca</em>. 304 km<sup>2</sup> of the lost habitat was part of critical habitat (USFWS 2010, Berry and Murphy 2019). An estimated <em>ca</em>. 300 km<sup>2</sup> will be lost with additional, ongoing expansion of the same base. The western expansion of the Marine Corps base at 29 Palms caused hundreds of tortoises to be translocated and habitat lost in the southern Mojave Desert (USDD 2017).<br/><br/>6.3 Work and other activities: law enforcement, illegal immigrants, species research, vandalism<br/>&#160; a. Border patrol agents and illegal immigrants travel cross-country by foot and vehicle in tortoise habitat in the southern border range. Vandalism, specifically wanton shooting or killing of tortoises has affected some populations more than others, probably associated with higher visitor use and vehicle-oriented recreation.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, moderate severity. Border patrol agents travel north from the border into tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, to apprehend illegal immigrants. Vehicle travel can occur off dirt roads, widen existing roads, and create new disturbances. Shooting tortoises, running over them deliberately with vehicles, or otherwise killing them has been documented in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>7.1.1 Fires &amp; fire suppression<br/>&#160; a. Caused by lightning, car fires on highways or roads, arson.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, severe, with the severity dependent on the critical habitat unit or protected area. Mojave and Colorado Desert habitats did not evolve with fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Fires increased in numbers, frequency, and amounts burned with the invasion and proliferation of non-native grasses which are highly combustible (Berry and Murphy 2019). Fires have occurred throughout the geographic range and have burned significant amounts of critical and other protected habitats in the southern, central, eastern and northeastern Mojave Desert regions. Once habitat burns, it is likely to burn again with higher frequencies and with potentially increased biomass of non-native annual grasses. Tortoises die in these fires or are injured, but some survive (Berry and Murphy 2019). Loss of cover of shrubs and food supply for the tortoises is severe in most burned areas. When fires are very hot, the seed bed may be damaged or destroyed. The most severely burned protected habitat is in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve with &gt;30% burned as of summer 2020 (McLuckie <em>et al</em>. 2021); the Mojave National Preserve also experienced a major fire and loss or degradation of 7% of the critical habitat unit in summer 2020 (Darby <em>et al</em>. 2021). <br/><br/>7.2.8 Abstraction of ground water<br/>&#160; a. For agriculture, primarily, followed by urban and cities.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, long-term degradation of habitat adjacent to cities, towns, industrial and agricultural developments. Depletion of the ground water table causing subsidence and formation of fissures has occurred in at least one part of the western Mojave Desert and in the northeastern Mojave Desert in the Las Vegas Valley in what was once desert tortoise habitat (Berry 1984, Burbey 2002). In the western Mojave Desert, the water table was depleted by agricultural uses (cotton, alfalfa) and now with solar energy development; and by cities in the Las Vegas Valley by depleted associated aquifers. Other regions have and continue to experience depletion of the water table in areas with agriculture and desert cities, e.g., adjacent to the Mojave, Colorado, and Virgin rivers (Stamos <em>et al</em>. 2001). Water is sought from sources and regions outside desert tortoise habitat (e.g., the Colorado River) to support cities and towns, as well as agriculture, because existing water tables are insufficient to support them.<br/><br/>8.1.2 Invasive and other problematic species, genes &amp; diseases: Named species<br/>&#160; a.&#160;<em>Bromus madritensis </em>ssp<em>. rubens, B. tectorum, Schismus </em>spp<em>., Erodium cicutarium, Hirschfeldia incana, Brassica tournefortii.<br/></em>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation of the Mojave and western Sonoran ecosystems. Landscape conservation forecasting (Provencher <em>et al</em>. 2011) quantified the pervasive abundance of annual brome grasses that foster destructive wildfires of a size and intensity far greater than the fire regime with which Mojave Desert habitats developed over the past millennia.&#160;In addition to supporting fires, the non-native grasses compete with native forage species of forbs required by tortoises to grow, reproduce, and remain healthy. Non-native grasses and forbs dominate the ecosystem in biomass in both wet and dry years in many tortoise habitats (Brooks and Berry 2006, Berry 2014b). Non-native grasses are not nutritious plants for tortoises to eat and cause weight loss and can cause death in juveniles (Hazard <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The awns of <em>Bromus</em> also can injure tortoise mouths. The non-native <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em> and especially <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, introduced through agricultural development, also compete with native forage species, changing the composition of the native flora (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b). They are not eaten by tortoises and can be high in oxalates, potentially a source of oxalosis in tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>8.1.2 Diseases. Named species<br/>&#160; a. Infectious diseases: <em>Mycoplasma agassizii, M. testudineum, </em>Testudinid herpesvirus 2 (TeHV2); Non-infectious diseases: oxalosis, gout, starvation, dehydration.<br/>&#160; b. Infectious diseases: ongoing, severe in some areas. The two species of <em>Mycoplasma</em> are infectious pathogens. The first (<em>M. agassizii</em>) was discovered in wild populations in 1989 and the second (<em>M. testudineum</em>) a few years later (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2014). These pathogens are spread by contact between tortoises cause disease and death in some populations, and inhibit olfaction necessary for foraging (Jacobson and Berry 2012, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Mycoplasma agassizii</em> is common in captive desert tortoises, more so than in wild populations. Epidemiological studies indicate that the distribution of the two species differs, and that tortoises with antibody-positive tests for the diseases occur closer to human habitations rather than more distant (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mycoplasmosis has been implicated as a major contributor to a catastrophic die-off of tortoises at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2020b). It is also associated with declines in other parts of the geographic range (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160; Non-infectious diseases of known etiology include oxalosis, gout, and starvation and dehydration (Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Some individuals and populations have been negatively affected by these diseases.<br/><br/>8.2.2 Problematic Native Species<br/>&#160; a. The Common Raven (<em>Corvus corax)</em>, an uncommon to rare resident between the 1920s and 1940s in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts, is now an abundant predator in ecosystems where the Desert Tortoise lives.&#160;Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>) is another similar predator, and Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) can also be a hyper-predator.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe and negative effects on population structure; loss of juveniles and immature tortoises. Populations of the Common Raven have grown enormously, supported by subsidies of food, water, perch and nest sites available from humans (Boarman 1993, Boarman and Berry 1995). They have been able to access formerly remote parts of the desert by relying on settlements, road kills and trash along highways and roads, and utility poles and transmission lines for perching and nesting (Knight and Kawashima 1993). Common Ravens are very effective predators on hatchling, juvenile and immature tortoises, with dozens to hundreds of shells recorded beneath perch and nest sites. They are responsible for preventing recovery in many parts of the desert by depleting young tortoise cohorts in populations that can lead to local extinctions (Kristan and Boarman 2003). Red-tailed Hawks have expanded their use areas into remote parts of the desert ecosystems, using utility poles and towers as nest sites and juvenile tortoises for food (Anderson and Berry 2019). Similarly, Coyotes are subsidized predators found in increased numbers near cities, towns, and some military installations and at times have high predation rates on tortoises (Esque <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>8.4.2 Problematic Species/ Diseases: Named Species<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Several non-native species of tortoises and turtles carrying disease or potentially carrying disease have been released illegally into Desert Tortoise habitats, e.g., African Spurred Tortoise (<em>Centrochelys</em> <em>sulcata</em>; Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018) and Central Asian Steppe Tortoise (<em>Testudo horsfieldii</em>; Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe. Releases of tortoises, whether native or non-native are illegal in large parts of the geographic range. Nevertheless, introduced, non-native turtles and tortoises such as the African Spurred Tortoise and Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise have been found to carry new diseases that would negatively affect already declining <em>G. agassizii </em>populations (Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018). The African Spurred Tortoise can do damage to habitat and to the native tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, because of the large size and aggressive nature. One Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise was captured in the Central Mojave Desert with a new herpesvirus not previously described in <em>G. agassizii&#160;</em>(Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The concern is that this non-native tortoise may have transmitted the new herpesvirus to desert tortoises. New, non-native herpesviruses from other species and countries and continents are a threat to health in already declining <em>G. agassizii</em> populations.<br/><br/>8.5 Viral/Prion-induced Diseases<br/>&#160; a. Herpesviruses are implicated in illness and mortality in tortoises.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe if coupled with other stressors. Herpesviruses are a threat to health and survival of desert tortoises, especially those herpesviruses introduced from other, non-native species to the desert. Tortoises with clinical signs of the disease were among populations that severely declined between the 1990s and 2000s; herpesvirus may have contributed in some areas (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Testudinid herpesvirus 2 was first identified in captive tortoises, then confirmed in wild <em>G. agassizii</em> (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The estimated prevalence of this herpesvirus for captive and wild tortoises from the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts ranged from 15 to 56% (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>8.6 Diseases of Unknown Cause<br/>&#160; a. Shell diseases, i.e., cutaneous dyskeratosis, necrosis.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. A novel shell disease, cutaneous dyskeratosis and shell necrosis, was implicated in illness and deaths of Desert Tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1994; Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2001) and a decline of ca. 80% in a once-robust population. Other populations in critical habitats appear to be affected similarly. This is a metabolic disease with lesions of the shell and integument as outward manifestations. The causes are suspected to be toxicants (e.g., elemental toxicants and/or nutritional deficiencies). The disease is implicated in elevated death rates in adult tortoises in the western Sonoran Desert and eastern Mojave Desert (Berry and Medica 1995, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>9.2.2 Industrial &amp; military effluents<br/>&#160; a. Seepage from mining.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, unremediated regionally. There are links between some diseases in tortoises and toxicants from mining and other similar developments. Tortoises dying of upper respiratory tract disease caused by <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp. in the western Mojave Desert in close proximity to a mining district had high levels of mercury in livers compared to tortoises without the disease (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991). Ill tortoises with high levels of arsenic occurred in an area mining district with high levels of mercury and arsenic (Selzer and Berry 2005). Waste from the mines was transported by wind and water to distances of 15 km (Chaffee and Berry 2006; Kim et al. 2012, 2014). Mines in other tortoise habitat in different desert regions have yet to be examined.</p><p>9.4 Garbage &amp; Solid Waste<br/>&#160; a. Trash is a threat to tortoises because they can consume it or become entangled.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, low to moderate. Consumption of trash can lead to illness and death (Donoghue 2006, Walde <em>et al</em>. 2007). Balloons and other trash are common throughout the desert and most abundant near human habitations, along roads, and recreation use areas (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, 2014a; Keith <em>et al</em>. 2008). Trash attracts predators—Common Ravens, Coyotes, and other canids—thus creating an additional risk to tortoises.<br/><br/>9.5 Air-borne Pollutants<br/>&#160; a. Pollutants such as atmospheric nitrogen and increases in CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the growth of invasive grasses and thus fire.<br/>&#160; b. Atmospheric nitrogen from urban or other areas is transported to deserts and tortoise habitat, and deposited on soils, thus enhancing growth of non-native grasses and plants prone to fire (Brooks 2003, Rao and Allen 2010).<br/><br/>11.1 Habitat Shifting &amp; Alteration<br/>&#160; a. Desertification; degradation of vegetation, soils, and topography<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Throughout the geographic range, most, if not all, tortoise habitats have received (and continue to receive) one or more anthropogenic uses and activities resulting in compacted or eroded soils and alteration of the natural structure and composition of annual and perennial vegetation (e.g., Lei 2009). Long-lived shrubs and native annual wildflowers and grasses have been replaced in part with short-lived colonizers (shrubs, non-native, fire-prone grasses) typical of disturbed areas. These changes have brought fewer places to dig burrows and a reduced supply of nutritious plants to eat (Brooks and Berry 2006, Webb and Wilshire 1983). In some areas, the rich diversity of shrubs and annual plants have been replaced by a few shrub species and the annuals replaced with primarily non-native annual species (Brooks and Berry 2006).<br/><br/>11.2 Droughts<br/>&#160; a. Desert Tortoises require water from precipitation and a diverse diet of native annuals to grow, reproduce and survive.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, increasingly severe with reduced survival throughout the geographic range, often associated with hyper-predation by coyotes. Although the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts are typified by droughts often lasting more than a year, tortoises have adaptations to cope. However, tortoises die of starvation and dehydration during prolonged droughts (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2002, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003, Longshore <em>et al</em>. 2003, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014). Juveniles are especially vulnerable. With climate change and warming, droughts, including megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, are predicted to occur in coming years (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2017, Steiger <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>11.3 Temperature Extremes<br/>&#160; a. Tortoises are able to withstand the extremes of temperature experienced in the desert; however, increases in warm temperatures coupled with drying and changes in precipitation patterns present high risks to the species.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing and a growing issue, with climate change having negative impacts throughout the geographic range. Tortoises cope with the extremes of summer and winter temperatures (and lack of water, see 11.2) by using deep burrows and restricting above-ground activities and reproduction during drought. As temperatures rise with the rise in CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, tortoises will need to find habitats where deeper burrows can be excavated. At the higher temperatures, the spring season for foraging on ephemeral annuals and egg laying is likely to be shortened, reducing the time for eating, growing, and egg production. Sex of tortoises is determined by temperature of incubation in nests, with females produced at the higher temperatures and males at the lower temperatures. Eggs laid in nest that will experience the high temperatures of summer may be predominantly female, and if temperatures are excessive, may not be viable. Although the species could survive at higher (and cooler) elevations, the habitat in mountain ranges will be more limited, steep, rocky, with exposed bedrock in places with inadequate forage.<br/><br/>12.1 Other Threats<br/>&#160; a. Climate Change.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, see 11.2 and 11.3. Change in timing and amounts of precipitation coupled with increasing temperatures are likely to have profound negative effects on the species, further reducing available habitat (e.g., Barrows 2011). Profound changes are predicted to cause deterioration in composition, structure, diversity and biomass of trees and shrubs (Munson et al. 2016) that provide shade and cover to the tortoises. Barrows (2011) predicted that tortoises may survive if they move from the western Colorado Desert to higher elevations.&#160; However, the long-lived tortoises have strong fidelity to existing home ranges.</p>","Population estimates and trends have previously been difficult to obtain with certainty for large segments of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> populations due to their patchy distribution, difficulty of detection, and associated statistical weaknesses of population estimates. Population data have been variously documented or reviewed by Woodbury and Hardy (1948), Hardy (1976), Berry (1984, 1986, 1989), Bury and Corn (1995),&#160;Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Berry and Murphy (2019). A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;by Allison and McLuckie (2018) has demonstrated continued adult population declines in four of the five&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units and low densities in nearly all subpopulations near the minimum required to remain viable (3.9 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>Between the 1930s and early 2000s, estimates of density and trends in populations were based on demographic data, habitat condition, and anthropogenic threats from both long- and short-term study plots of varying sizes, as well as reports by government agency personnel and expert observers (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948; Hardy 1976; Berry 1984, 1989). The study plots were limited in number and did not represent the entirety of subpopulations across the geographic range (e.g., Berry 1984). The subpopulation on the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah, was federally listed as threatened in 1980 (USFWS 1980). A petition submitted by the Desert Tortoise Council in 1984 to list all wild populations in the United States was denied; the USFWS determined that listing of U.S. populations was warranted but precluded because of other higher priorities (USFWS&#160;<span style="""">1985</span>). In 1989 and 1990, the State of California and USFWS listed the tortoise as threatened (USFWS <span style="""">1989,&#160;1990;</span> California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2016). The appearance of upper respiratory tract disease and rapidly declining populations in the western Mojave and a major decline in tortoises in parts of the western Sonoran (Colorado Desert, California) associated with appearance of shell disease were additional threats to the many causes of declines (USFWS 1990, 1994, and references therein). Reflecting its concern over these declines, USFWS (1994:3) stated that: “The most serious problem facing the remaining desert tortoise population is the cumulative load of human and disease-related mortality accompanied by habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. Virtually every extant desert tortoise subpopulation has been affected by one or more of these factors.” As a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994) also designated federal critical habitat units for desert tortoises at that time.&#160;In October 2020, the California Fish and Wildlife Commission accepted a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to up-list wild desert tortoises from threatened to endangered status; California has the largest subpopulation and geographic range of the species. The petition is currently under consideration by the agency with a response estimated in 2021.<br/><br/>To better measure trends in densities of adult populations in the threatened subpopulations, the Recovery Team proposed development of a landscape scale program (USFWS 1994). At the same time, the Recovery Team also noted the importance of study plot data, because more population attributes were provided than density of adults. After experimenting with different techniques, the USFWS decided to use distance sampling and initiated a formal, range-wide program for estimating densities of adult populations in critical habitat units (USFWS 2015, and references therein).<br/><br/>In the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994), population size, viability, and sizes of protected areas were discussed. Assuming the minimum density of adults in a population was “approximately 10 adults per square mile” (equivalent to 3.9 adults/km<sup>2</sup>), the target size for protected areas (then called Desert Wildlife Management Areas) was approximately 1,000 mi<sup>2</sup> (ca. 2,590 km<sup>2</sup>). This would ensure that even at such low densities and assuming half of such large areas might support no or few tortoises, each protected area would support enough adults for a genetically minimum viable population. The Recovery Team recommended six Recovery units with 12 different populations. The updated Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011) is based on the same number of populations but configured into five revised Recovery units with 17 different monitored subpopulations.<br/><br/>Most demographic data from study plots collected from the 1930s on the Beaver Dam Slope and between 1979–1980 in California and Nevada during the spring season indicated counts of 5–64 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Berry and Murphy 2019). In describing trends between 1978 and 1990 in California, the USFWS summarized data from 10 study plots in the Mojave and Colorado deserts and reported a highly significant downward trend (USFWS 1994). Additional data for the period showed some populations with low but potentially stable densities in Nevada (Berry and Medica 1995). A review of population status (Tracy <em>et al</em>. 2004) considered updated information from the permanent study plots in California and found that population declines in the western part of the range in California continued and declines were perhaps beginning in the eastern part of the California range.<br/><br/>The current population trends are based on landscape-level assessment using distance sampling for the 11-year period between 2004 and 2014 (USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). The sampling represented all five recovery units with 16 subpopulations in critical habitat units of from 115 to 3,763 km<sup>2</sup> described in the original Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994). Joshua Tree National Park is treated as a protected area and monitored as a 17th subpopulation although not designated as critical habitat. Consistent downward trends have continued in four of the five recovery units, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 11 years. Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014; the exceptions were adult densities in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) and the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (10.2/km<sup>2</sup>) (Berry et al. 2014, 2020). Unfortunately, in July 2020, a significant part of the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve burned and tortoises were found injured and dead. The Red Cliffs subpopulation declined from 2005 wildfires and with the recent 2020 fires, there will likely be further depression in densities. The six subpopulations with increasing densities had 2.7 to 6.4 adults/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2014. However, most of the 17 populations were near or below the 3.9 /km<sup>2</sup>&#160;density of adults considered as a minimum for viable populations (USFWS 1994, 2015).",Decreasing,"The Desert Tortoise was previously considered to be a single wide-ranging species, <em>Gopherus agassizii</em>, inhabiting the Mojave and Sonoran Desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico from southern California and Arizona through Sonora and into northern Sinaloa (Stebbins 1966, 2003; Iverson 1992). The species was found to be polytypic by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2011), who split the morphologically and genetically distinct Sonoran Desert populations as <em>Gopherus morafkai</em>, the Sonoran Desert Tortoise. Further analysis demonstrated that <em>G. morafkai</em> was also polytypic and split further to separate and describe the Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise further to the south as <em>Gopherus evgoodei</em> (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Geographically restricted <em>G. agassizii</em>, the Mojave or Agassiz’s Desert Tortoise, is endemic to the United States, inhabiting southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and extreme northwestern Arizona west and north of the Colorado River (TTWG 2017, Berry and Murphy 2019). The Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai</em>, occurs in both the United States and Mexico, inhabiting Arizona south and east of the Colorado River, Sonora (including Isla Tiburón), and extreme northern Sinaloa (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2011, TTWG 2017). The Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise, <em>G. evgoodei</em>, is endemic to Mexico and occurs in southern Sonora, northern Sinaloa, and extreme southwestern Chihuahua (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016, TTWG 2017).<br/><br/>Within its geographic range, <em>G. agassizii</em> occurs in the Mojave Desert, the western Sonoran or Colorado Desert, the ecotone of the Mojave with the Great Basin Desert, and ecotones with vegetation types typical of higher elevations on the lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada, Transverse, Peninsular and desert mountain ranges (USFWS 1994). McLuckie <em>et al</em>. (1999) identified a subpopulation of <em>G. agassizii</em> east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of northwestern Arizona in which morphometric and mtDNA characteristics of the majority of the subpopulation were typically Mojavean; however, elements typical of tortoises in the Sonoran Desert were also evident. Edwards <em>et al.</em> (2015), using new genetic techniques, examined this and other nearby tortoise subpopulations, and identified hybrids (F2) in three mountain ranges near the Colorado River in Arizona. The two <em>Gopherus</em> species come in contact in limited places where Mojave Desert habitats meet Sonoran Desert habitats. The two species likely maintain largely independent taxonomic identities due to ecological niche partitioning (Inman <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species has been recorded at elevations of up to&#160;1,570 m asl (Rautenstrauch and O’Farrell 1998); however, tortoises may be found in unusual places, often transported by humans or other animals (e.g., the type specimen of <em>Xerobates lepidocephalus</em>&#160;[Ottley and Velázquez-Solis 1989] from southern Baja California, Mexico, is actually an introduced <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>[Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2011]).","Commercial take or use of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is prohibited by law, and few animals have been documented in (illegal) trade in recent decades. The evaluation of conservation status, conservation and monitoring actions for the species have generated significant financial investments in the species, supporting a range of local and visiting livelihoods. The approximate cost to develop and implement the 25-year recovery program for the Mojave Desert Tortoise was USD 100 million (USGAO 2002, Ernst and Lovich 2009, USFWS 2011, Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thirty years have passed since the federal listing of&#160; <em>G. agassizii</em> as threatened in 1989–1990, declines of breeding adults continue, and many tasks to reduce deaths, described first in 1994 (USFWS 1994), remain to be implemented (see also USFWS 2011, Reports from the Recovery Implementation Teams). If fully implemented, the recommended actions could exceed 159 million USD plus additional costs that could not be estimated in the 2011 Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011). As one of the keystone species of the Mojave Desert, <em>G. agassizii</em> plays an unquantified but substantial role in generating tourism income to regional protected areas (see Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/"">https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/</a>).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation Measures taken:<br/></strong>The first legal conservation measures for <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> came from the State of California in 1939 (California Department of Fish and Game Code 1939–1981).&#160;Additional protective regulations followed until <em>G. agassizii </em>was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 1989 (California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife 2016). Federal legislation to protect <em>G. agassizii</em> first occurred in 1980 and was restricted to the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah (USFWS 1980). In 1989–1990, <em>G. agassizii</em> was federally listed as threatened (USDI&#160;<span style="""">1990&#160;</span>and references therein). The only population of <em>G. agassizii</em> that is not protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is in the northwest corner of Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery efforts have been underway since 1990. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1994) published the first Recovery Plan in 1994, coupled with designations of critical habitat units by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994); this was followed by a revised Recovery Plan in 2011 (USFWS 2011), and regional Recovery Implementation Teams established in 2012. These teams are chaired by an employee of the USFWS Desert Tortoise Recovery Office, and are composed of federal, state, and county employees from the range of the desert tortoise, including representatives from local and national conservation and other stakeholder organizations. <br/><br/>The species is included in CITES Appendix II as part of Testudinidae spp., requiring that any commercial international trade be documented not to be detrimental to the survival of wild populations. CITES Trade records generally show very low levels of international exports of live animals; the vast majority of live traded Desert Tortoises are personal pets moving in-country with their owners, and many of the records in fact concern seizures of illegally transported specimens (CITES UNEP-WCMC trade database).<br/><br/>Conservation and recovery efforts began in the early 1970s, long before efforts of the federal actions by the USFWS in 1989–90. The Desert Tortoise Council formed in 1974-75 out of an interim recovery effort involving the four Southwestern states. This non-profit corporation was and continues to be dedicated to preserving representative populations of desert tortoises; educating the public; holding annual introductory workshops; and annual symposia to bring together representatives from government agencies, academia, and the public to learn and discuss important topics aimed at recovery of tortoise populations. The Desert Tortoise Council was instrumental in providing critical materials for federal and state listings of the species. The Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, Inc., was formed in 1974 to establish protected areas for <em>G. agassizii</em>. This non-profit organization is a land trust and mitigation bank, a source of education, and research. They were instrumental in establishing the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area and increasing its size.<br/><br/>Two preserves or protected areas exist with moderately high degrees of protection. One is the 100 km<sup>2</sup> (and increasing) Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area, which was formally designated by the U.S. Congress in 1980. It is fenced, with no vehicle access, livestock grazing, mining, or surface disturbances other than a few limited natural trails and a kiosk. The Natural Area is for wild tortoises only and populations are allowed to fluctuate naturally with no augmentation. Population density of adults throughout the Natural Area in 2011-12 was 10.2/km<sup>2</sup> (Berry et al. 2014a). The second preserve is Red Cliffs Desert Reserve in Utah (251 km<sup>2</sup>). The Red Cliffs National Conservation Area provides additional protection for federal lands within the Reserve. Several paved roads, fenced and unfenced, run through the Reserve and recreation occurs throughout (e.g., hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking).&#160;The next and lower level of protection could be described as occurring within National Parks, State Parks, and National Recreation Areas such as Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, Mojave National Preserve, Red Rock Canyon, Anza-Borrego, and Red Rocks State Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and the Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area. These parks and recreation areas have very high visitor use, unfenced paved roads, and some illegal collecting and release of captive tortoises of one or more species. <br/><br/>Twelve critical habitat units, the basis for Tortoise Conservation Areas (term defined in USFWS 2011), were designated by the USFWS (1994), and have far less protection than either the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area or the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and are subject to multiple land uses that fragment and degrade habitat and create vulnerabilities and risks to the tortoises (e.g., invasive non-native grasses and other non-native species; highways; roads; utility poles, towers, and electrical transmission lines; gas lines and fibreoptic cables; recreational vehicle use; shooting; domestic and feral dogs; cattle grazing and feral burros; mining; military installations; fire that causes degradation of habitat).<br/><br/>Seventeen monitored subpopulations in the 12 critical habitat units are contained within five recovery units which cover a total of 25,678 km<sup>2</sup>. The following information for each recovery unit and the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas reports area (km<sup>2</sup>), and density of breeding adults per km<sup>2</sup> in 2014. Western Mojave Recovery Unit: Fremont-Kramer (2,347 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Ord-Rodman (852 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Superior-Cronese (3,094 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Colorado Desert Recovery Unit: Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range (713 km<sup>2</sup>, 7.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Chuckwalla (2,818 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.3/km<sup>2</sup>), Chemehuevi (3,763 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Fenner (1,782 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Joshua Tree (1,152 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Pinto Mountain (508 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Piute Valley (927 km<sup>2</sup>, 5.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Eastern Mojave Recovery Unit: El Dorado Valley (999 km<sup>2</sup>, 1.5/km<sup>2</sup>), Ivanpah Valley (2,447 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit: Beaver Dam Slope (750 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Coyote Spring (960 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.0/km<sup>2</sup>), Gold Butte (1,607 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Mormon Mesa (844 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit: Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (115 km<sup>2</sup>, 15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2015; Allison and McLuckie 2018). The overall decline in tortoise populations in critical habitats (Tortoise Conservation Areas) between 2004 and 2014 was 32.2% (USFWS 2015). Four of the five recovery units are in a state of decline, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 10 years (USFWS 2015). Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014 (USFWS 2015).<br/><br/>Extensive research has been published in peer-reviewed journals on many aspects of natural history, general ecology, physiological ecology, reproduction, health and diseases, population attributes, causes of death, movements and home range, predators, head-starting, translocation, and many other topics, making <em>G. agassizii</em> likely the most well-researched non-marine turtle species (Lovich and Ennen 2013b). Over 400 journal articles were published as of 2018, most between 1990 and 2018, as well as hundreds of reports (see three annotated bibliographies covering almost 160 years: Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980, Grover and DeFalco 1995, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016). Some information has been integrated into recovery programs, but many of the recovery measures recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) have not been implemented as of 2020.<br/><br/>Economic relevance: The approximate cost of USD 100 million to develop and implement the first and second Recovery Plans is significant within the regulatory, scientific and local economic sectors involved and much remains to be implemented (USFWS 1994, 2011; Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Measures needed:<br/></strong>The USFWS (1994) published recommended regulations for the areas that were designated as critical habitat. They described activities to be prohibited (e.g., all vehicle activity off designated roads; all competitive and organized recreational vehicle events on designated roads; habitat destructive military manoeuvres, clearing for agriculture, landfills and other surface disturbances; domestic livestock grazing, grazing by feral burros and horses; vegetation harvest; collection of biological specimens or vegetation harvest except by permit; dumping and littering; and deposition of captive or displace desert tortoises except under authorized translocation research projects; uncontrolled dogs out of vehicles; discharge of firearms except for hunting of game between September and February. There were many other recommended management actions but few of these recommendations were adopted when critical habitat units were officially described (USFWS 1994), and others have only been partially implemented by 2020.&#160;There were also recommendations for monitoring and research. In the second recovery plan, the USFWS (2011) identified and ranked (Darst <em>et al.</em> 2013) priority actions for recovering the Desert Tortoise and established regional Recovery Implementation Teams to implement these recovery actions. These Recovery Implementation Teams identify local, regional, and range-wide actions by submitting proposals to team members for discussion and prioritization. Ultimately the proposals are submitted to range-wide Management Oversight Groups composed of state, federal, and county government agencies for review, discussion, and potential sources of funding. Some projects are successfully funded and implemented, while many recommended in 1994 remain unfulfilled.<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Conservation Actions Needed, we provide the following notes:<br/></strong>1.1. Land/water protection -&gt; Site/area protection<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Better protection of Critical habitats could ensure that populations of tortoises become stable and/or increase. Examples of protective measures included in recovery measures for the tortoise are exclusion fencing and culverts along highways and roads; reduction in populations of hyper-predators such as the Common Ravens; control and removal of newly introduced and previously existing non-native plants; and control of recreational vehicle use.<br/><br/>2.1. Land/water management -&gt; Site/area management<br/>&#160; &#160; a. The first recovery plan identified site-specific or critical habitat-specific measures to ensure protection of habitat and reduction of deaths of tortoises from anthropogenic sources (USFWS 1994). Most of these recommendations are still relevant. The Recovery Implementation Teams have provided recommendations similar to those in the first recovery plan. Many of these measures remain to be implemented. For example, in the State of California where most desert tortoise habitat and populations occur, acquisition of private land would be beneficial, because a substantial portion of habitat is in multiple private ownership. Both the USFWS and State of California recommend that developers of tortoise habitat acquire replacement habitat for habitat lost to development, and such actions have been occurring for ~20 years. Another topic and critical area that would benefit from protection is the population and hybrid zone with <em>G. morafkai</em> east of the Colorado River in Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). This small population is not protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>2.2. Land/water management -&gt; Invasive/problematic species control<br/>&#160; a. Non-native grasses (e.g., <em>Schismus arabicus</em>, <em>S. barbatus</em>, <em>Bromus tectorum</em>, <em>B. madritensis rubens</em>) and forbs (e.g., <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em>) present serious and severe problems to tortoises because tortoises are selective in the choice of forage (Jennings and Berry 2015). The non-native annuals contribute to changes in forage availability, habitat structure, and increases in fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). These non-native species thrive under disturbance and spread via roads, livestock, military maneuvers, and disturbances created by recreational vehicle use off-road (e.g., D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006). The grasses are highly combustible and fire-prone in wildlands that did not evolve with short-term fire cycles (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). The grasses also compete with native annuals used as forage by the tortoises, and the species of grasses contain little nutrition, require water to metabolize, cause weight loss in the tortoises, and can become embedded in the jaws (Medica and Eckert 2007; Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similarly, <em>Brassica tournefortii</em> competes with native species used for forage and often occurs in dense stands, inhibiting movements of tortoises (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).<br/><br/>3.2. Species management -&gt; Species recovery<br/>&#160; a. Species management and recovery are guided by the Recovery Plan and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On-the-ground management is by the administering agency, e.g., U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Department of Defense, States (for state land), and private owners. That being said, much can be done by implementing actions recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) and by restoring degraded habitat (e.g., Abella and Berry 2016); controlling recreation vehicle use off-road and reducing fragmentation of habitat; limiting spread of invasive, non-native grasses and forbs; controlling hyper-predation in common ravens (USFWS 2008)&#160;and coyotes; preventing dogs and dog packs from running loose in the desert; and acquiring habitat.<br/><br/>4.3. Education &amp; awareness -&gt; Awareness &amp; communications<br/>&#160; a. See Conservation Actions in Place. Expansion of on-going programs to prevent take or shooting in the wild and release of captive tortoises of several species.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Research Needed, we provide the following notes:</strong></p>While research on some topics is desirable, more is known about <em>G. agassizii </em>than most other reptiles (Lovich and Ennen 2013b, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016 and references therein). Instead, implementation of previously identified actions to protect populations and habitat is more critical, specifically actions that will reduce deaths and loss or degradation of habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>1.1. Research -&gt; Taxonomy<br/>&#160; a. Genetic relationships between and within populations: human-mediated translocations of tortoises have occurred for decades, some authorized, some not (see Murphy et al. 2007). One recent question is the source of tortoises in Anza Borrego Desert State Park in the Colorado Desert of California. One might expect that the source would be tortoises occurring in the Colorado Desert, but instead tortoises have genotypes typical of the southwestern Mojave Desert population (Manning and Edwards 2019). More information on nearby tortoises (e.g. Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2020) occurring on the east-facing slopes of the Peninsular Range north of the Park may shed light on whether this is a naturally occurring population or a source that came from human-mediated translocations.<br/>&#160; b. Translocation of thousands of tortoises has occurred in the last &gt;20 years. Yet the only information available as to whether these translocated tortoises have been assimilated into the recipient or existing resident populations is research by Mulder <em>et al.</em> (2017) on assimilation of translocated males into the population of resident tortoises. Much more needs to be done on following males and females over a 10- to 20-year period to determine if and when adult males are assimilated into resident populations.<br/><br/>1.2. Research -&gt; Population size, distribution &amp; trends<br/>&#160; a. More information on current population attributes such as size-age class structure, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, sex ratios of adult tortoises, and causes and contributors to death is highly desirable. Landscape sampling undertaken and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Desert Tortoise Recovery Office has provided valuable region-wide information on adult densities but not on other essential population attributes (i.e., Allison and McLuckie 2018). Resurvey of long-term, mark-recapture tortoise plots has been spotty for the past 20 years while support has increased for line-distance sampling representatively and on a landscape scale (see USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). Nonetheless, it is clear (USFWS 2011) that species recovery cannot be assumed based on patterns of adult counts alone, and active work to describe vital rates across the range will be an important part of assuring tortoise populations reflect healthy population dynamics or determining regional and size-specific recovery needs.<br/><br/>1.3. Research -&gt; Life history &amp; ecology<br/>&#160; a. More information is needed on survival of neonate, juvenile, and immature size classes (first 12 to 15 years of life) and causes of mortality in the wild. Frequent input of new data on causes of and contributors to mortality for all size classes is essential for improving management of the species and for achieving upward trends.<br/><br/>1.5. Research -&gt; Threats<br/>&#160; a. The USFWS developed a model to identify major threats to the species (Darst <em>et al</em>. 2013); the information in this model is based on published research only, and not on the hundreds of reports and manuscripts available in Annual Reports to the USFWS on research permits. The model is outdated and needs major revisions to more accurately reflect available information and more recent priorities. In addition, support could be provided to speed up publication of important research projects that will lead to more protective management actions.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>3.1. Monitoring -&gt; Population trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on population attributes in critical habitat, near highways, and in critical habitat near urban areas.<br/><br/>3.4. Monitoring -&gt; Habitat trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on wildfires, non-native plants, seed beds, and recovery of preferred forage plants.<br/><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Some subpopulations had completely disappeared from overexploitation (Gomti) and some subpopulations remaining fairly strong, with population declines in Uttar Pradesh estimated at 30% overall (Participants Indian Turtle Red List Workshop Sept. 2005). By 2011, this pattern was considered to have become even more extreme, with a few healthy subpopulations remaining in small areas, but widespread disappearance elsewhere, as indicated by the inability of field surveys to find animals and the collapse of the trade (Participants Red List Workshop Singapore 2011).<br/><br/><em>Hardella</em> was considered common in all major rivers in Bangladesh up to the 1990s (Rashid and Swingland 1997), but subpopulations appear to have subsequently collapsed through over-exploitation so that by 2011 the species was considered critically endangered in the country (S.

However, the potential for geothermal exploitation of the source waters for the springs feeding Soldier Meadows must be regarded as a potential long-term threat (G. L. Vinyard, www.desertfishes.org). The primary current threat is the potential for introduction of competing or predaceous non-native fish species (and parasites associated with non-native fishes).<br/><br/>The BLM's 2004 Final Multiple Use Decision (MUD) for the Soldier Meadows allotment and the 2003 FWS Biological Opinion on the MUD contain measures that are expected to eliminate potential threats from livestock grazing and wild horse use. These measures include fencing of the Desert Dace habitat and provisions for additional inventory and monitoring actions of the species and critical habitat. A plan is also being developed that would reduce the level of potential impacts to Desert Dace from recreation use in the area. This plan would emphasize the sensitivity of the area, direct camping and vehicle use away from the Desert Dace habitats, provide educational and interpretation opportunities, and increase habitat monitoring in the area.

In 1994, the area occupied by this species was less 26 km² and the population was <em>ca</em> 1,000–1,200 individuals. Current population is estimated at <em>ca</em> 1,000 individuals. Population reduction is expected to continue, based on a continuing decline in its area of occupancy and extent of occurrence, as a result of the current high rate of habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due to unsustainable exploitation of forest, woodland, and bushland by people. A future population reduction exceeding 80% over three generations (33 years) is predicted, given the rate of decline in forest cover levels reached in recent years. This is especially likely if the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR) is officially annulled, an action now being considered by national authorities. The entire population lies in a politically insecure area over which there is a low level of conservation activity, and much unplanned, unregulated, and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources.</p>","<em>Cercocebus galeritus </em>is restricted to flood-plain forest, riverine gallery forest, and the adjacent woodland and bushland (Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013). Abundance is highly correlated with the spatial characteristics of the forests (Wahungu <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is a semi-terrestrial monkey that can travel up to 1 km through non-forested habitat between forest patches (Wieczkowski 2010). Mean group size is <em>ca </em>27 individuals (range: 6–62; Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013).<em> Cercocebus galeritus </em>is frugivorous and forages predominantly on the ground and up to 2 m above the ground (Homewood 1978). It feeds on seeds, fruits, stems, leaves, insects and fungi (Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013).","<em>Cercocebus galeritus </em>has declined as a result of several causes including: (a) drastic changes in vegetation due to dam construction, irrigation projects and water diversion, which affect both the water table and the frequency and severity of flooding which, in turn, affect the extent and quality of this species’ forest habitat; (b) forest clearance for agriculture; (c) fires that destroy forests; (d) habitat degradation due to livestock and (e) the unsustainable collection of wood and other forest products; (f) selective felling of fig trees for canoes; (g) exploitation of one of the species’ top food plants,<em> Phoenix reclinata</em>; and (h) corruption, inter-ethnic violence and insecurity. There is also percution of <em>C. galeritus </em>as a crop pest and this is expected to increase as natural foods become less available due to habitat loss (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Mbora 2000, de Jong and Butynski 2012, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013, Butynski and Hamerlynck 2016, Butynski and de Jong 2019). Because all remaining forests inhabited by<em> C. galeritus </em>are small and seriously threatened, the long-term survival of the species is in question.<br/><br/>There has been considerable alteration of river flow volume and the flood cycle by five hydroelectric power dams up-river (Butynski 1995). A sixth dam, the High Grand Falls Dam, is under construction (Hamerlynck <em>et al.</em> 2012; Butynski and Hamerlynck 2016). The High Grand Falls Dam, the second largest dam in Africa, will be accompanied by large-scale irrigation schemes and water transfer to the ‘Lamu Port and Lamu Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor’. The establishment of this dam is expected to have additional negative impacts on the forests of the Lower Tana River and, therefore, on<em> C. galeritus.<br/></em><em></em><br/>One special concern is the rapidly growing human population in the region. Another is the possible annulment of the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR; 169 km²), which the High Court of Kenya ordered in January 2007. According to the Kenya Wildlife Act 2013, Section 37, change of boundaries or revocation of a National Reserve can only be published by the Cabinet Secretary and approved by Parliament. Change or revocation can only be recommended if they do not endanger any species or critical habitat. As such, it seems unlikely that annulment will occur despite the court ruling in 2007.<em><br/></em><br/><em></em><em></em>About 56% of<em> C. galeritus </em>occur in TRPNR. Even with the continued existence of the TRPNR the long-term survival of<em> C. galeritus </em>is not certain as the high level of insecurity and inadequate law enforcement in the region is expected to continue, as is the growth in the human population (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Mbora 2000, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, Butynski and de Jong 2019).","<em></em>  <p><em>Cercocebus galeritus</em> is often relatively common where present (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013). In 1994, population density was&#160;<em>ca</em>&#160;0.45 individuals per ha of occupied forest habitat (Butynski and Mwangi 1994).

Competition with exotic guppies, <em>Poecilia reticulata</em>, eliminated the Thousand Creek Spring population (Williams and Bond 1983, Eleanor Gaines and Carrie Carreno pers. comm. 1998).

Population size is relatively large and may be more or less stable (within normal range of fluctuation).","The sole habitat consists of a clear, shallow (less than 1 meter deep), 4 ha, alkaline lake (Borax Lake) fed by thermal springs, outflow of the lake, and a pond (Lower Borax Lake) fed by the outflow. Precipitation of minerals from the water over thousands of years has raised the level of the lake approximately 30 feet above the desert playa, isolating the fish from the surrounding watershed.<br/><br/>The springs flowing into the lake have temperatures of about 35-40 °C (95-104 F). The chub prefers water of 29-30 °C (84-86 F); temperatures above 34 °C (93 F) are potentially lethal. The chubs live in those portions of the lake and in the wetlands at the lake's outflow where temperatures are suitable. At temperatures above 30 °C, fishes form loose schools around algae-coated carbonate nodules.<br/><br/>Chubs are fairly evenly distributed throughout the lake, though there is a tendency toward avoidance of shallow water.","The thermal waters feeding Borax Lake face a long-term threat from geothermal energy development. The small area of available habitat makes the species vulnerable to decreases in water level. Proposals to drill wells near the lake prompted an emergency listing of this species as endangered in 1980. Protection afforded by the Endangered Species Act has greatly curtailed exploratory drilling for geothermal energy development by creation of a zone of no surface disturbance around the most sensitive habitats. The Nature Conservancy, a private conservation organization, purchased a 65-hectare parcel of private land including Borax Lake in 1993. An area of 260 hectares has been designated as critical habitat by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; this affords additional protection from actions by federal agencies. The Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-399) has withdrawn geothermal and mineral development rights from the Borax Lake area. Source: USFWS (2009).<br/><br/>Other threats include modification of the fragile lake shorelines, which easily diverts water away from the lake, and overgrazing by livestock. The perched nature of the lake and its salt-encrusted shoreline render it highly susceptible to damage from off-road vehicle use and human visitation. The area is currently fenced to exclude livestock (USFWS 2009).<br/><br/>Additional threats include the potential for the introduction of nonnative species, which received only minor attention in the 1987 recovery plan.<br/><br/>A recently discovered nematode parasite may or may not be a problem (D.

However, a close monitoring of populations should be enforced to verify the stability of its populations.","The species normally roosts in large colonies (thousands or hundred of bats) in cooler portions of hot caves (Rodríguez-Durán and Soto-Centeno 2003). Under natural conditions, the brown flower bat roosts in the cooler hot-chamber foyers (Rodríguez-Durán 2009). It begins foraging later than many other bats (Gannon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Its diet typically contains some combination of insects, nectar, and fruit. In a detailed survey, 75% of the individuals consumed at least some insect remains, 76% had fed on nectar, 85% had eaten fruit, and about half the bats had consumed all three dietary items during their most recent foraging period (Soto-Centeno 2004). Seeds found in fecal pellets indicate that it often feeds on the fruit of Panama berry, elder, and turkey berry, whereas pollen samples obtained from the fur suggest that this bat also visits flowers of banana, guava, and wild tamarind for nectar (Gannon <em>et al</em>. 2005). It has a litter size of one and probably gives birth just once each year in spring. On Puerto Rico, pregnant females can be recorded from February through June, and lactating females from May through September (Gannon <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In the Neotropics, caves are under particular threat from increasing numbers of visitors who damage or modify the structure of the caves by mining for construction material or through extraction of guano for fertilizer (Mancina <em>et al</em>. 2007).

Its habitat has declined and is projected to  continue declining due to continuing threats from the loss of older  trees upon which the species depends and habitat loss and degradation  resulting from war in the region. Further, the two populations, one in  Crete and one in Libya, are likely to be highly isolated as this bat has  a small home range radius of <em>ca </em>3-4 km.","In Libya, the species appears to be restricted to Mediterranean coastal  habitats and has been recorded in Mediterranean forest, shrubland,  mosaics of shrubland and agricultural land (including pastures and  fields) (Aulagnier and Benda 2013, Aulagnier and Palmeirim 2008). It is  found in valleys or ravines with flowing water in the wet season and  also highlands (Aulagnier and Benda 2013).

In  shrublands, they are only found roosting in rock crevices or buildings.  The biggest known colony (<em>ca</em> 15 individuals) was located in a house  roof, under the tiles. Radiotracking showed that Quercus forest stands  and old tree cultivations are largely preferred for foraging, while open  areas, young Cypress stands and Mediterranean maquis are avoided.  Although it has been found roosting inside villages, they are used as  foraging grounds only if they maintain a high number of old trees. On  Crete, lactating females were trapped in late June and flying young were  recorded in early July, placing births in June.","Approximately half of this bat's global distribution is in a war zone.  How this may affect this species is unknown. On Crete, it roosts in  buildings and other man-made structures are threatened by demolition,  renovation works etc. Roosts in trees are threatened by logging for  firewood, expansion of cultivations and replacement of old olive trees,  residential and commercial development and fire. Foraging sites are  degrading due to similar reasons plus overgrazing.

A critical decline is suspected in Ukraine and European Russia (Vlaschenko <em>et al</em>. 2010 and 2016). Although there are no precise figures on population decline it seems reasonable to list this species as Vulnerable given what is currently known about the threats, the population numbers and the range. It qualifies as VU under criteria A4c and C2a(i).</p>","The Giant Noctule (<em>Nyctalus lasiopterus</em>) forages over mixed and deciduous forest and wooded river valleys (the latter especially on migration). It is highly dependent on mature forest: the species needs a number (27-39) of old trees (Popa-Lisseanu <em>et al</em>. 2008) to support a colony, hence any tree removal is a threat. It is largely insectivorous, feeding mostly on Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, but is also reported to take many small passerines in the southern part of the range during migration. During the bird migration seasons, passerines are likely to form a major part of the diet. Faeces collected during these times are composed 90% of feathers (Smirnov and Vekhnik 2013) During these times, 70% of faeces collected contain feathers (Ibáñez <em>et al</em>. 2001). &#160;Tracking the species using radar in Spain it is now known that this bat flies up to several hundred metres presumably to catch migratory birds. <br/><br/>In summer it roosts in hollow trees and bat-boxes, and occasionally in buildings. Trees and rock crevices may also be used as hibernacula in winter. It sometimes uses similar habitats to the other species such as <em>N. noctula</em>. Nursery colonies are usually relatively small (up to 35 females). Females give birth to a single pup per litter. It is considered to be migratory in the north-east of its range, but there is very little data, although a high density of only males has been found in northern Croatia (M. Mazija pers. Comm. 2016). Vagrants have been recorded well outside the normal range (Hutterer <em>et al</em>. 2005). Some areas in the western part of the range appear to be occupied exclusively by males, while others have both sexes according to capture results (Ibáñez <em>et al</em>. 2009).

In Cádiz (Southern Spain) it is estimated that a hundred Giant Noctules are killed each year by wind turbines (Ibáñez and Sánchez-Navarro, submitted), and more individuals have been found in other regions such as Soria and Navarra (Alcalde pers. comm. 2015). Exceptionally, all pups were found dead in 2005 at one of the two largest colonies in Spain (located in a city park). The cause of these deaths was not known (Juste pers. comm. 2006).

22085511,18751,Pteropus poliocephalus,Vulnerable,A2ace+4ac,2021,2021-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Grey-headed Flying Fox is assessed as Vulnerable under criteria A2ace and A4ac because, although the  population is relatively large (exceeding 10,000  mature individuals) and it has a large extent of occurrence (&gt;  20,000 km²), a continuing population decline is inferred to be  more than 30–35% over the last three generations (21 years, GL = 7  years; Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). A decline is also expected to  exceed 30% over the period encompassing the past 1 and at least two future generations (2014–2035).<br/><br/>The decline in population is inferred from  substantial loss and degradation of foraging habitat due to fire and  clearing, mass mortalities associated with extreme heat and food  shortages, and mortality from electrocution on power lines, and  entanglement in barbed wire and fruit tree netting. In particular,  extreme weather conditions in 2019-20 saw tens of thousands of  individuals die from food shortages and extreme heat events, and  unprecedented megafires affected 33.7% of the species’ total habitat  whereby 41.7% of the species' critical ‘winter’ foraging resources were  lost to high severity fires.<br/>The rate of decline is expected to  increase over at least the future two generations due to the increasing  frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events such as  heat events, droughts, floods and fires, along with changes in the  production of nectar, pollen and fleshy fruits in native vegetation,  largely unregulated land clearing associated with urban expansion,  agriculture intensification and human population growth, and increased  exposure of the species to anthropogenic threats in urban environments.  The capacity of the species to recover from increased mortality caused  by frequent or persistent threats is hampered by their low reproductive  rate, and low population growth rate even under optimal conditions.","The Grey-Headed Flying Fox is found in subtropical moist forest, open  forest, closed and open woodlands, Melaleuca swamps, Banksia woodlands,  mangroves, commercial fruit plantations (Hall and Richards 2000), and  increasingly in urban landscapes (e.g., Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021, Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  diet consists of nectar, pollen and fruits of a wide range of species,  most commonly native trees in the families Myrtaceae, Moraceae,  Proteaceae and a small number of species from other families. (Eby 1998,  Hall and Richards 2000, Eby and Law 2008, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em>  2009). The primary native food sources are the nectar and pollen of  <em>Eucalyptus</em>, <em>Corymbia</em>, <em>Angophora</em>, <em>Banksia</em>, <em>Melaleuca</em> species, and fleshy  rainforest fruits (Eby and Law 2008, Eby 1991); and they are known to  consume leaves, bark, and invertebrates (Clulow and Blundell 2011, Smith  <em>et al.</em> 2020, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em> 2009). They also forage  in agricultural areas, including orchards, and in introduced vegetation  in urban areas (McDonald-Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  majority of native diet plants have regular seasonal flowering  phenologies, but do not flower every year (Eby and Law 2008).  Grey-headed flying foxes experience seasonal food bottlenecks during  winter and spring when few diet plants are productive and the  distribution of native foraging habitat is limited (Eby and Law 2008).  Vegetation communities that contain plants that flower in winter and  early spring are of particular importance to the species during critical  periods in the reproductive cycle and have been identified as habitat  critical to survival (Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999, Eby and Law 2008, DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox lacks biological adaptations such as torpor to  withstand food shortages, instead individuals are thought to move in  response to changes in local food abundance (DAWE 2021). It is a highly  mobile species with individuals estimated to travel up to  2,500 km annually within a network of roosts located across southeastern  Australia (Eby 1991, Tidemann and Nelson 2004, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). On a nightly basis, individual bats may forage as far as 50 km  from their roost. However, mean foraging distances are between 6 and 11  km, with foraging distances shorter in urban than in non-urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021). There are few areas within the range where  nectar and other food sources are available continuously, except perhaps  in urban areas. While many flying-foxes feed in urban areas and urban  roosts may be permanently occupied, a proportion of the individuals  within these roosts move regularly between urban and other more natural  settings (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>It roosts by day colonially in  canopy vegetation and many roosts have a long history of use (Lunney and  Moon 1997). Individuals move nomadically throughout the species' range  within a network of roosts, and change roosts frequently (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Some roosts may temporarily contain &gt;100,000 individuals,  often coinciding with periodic flowering of preferred tree species (Eby  1991, Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;regularly  cohabits roosts with the black flying fox (<em>P. alecto</em>) and Little Red Flying Fox (<em>P. scapulatus</em>) with which it is partially sympatric (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021), and rarely with the Spectacled Flying Fox (<em>P. conspicillatus</em>) in the north of its range (Parsons <em>et al.</em>  2010). Of the 310 known camps in regular use, almost 75% are shared  with other species and only 25% are occupied exclusively by the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Timmiss <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The majority of camps (58.7%) are located in urban areas (Timmiss <em>et al.</em>  2021). From 1998 to 2019, the number of active roost sites increased by  approximately 120% and average population size at camps declined, with  94% of new roosts formed in urban areas (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  The pattern of increase in roost numbers has been stepped rather than  continuous, in association with periods of food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em>  submitted). The drivers of increasing urbanisation of the species are  unclear. Increased temporal stability (Markus and Hall 2004,  McDonald‐Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Parry‐Jones and Augee 2001, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006) and availability (Markus and Hall 2004, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em>  2006) of food resources from urban plantings may be responsible for the  recently observed increased presence of flying-foxes of urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021), however, broadscale reductions in feeding  opportunities in native habitats may also play a role (Parry-Jones and  Augee 2001, van der Ree <em>et al.</em> 2006, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014, P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  the roosts, males establish ‘mating territories’ that are actively  maintained by aggression, which is especially evident during the mating  season (March-May, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993; Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995; Eby 1995; Nelson 1965; Welbergen 2010, 2011). Males mate repeatedly  with the same female during a mating session and can have multiple  mating sessions with the same female over the course of several days  (Welbergen 2005). Males, but not females, accumulate body mass prior to  establishing their territories and can lose more than 20 percent of  their mass during the mating season (Welbergen 2011).&#160;&#160; <br/>The most likely time of conception is April (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995). Pregnancy in <em>P. poliocephalus</em> is seasonal, lasts for approximately 27 weeks (Martin <em>et al.</em>  1987) and the majority of females give birth to a single young annually  between late September and early November, although small numbers of  females give birth outside this time (Justin Welbergen pers. comm.).  Lactation lasts approximately 5–6 months (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1996), with the majority of young being weaned by the start of the mating season in March (Welbergen 2011).<br/><br/>Twins  are rare and there are no observations of twins surviving to weaning  (Peggy Eby pers. comm.). Sexual maturity is reached in the second year  (females) or third year (males) after birth (Welbergen 2010), and  generation length is estimated to be between 6 and 8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Divljan pers. comm).","Grey-Headed Flying Foxes are exposed to significant threats from  increasingly rapid human-induced environmental change, particularly loss  of foraging habitat and climate change impacts (DAWE 2021). They are  also impacted by increasing levels of conflict with humans at urban  roosts (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021). Key threats often act concurrently  and their impacts on population size are exacerbated by the species’ low  reproductive output, limiting its capacity to recover from impacts  (McIlwee and Martin 2002). Threats are predicted to increase in  frequency and severity in coming decades and, as a result, rates of  decline are expected to increase (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The  species is dependent on continuous access to flowering and fruiting food  plants sourced from widespread areas of native vegetation. Reduction in  food availability from loss and degradation of native habitat and  impacts of climate change, particularly drought and fires, is a key  threat (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, DAWE 2021). Incremental clearing  of critical winter/spring foraging habitat for urban expansion and  agriculture intensification is largely unregulated and is ongoing in  many regions. For example, loss of critical winter habitat was  associated with a collapse in winter influxes of nomadic animals into  far southeast Queensland from 1996 to 2018 (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>Climate-driven  food shortages affect the species throughout its range and are  associated with population-wide increases in mortality (assessed from  rates of intake by wildlife rehabilitation organizations) and reductions  in pre-weaning reproductive success (DAWE 2021, Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted, Mo <em>et al.</em>  2021). Food shortages were recorded every 3 years on average from 1998  to 2020 (range 1-4 years) and were associated with absence or very low  intensity of flowering in native forests (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  Food shortage impacts are generally global across the range of the  species and pre-weaning reproductive success assessed over 23 years  (1998 to 2021) and averaged across roosts in New South Wales was 56% in  food shortage years relative to 89% in non-food shortage years (P. Eby  unpublished data). This represents only a partial assessment of impact,  as adult female mortality was not considered in the denominators. Roosts  affected by the impact of extreme heat were not included in the data.  Repeated reductions in reproduction may reduce the capacity of the  species to recover from decline.<br/><br/>Extreme heat events, whereby  ambient temperatures exceed 42°, are known to cause mass mortality of  flying-foxes at landscape scales, and this has become a prominent  conservation management issue in Australia. Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  (2008) reported that between 1994 and 2008, &gt;30,000 Australian  flying-foxes, of which 24,500 were <em>P. poliocephalus</em>, had died during 19  separate extreme heat events. Between 2008 and 2019 a further 131.00  flying foxes died in several such events, including &gt;40,000 <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals (Welbergen 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  unpublished). During the 2019-20 summer, 72,000 flying foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events, with <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals comprising the majority of the mortality  estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The recorded deaths are likely  substantial underestimates of the true mortality as many roosts are not  inspected following events and where inspected mortality is often  underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.). Adult  females and dependent young are disproportionately susceptible to  hyperthermia, which negatively affects recruitment and the effective  breeding population limiting the species’ capacity for recovery  (Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Wildfires have also recently gained  significance as threats to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox. During the  extreme Austral 2019–20 summer, unprecedented bushfires affected an  estimated 5.8 Mha of temperate broadleaf forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning 33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7%  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires  (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts  of the 2019-2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both  the short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire. At present, there are insufficient data available to  estimate the impact on the <em>P. poliocephalus </em>population or predict its  trajectory of post-fire recovery.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme  heat events and associated droughts and wildfires are already readily  observable in southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to  escalate in frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021,  Herold <em>et al.</em> 2021). As such, the already substantial die-offs  from food shortages and extreme heat, and habitat loss from wildfires  are anticipated to continue to gain significance as threats to the  species.<br/><br/>The recent urbanisation of roosts exposes the species to  several threats. Conflict between people and Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;is  an ongoing problem that may cause loss or degradation of roosting  habitat and reduce community support for conservation initiatives (DAWE  2021). Flying-foxes are commonly perceived to be an annoyance, or  disease risk due to the noise and smell they emit and camps close to  human settlements are regularly subject to attempts to exclude the bats,  or clear vegetation in or around roosts to manipulate fine-scale  roosting positions (DAWE 2021, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Other threats include entanglement in fruit tree netting or  barbed wire fencing, electrocution on power lines, and vehicle  collisions. In a study of 532 Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;admitted to  emergency care in Victoria, Scheelings and Frith (2015) found  anthropogenic factors caused the majority (63.7%) of admissions, with  entanglement in fruit tree netting the most common cause (36.8%)  followed by entanglement in barbed wire fencing (12.4%). Roosts once  isolated from humans have become embedded in urban areas due to  increasing urban expansion in coastal New South Wales and Queensland  (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Grey-Headed Flying Foxes may cause damage to fruit  crops in both commercial and backyard orchards, and lethal control  methods were commonly used in the past, including electrocution and  shooting (DAWE 2021). Historically culling was a major cause of  mortality (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, there have been  efforts to reduce the number of flying-foxes killed by orchardists  through Government subsidised netting programs, and overall, the impact  of this threat has declined. Queensland still issues permits to cull up  to 1,280 individuals per year (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Interspecific competition  with the black flying fox (<em>Pteropus alecto</em>) may also be a threat to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b). Although there is no evidence of interspecific competition, the  black flying fox has been expanding both in range and abundance in the  northern parts of the Grey-Headed Flying Fox’s range (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a).<br/>Apart from culling by orchardists, all other threats are likely to continue or increase in severity and impact into the future.","This species forms a single, extremely mobile, interbreeding population distributed over a vast area (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;was considered abundant and estimated to number  in the many millions in the early 20th century (Ratcliffe 1931).  However, distribution-wide autumn population counts, based on counts of  individuals at known camps across the species range, varied between  320,000 and 674,000 (mean of 450,714) between 1989 and 2005 (Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). Subsequently a national program of largely synchronous quarterly  population estimates was established in November 2012 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015), and its autumn population counts varied between 522,000 and  663,000 (mean 570.900) over the period 2013-2019 (NFFMP, 2021). However,  counts from the periods 1989-2005 and 2013-2019 are not directly  comparable because of the differences in the methods used and  uncertainty about the survey coverage of the extent of the population  (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition, distribution-wide counts  lack precision due to the unknown proportion of individuals at unsampled  camps, and inconsistencies in sampling effort and counting methods used  among individual roost sites (DAWE 2021, Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015). Due to limited precision, the time taken to reach 80%  statistical power in detecting trends in the recent distribution-wide  counts has been modelled to be ~13.5 years, or until 2027 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2012). However, recent work suggests that the main method used for  counting individuals in roosts is much less precise than was assumed in  the modelling (McCarty <em>et al.</em> submitted). While efforts are currently underway to improve the reliability of count estimates (McCarthy <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, McCarthy <em>et al.</em>  submitted), until precision of the distribution-wide counts is improved  and better defined, it is not possible to establish meaningful trends  using current timeframes of population monitoring.<br/><br/>During the austral  spring and summer of 2019–2020, <em>P. poliocephalus </em>was exposed to a  sequence of circumstances associated with prolonged drought and extreme  heat, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021), near reproductive failure and the burning of over a third of its habitat (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/> <br/>At  this time, the species experienced an extended and intense food  shortage across a broad area of northern New South Wales and  southeastern Queensland, resulting in a large but unquantified number of  flying-fox deaths, possibly in the tens of thousands based on anecdotal  reports from wildlife carers (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). Pre-weaning reproduction at that time fell to 6% from a 21-year average of 74% (P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  addition, in the summer of 2019–2020, 72,000 flying-foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events throughout  eastern and southeastern Australia, with <em>P. poliocephalus</em> comprising the  majority of the mortality estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The  recorded deaths are likely substantial underestimates of the true  mortality as many roosts are not inspected following events and where  inspected mortality is often underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Furthermore,  in the summer of 2019–20, unprecedented bushfires affected an estimated  5.8 million hectares of forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning  33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7% of the species'  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires (Baranowski  <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts of the  2019–2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both the  short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat events and  associated droughts and wildfires are already readily observable in  southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to escalate in  frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021, Herold <em>et al.</em>  2021). In conjunction with other ongoing causes of decline that  contributed to the species’ previous listing as Vulnerable under  criteria A2ace, these extreme events are anticipated to amount to a  decline in mature individuals exceeding 30% over the period <em>ca</em> 2014–2035, equivalent to the previous one and future two generations under criteria  A4.",Decreasing,"The geographic range of the species has altered in the past 20 years as documented by range-wide monitoring (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2012), satellite telemetry studies (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020), a systematic search of field records (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b) and public reporting. While latitudinal range boundaries have remained generally stable (Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b), there has been a distinct inland expansion. As of 2021 the  range spans the coastal lowlands, tablelands, and slopes of eastern  Australia, from Finch Hatton near Mackay (Queensland) in the north to  Melbourne, Geelong (Victoria) in the south (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b, Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014) and inland to Port Augusta in South Australia, Cooma in the Snowy  Mountains of New South Wales (New South Wales), and areas of central  and southern New South Wales and Victoria including Dubbo, Wagga Wagga  and Albury (New South Wales), Numurkah and Bendigo (Victoria). There  have also been vagrant sightings outside of this range, including  occasional sightings in Tasmania and Bass Strait islands (Atlas of  Living Australia 2021, DAWE 2021). Sightings in Tasmania and islands in  Bass Strait are associated with periods of acute food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  great majority of observations and camps of this species are from the  coastal lowlands and slopes of south eastern Australia below altitudes  of about 200 m (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data).  However, known roosts vary in elevation from sea level to 800 m (Cooma),  and occasionally vagrant individuals have been reported from altitudes  up to 1,600 m in the New South Wales and Victorian high country (M.  Pennay pers. comm., Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data). Along the  southern periphery of its range, the species has increased in abundance  in urban areas including Canberra (Australian Capital Territory),  Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo (Victoria), and Adelaide (South  Australia) (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The species is typically  found from sea level to 800 m asl, with vagrants being documented up to  1,600 m asl.","The species is not known to be hunted, used, or traded.",Terrestrial,"This species is known to use a broad range of areas reserved for  conservation, which make up 12.6% of the area surrounding known camps,  however, only 5.2% of the camps occur within conservation areas (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Given the species' reliance on dispersed food  resources, conservation areas are unlikely to protect sufficient habitat  for the species.<br/><br/>A range of management actions and research to  assist conservation of <em>P. poliocephalus</em> into the future has been  identified in the National Recovery Plan for the species (DAWE 2021).  They include: identify, protect and increase roosting habitat and native  foraging habitat that is critical to survival, define and improve  precision in current population monitoring to determine reliable trends  in population size, build community capacity to coexist with flying  foxes and improve management of conflict at roosts in urban areas,  reduce the impact of electrocution on power lines, and entanglement in  netting and on barbed wire, significantly reduce levels of harm in  commercial fruit crops, support research that will improve conservation  and management, develop and apply ameliorative care procedures to  minimise deaths during extreme heat days, and management of fire (DAWE  2021).<br/><br/>In recent years, governments have funded and administered a  number of programs of subsidies to improve conservation outcomes for <em>P.  poliocephalus</em>. Plans of Management for several roosts have been  developed by land managers in consultation with affected stakeholders  (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012). The plans set out programs for managing  contentious roosts under various conditions, and can serve as effective  mechanisms for both reducing conflict and educating the public about the  conservation and management challenges that face <em>P. poliocephalus</em>.  Government subsidies in New South Wales have enabled commercial  orchardists to install full exclusion netting to protect their crops  from flying fox damage in advance of a halt to licenced culling on  crops.

Despite the likelihood  the species has undergone substantial local declines in regions where  wind turbines are widespread these areas are limited in relation to the  species total range and as an overall population it is currently  unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a  threatened category.","This species is known from a wide variety of habitats, including areas  disturbed by fire, forestry and parklands in urban areas. It typically  flies well above the canopy, studies using helium balloons and radar  found it was the most common species recorded at 100 metres above ground  level and it may fly up to at least 2 kilometres above the surface (D.  Mills and M. Pennay pers. comm.). It has also been recorded flying long  distances offshore (Cawthen 2013). It roosts in hollows of very large  trees, building ceilings, and similar habitats typically switching  roosts every 10 days (Rhodes 2007). The species exhibits a strong social  network structure with all individuals over a very large area  (&gt;200km2) connected through a communal central hub roost (Rhodes  2007). All bats spend time at the central hub roost, which may have up  to 300 individuals within it at a time (Rhodes 2007). At other times  bats that share the central hub roost form smaller social groups of 10  -20 bats that roost in ‘satellite roosts’ up to 15km from the central  hub roost (Rhodes 2007). Maternity colonies can consist of several  hundred animals (Rhodes and Richards 2008). Females give birth to a  single young. Generation length is likely to be at least five years (N.  McKenzie pers. comm.). Some parts of the population may move northwards  in the southern winter (Bullen and McKenzie 2005).","This species is highly susceptible to collision with wind turbines,  presumably because its preferred foraging height overlaps with the  elevation of wind turbine rotors. It was the first bat species recorded  to be killed by wind turbines (Hall and Richards 1972), and it is the  most commonly recorded bat species in monitoring of fatalities at  windfarms (M. Pennay pers. comm.). It is possible that local populations  are seriously impacted by wind farm developments given the high rates  of mortality and low rates of reproduction, particularly in high wind  areas where multiple wind farms operate. These localised impacts are  unlikely to cause sufficient decline in the species overall population  to despite its apparent tolerance of habitat disturbance. The species  may be threatened by loss of large old trees that provide suitable  roosting and breeding habitat through land clearing for agriculture,  urban development, or changed fire regimes in particular the impact of  important central hub roosts is unknown. It has been recorded in the  diet of feral cats (Woinarski et al 2018) Global warming may be a  serious threat to this species in the future because the species is tied  to temperate Australia.","It is widely recorded, in part because it has a call audible to humans  and does not require specialist equipment to detect (Pennay <em>et al.</em>  2011).

Although it has a presumed large population, occurrence in a number of protected areas, and certain tolerance to some degree of habitat modification, the impact of this disease has been extremely severe for eastern North American bats, especially those with large hibernating roosts.","Eastern Pipistrelles can be found in open woods near the edges of water, as well as over water. They are not usually found in open fields or deep forests (Schmidly 1991, Nowak 1999). They roost in rock crevices, caves, buildings, and tree foliage in the summer. During the winter, caves, mines, and deep crevices serve as hibernacula (Briggler and Prather 2003, Sandel <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2001). Eastern Pipistrelles copulate between August and October while “swarming” in front of cave openings. This is the only time the sexes of this species are together- during this time females mate with multiple males (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Eastern Pipistrelles are insectivores and are considered generalists (Hamlin and Myers 2004), they forage most commonly over waterways and at forest edges, analyses of stomach content reveals that its diet is composed of Coleoptera, Homoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera (Fujita and Kunz 1984).<br/><br/>Eastern Pipistrelles are sporadic flyers with a short elliptical flight pattern (Patterson and Hardin 1969). They show a slow, erratic and fluttery flight while foraging (Fujita and Kunz 1984), and are often confused for moths (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).","Recently, the white-nose syndrome (WNS) is becoming the major threat to hibernating bats&#160; in caves (hibernacula) and a number of studies have called the attention that the spread of this disease can extirpate whole caves from the distribution range for some species, including <em>P</em><em>. subflavus&#160;</em>(Alves&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Also, with populations of many cave-hibernating bat species in eastern North America declining as a result of WNS, it is increasingly critical to understand relationships among bats&#160;and forest-management activities.&#160;This species is known to have very specific requirements for roosts on trees. Some studies indicate this species could be affected by wind turbines for generation of energy along part of its distribution.","<em>Perimyotis subflavus</em> is locally abundant in caves during winter but its summer habits are poorly known (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Eastern Pipistrelles have a lifespan of 4 to 8 years in the wild, with the oldest&#160;known record being&#160;14.8 years. (Nowak 1999, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998) Eastern Pipistrelles are obligate hibernators, in warmer climates they hibernate even though food is available (Briggler and Prather 2003). They enter the hibernaculum in late July-October and leave at the beginning of April (Fujita and Kunz 1984). They hibernate in the deepest part of the hibernaculum where temperatures are stable (Schmidly 1991). Hibernating colonies can consist of several thousand individuals, sometimes they share a hibernaculum with other local species (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Eastern Pipistrelles generally hibernate individually, but groups of 2 or 3 have been observed in Texas caves (Sandel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Eastern pipistrelles might choose hibercula based on the closeness to and abundance of forests available to them (Sandel <em>et al</em>. 2001). They also prefer hibernacula with east-facing openings (Briggler and Prather 2003). During the summer, female <em>P. subflavus</em> roost in maternity colonies with an average of 15 individuals. Males roost alone (Whitaker 1998).<br/><br/>The potential impact of WNS on eastern North American bats (Alves&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) suggests a pessimistic scenario for&#160;<em>P. subflavus</em>, which will probably be affected with over 60% of population decline, and could be considered as Endangered (EN) or, if the impact is not so severe, as Vulnerable (VU).

Recent population estimates of 157-207 mature individuals indicate an alarmingly small species population size, with no subpopulation having &gt; 50 mature individuals. The current assessment suggests that the Riverine Rabbit should, under a precautionary purview, remain listed as Critically Endangered C2a(i) due to its inferred small population size and inferred continuing decline from habitat loss and degradation, including ongoing loss of mature individuals. There are an estimated 12 subpopulations (nine in the northern range and three recently discovered south of the historic known range) determined by clusters of &gt;6 sightings within 10 km of each other. Large numbers of surveys throughout the distribution range have confirmed current subpopulations but failed to detect subpopulations in some areas of the historic range (indicated by museum records). Only current subpopulations are used to estimate population size. No subpopulation is estimated to exceed 50 mature individuals (range: 8-46 mature individuals). Subpopulation size was determined by summing independent sightings (non-repeat sightings) from survey data collected between 1999 and 2013. This estimate thus represents minimum sizes and it is possible that subpopulation size is higher, given that this is a cryptic species and difficult to detect. Monitoring work should be continued to improve subpopulation estimates and trends, and this species should be reassessed once further data have been generated. However, we suspect maximum subpopulation size could not be significantly higher, given that previous studies found low densities of the species on the Klipgat farm, Victoria West (0.06–0.17 individuals / ha). Subpopulations are presumably further fragmented and isolated by anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, such as impoundments in river channels and fencing, and are threatened by illegal hunting and predation by domestic animals. Total mature population size (assuming 70% adults) is estimated to be between 157 and 207 individuals.&#160;Additionally, both climate change and fracking are emerging threats to Riverine Rabbits: an initial assessment of climate change indicates that a net reduction of 89% in habitat is likely for the northern population. Fracking of the Karoo region is also likely to further reduce suitable habitat and the two threats may synergise. Thus, although population size in this analysis is likely an underestimate as it is based solely on confirmed current sightings, the Critically Endangered listing is retained (over a possible Endangered listing) as emerging threats are likely to severely threaten the already small population. Systematic monitoring and evidence for conservation interventions are desperately needed. Additionally, as the southern subpopulation may be genetically distinct from the northern animals, genetic work and subsequent taxonomic revision may require a possible reassessment of the two putative subspecies.<br/><br/>This species will require reassessment in the near future as recent citizen science records indicate significant increases in known EOO both southwards and eastwards. Conservation agencies are currently establishing camera traps in the areas to confirm the existence of subpopulations in these areas and once these new data are available, the assessment of this species will be updated and possibly revised.","The Riverine Rabbit inhabits dense riparian growth along the seasonal rivers in the central Karoo (Nama-Karoo shrubland). Specifically, it occurs in riverine vegetation on alluvial soils adjacent to seasonal rivers. The habitat is highly fragmented and transformed. Studies show the habitat to be 61% fragmented in certain areas (Duthie 1989). Observations from the more recently discovered southern Cape population include new records spread over thirteen sites (within three subpopulations), of which nine sites are managed as game reserves/nature reserves. The majority of Riverine Rabbit occupancy lies in the Upper Karoo Bioregion (approximately 80%), with about 12% in the Rainshadow Valley Karoo Bioregion, 4% in the Trans-Escarpment Succulent Karoo Bioregion, 3% the in Western Fynbos-Renosterveld Bioregion and 1% in the Lower Karoo Bioregion (Mucina and Rutherford 2006). For the southern population found within the Little Karoo, the presence occurs within the habitat types as described by Vlok and Schutte-Vlok (2010) including Transitional Shrublands Vegetation Type, Arid Renosterveld Habitat Type, Succulent Karoo Vegetation Type, Apronveld Habitat Type and the Randteveld Habitat Type. However, they are not restricted to the alluvial floodplains in the southern Cape (C. Bragg pers. obs. 2014) and can also occur in old lands not associated with riverine vegetation. Further habitat studies are required.<br/><br/>It should be noted that these are broad habitat types whereas subpopulations in the northern part of the distribution are always associated with alluvial floodplains and narrow belts of riverine vegetation adjacent to seasonal rivers on a scale that is unlikely to fit within these broader habitat types. They are thus highly reliant on the critical resource areas of Karoo riparian ecosystems. These descriptions do, however, give an indication of the general vegetation structure and composition within various parts of its range. Home range has been estimated as 12 ha (Duthie 1989). This species is elusive and nocturnal, spending daylight hours in a scrape beneath riparian vegetation. They are solitary, and will only be found in breeding pairs for short periods, or in female-juvenile pairs for rearing purposes (Duthie 1989).<br/><br/>This species is predominantly a browser, but is known to occasionally feed on grasses during the early wet rainy season when short, green grasses become available (Duthie 1989). When browsing, they have been found to show a particular selection for <em>Pteronia erythrochaetha, Kochia pubescens, Salsola glabrescens</em> and species of Aizoacae. They are unable to survive on heavily overgrazed or agriculturally transformed habitats, but have been found feeding on lucerne fields at night.<br/><br/>Ecosystem and cultural services: It is both a flagship species for the Karoo, as well as an indicator species of riparian habitat fringing the rivers of the Nama (Upper and Central Karoo) and the Succulent Karoo where its presence is associated with ecosystem integrity (healthy ecosystem services, such as water infiltration, vegetation cover, and soil health). Its unique habitat is of economic importance to landowners in terms of cultivation and small-stock grazing. Threats to the river ecosystems include overgrazing and anthropogenic land and river &#160;transformation, which leads to the degradation and fragmentation of Riverine Rabbit habitat.","Both populations face significant threats from ongoing habitat degradation and fragmentation due to detrimental land-use practices and new emerging habitat-transforming land uses, such as climate change and energy development (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Over the last century, <em>c</em>a 40-60% of the fertile alluvial floodplains and riparian habitat has been lost as a result of cultivation (for example, winter wheat production, mostly in the past) and livestock farming (ongoing) (Duthie 1989; Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989, Duthie and Robinson 1990, Coetzee 1994, Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Other threats to the species include hunting (hunted for sport and for bushmeat by farm workers), and accidental mortality in traps set for ‘pest’ animals on farmlands. There is also the potential that the dominance of sheep farming and emerging wildlife ranching for economically valuable species may increase the frequency of both overgrazing (and thus reduction in vital vegetation cover) and predation rates (for example, by higher Black-backed Jackal <em>Canis mesomelas</em> densities). Similarly, habitat degradation through fuel-wood collecting and overgrazing may have led to an increase in predation (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>There are also several emerging threats that could threaten this species. An initial assessment of climate change indicates that a net reduction of 89% in habitat is likely for the northern population (Hughes <em>et al</em>. 2008). Hence further study is urgently required as to potential effects of projected climate change over the entire distribution.<br/><br/>Fracking of the Karoo region is also a major emerging threat to Riverine Rabbit habitat due to ancillary activities associated with fracking, which could lead to increased roadkill mortalities, habitat fragmentation and altered hydrology of Karoo river systems, which in turn impacts on the species’ habitat. Similarly, wind farms are also likely to have a significant impact on the species.<br/><br/>Habitat quantity and quality is declining through overgrazing by livestock, resulting in reduced cover from predators and lack of sufficient forage. Reduction in streamflow owing to the construction of dams upstream has presumably also reduced habitat quality (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). High livestock, and in some cases, wildlife, stocking rates have resulted in large areas of the Karoo having reduced vegetation cover and becoming dominated by unpalatable species, which have further reduced vegetation biodiversity and stocking &#160;potential for livestock and game. Additionally, continued rural settlement expansion on the Northern Cape Province, estimated to be 9% from 2000 to 2013 (GeoTerraImage 2015), will presumably increase rates of poaching and predation by dogs. However, stewardship schemes for this species in the Karoo have also been initiated and cover 350,000 ha in the Greater Karoo. Anecdotal evidence suggests improved biodiversity and Riverine Rabbit populations on these farms, as well as greater landowner awareness of the requirements to protect Riverine Rabbits (C. Bragg unpubl. data). Continued biodiversity stewardship expansion will help to mitigate habitat loss and deterioration.","Riverine Rabbits have a critically low population size. For example, Duthie<em> et al</em>. (1989) found low densities of the species on the Klipgat farm, Victoria West (0.06-0.17 individuals / ha). However, this sample represented too few home ranges to extrapolate to population level. Duthie <em>et al</em>. (1989) speculated that remaining habitat might potentially support around 1,435 individuals. However, densities may vary widely among river systems. For example, there is remaining natural habitat on the Ongers River but there is no evidence of Riverine Rabbit occupancy (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Thus the population size may be very much lower (Duthie<em> et al</em>. 1989).<br/><br/>There are an estimated 12 subpopulations, three in the southern population and nine in the northern population. Subpopulations are isolated from each other by jackal-proof fencing and severe land transformation through agricultural practices. All these subpopulations are estimated to contain less than 50 mature individuals (8–46 mature individuals, based on independent sightings in each river system). There are also an additional five possible historic subpopulations that are represented by five separate museum specimens collected in the past, but no surveys in the past 30 years have confirmed any sightings in those localities, so those five subpopulations are assumed to be locally extinct. To estimate total population size, we used survey data representing confirmed sightings along rivers to indicate size of individual subpopulations along river systems. For population size estimates, the total number of sightings across all 12 subpopulations was 380 individuals, yielding a total population estimate of 207 mature individuals (assuming 70% adults). The alternative estimate, derived from the average density of sightings per 1 km river buffer for all subpopulations multiplied by the total area (AOO), was 224 individuals in total, or 157 mature individuals (Collins and Toit 2016).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is two years (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2004). This species has a single litter per year with 1-2 young per litter in a fur- and grass-lined subterranean chamber excavated in stable soils (Duthie 1989). Reproductive periodicity occurs from August through May (Duthie and Robinson 1990). Gestation time is 35-36 days (Duthie 1989). Longevity in captivity is five years (K. Collins unpubl. data).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the central Karoo region of South Africa. It is associated with the dense, discontinuous vegetation fringing the seasonal rivers. It is the only indigenous burrowing rabbit in Africa, and is dependent on soft and deep alluvial soils along the river courses for constructing stable breeding stops. Approximately 40-60% of habitat was lost or fragmented during the 1930s to 1970s due to agricultural expansion on the seasonal river flood plains across its distribution range (Robinson 1981b, Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989, Duthie and Robinson 1990). Historically, this species was known to occur in five localities towards the northwestern portion of its range, along the Vis and Renoster Rivers, as well as their tributaries near Calvinia (Duthie 1989). The lack of sightings data during the last 30 years, suggests that <em>Bunolagus monticularis</em> is now locally extinct in these regions (Collins and Toit 2016). This is likely to be a direct consequence of the extensive agricultural expansion along riverine floodplains (Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989).<br/><br/>A large number of surveys from 1999-2013 throughout the distribution range has improved our estimates of location and sizes of the various subpopulations, and identified a new southern population in 2004, which now consists of three known subpopulations. The southern population is distributed within three catchments: the Breede, Gouritz and Olifant River systems.<br/><br/>Subpopulations are defined as being made up groups of confirmed sightings along first-, second- or third-order rivers that are within a maximum of 10 km of each other. If the groups of sightings are more than 10 km from each other they are not taken as being from the same subpopulation. Due to limited information about dispersal ability of this species and the fact that known densities where home range studies were carried out showed approximately one Riverine Rabbit for every 400 m of river length, 10 km between confirmed sightings was estimated as a reasonable distance to separate subpopulations. A minimum of six sightings was taken to represent a subpopulation (potentially representing up to three breeding pairs). Where less than six sightings occurred in isolation from survey data, these were assumed to be part of the nearest subpopulation based on connectivity along the rivers.<br/><br/>The approximate ranges of both the northern and southern populations was calculated using Kernel Density home range estimation (buffered by 5 km) and combined to give a total extent of occurrence (EOO), estimated as 54,227 km². To calculate area of occupancy (AOO), all rivers inside the EOO were buffered by 1 km on either side. Similarly, all&#160;sightings points were buffered by a 1 km radius and were used to clip the river buffer providing a total estimate of AOO. A buffer of 1 km was chosen as most of the larger patches of riverine vegetation do not occur more than 1 km from rivers, and by buffering all rivers by 1 km, all known sightings were located within these buffered areas. AOO was thus calculated as 2,943 km².&#160;<em></em>","The Riverine Rabbit is suspected to be opportunistically hunted for sport and for bushmeat by farm workers (Duthie and Robinson 1990, Coetzee 1994).",Terrestrial,"<em>&#160;</em>This species occurs mainly outside of formally protected areas.

There is also a substantial proportion of the species’ habitat from the northern population informally protected within the Riverine Rabbit conservancies. The primary conservation interventions involve further protected area expansion, especially through stewardship programmes, and active habitat restoration.<br/><br/>The Drylands Conservation Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT-DCP) was established in August 2003 and coordinates all conservation efforts on the Riverine Rabbit and its habitat. The programme aims to conserve the biodiversity of the Karoo region, to encourage private landowners to participate in conservation stewardship and to promote integrated land management practices that can sustain the Riverine Rabbit, its habitat and many other species while providing employment for communities and facilitating ecosystem restoration on landowners’ farms. The current projects are:&#160;<br/><ul><li>Riparian habitat restoration: Initiated in 2007, the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project develops and implements strategies to regenerate degraded riparian habitat in order to re-connect remaining riverine habitat fragments. Riparian zones perform a variety of functions including storing water, reducing floods, stabilizing river banks, improving water quality by trapping sediment and nutrients, and providing shelter and food for animals. They provide corridors for movement and migration of different species, including Riverine Rabbits, and act as a buffer between aquatic ecosystems and adjacent land uses. Additionally, maintaining the integrity of riparian areas will help mitigate the effects of climate change, which could potentially heavily impact this semi-arid region. To date, the programme has undertaken restoration interventions, including soil and water erosion control, re-vegetating, grazing reduction, and soil health technologies, of 350 ha of <em>Bunolagus </em>habitat, and is monitoring the recovery of the species in these areas, as well as the subsequent improvement of ecosystem services.</li></ul><ul><li>Establishing alternative livelihoods: Labour for the rehabilitation project is sourced locally, thereby creating employment and developing skills in poor rural communities with few other social upliftment opportunities. Through this approach a strong component of the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project lies in the conservation of water resources and regional biodiversity through community involvement. The EWT-DCP established the Indigenous Karoo Plant Nursery in Loxton (Northern Cape) to support the plant needs of the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project. Community members employed by the nursery are trained to propagate indigenous plants needed for the re-vegetation of Riverine Rabbit habitat within riparian zones in the Karoo. Seed is produced on the production plot within the nursery grounds and are supplemented with seeds harvested in the veld by community members. <br/></li></ul><ul><li>Expanding Riverine Rabbit conservancies and stewardship: Little of the Riverine Rabbit’s remaining habitat is protected within nature reserve or national parks; the survival of the Riverine Rabbit is in the hands of private landowners, consisting mostly of farmers. Therefore the EWT‐DCP works in partnership with provincial conservation departments to involve private landowners in biodiversity conservation through the process of ‘stewardship’. Stewardship refers to the wise use, management and protection of that which has been entrusted to the landowner. Within the context of conservation, stewardship means protecting important ecosystems by effectively managing aspects such as invasive alien species, fires, and grazing and cultivation practices. The EWT-DCP works closely with the four Riverine Rabbit conservancies, encompassing an area of approximately 350,000 ha in the Northern and Western Cape provinces. The long‐term goal of the EWT‐DCP is to use these existing conservancies as a stepping stone to upgrade and declare specific and key properties as Protected Areas in terms of South Africa’s National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (No. 57 of 2003). A critical component of the work is to promote and encourage sustainable land-use practices amongst landowners and land managers in the Karoo through developing partnerships with the relevant stakeholders. Thus the EWT-DCP strives to mainstream sustainable land management principles into agricultural practices in the Karoo and into decisions made by policymakers.</li></ul><ul><li>Environmental Education and Awareness: The EWT-DCP creates awareness about Riverine Rabbit conservation efforts with farmers, farm workers and their families, school learners, teachers, and the general public. It aims to establish custodianship by cultivating a sense of ownership for the Riverine Rabbit, its habitat and the river ecosystems of the Karoo.&#160;</li></ul>Recommendations for land managers and practitioners:<br/><ul><li>Further surveys are needed to identify Riverine Rabbit habitat and occupancy. Hughes <em>et al</em>. (2008) developed a habitat model that showed potential suitable habitat east of Victoria West that might contain isolated subpopulations or offer re-introduction opportunities. The results of such surveys should feed into conservation planning. For example, the work of the Drylands Conservation Programme has succeeded in mitigating impacts of high-risk wind farms through dedicated interventions, particularly in regards to stopping development within suitable habitat. These data would also be used to develop a broad habitat map of the entire distribution range.</li></ul><ul><li>Develop public recognition schemes to encourage private landowners to form conservancies and protect the Riverine Rabbit. Presence on private land should lead to the the exclusion of ranching activities in key habitat areas. This should include developing riparian grazing guidelines to inform sustainable management of riparian areas, and a user-friendly manual of cost-effective sustainable land management technologies to encourage farmers to adopt restoration and sustainable farming practices. Finally, incentives should be identified to encourage landowners to adopt such practices that benefit the species (<em>sensu </em>Pasquini <em>et al</em>. 2010).</li></ul><ul><li>Develop a Riverine Rabbit monitoring tool to facilitate improved conservation outcomes, such as monitoring the impacts of conservation interventions (for example, restoration) on the density of subpopulations and prioritising resources to subpopulations that are declining.</li></ul><ul><li>Development of a legal tool to address Riverine Rabbit conservation: a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (No. 10 of 2004). This includes investigating the genetic and ecological differences between the southern and northern populations and the development of separate conservation strategies for both.</li></ul><ul><li>Although captive breeding was recommended by Collins <em>et al</em>. (2004), captive breeding trials in the 1990s were largely unsuccessful (Dippenaar and Ferguson 1994, Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Thus, the current conservation strategy for the species does not include captive breeding as an option due to the difficulty of breeding this sensitive species in captivity and the higher chance of improving populations in the wild through concerted conservation interventions such as stewardship and habitat restoration.&#160;</li></ul>Encouraged citizen actions:&#160;<br/><ul><li>Landowners can create or join conservancies to protect this species and its habitat.</li></ul><ul><li>Landowners can lower stocking levels to improve riparian ecosystem grazing systems; reduce the number of dogs on farms; and restore riparian habitats through Working for Water and/or the EWT-DCP.</li></ul><ul><li>Landowners and the public can report sightings of individuals on virtual museum platforms (for example, iSpot and MammalMAP) or provincial conservation authorities to enhance the distribution map. For example, new sightings recorded by the public and landowners are recorded in the CapeNature database.&#160;</li></ul>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
45196929,4806,Chrotogale owstoni,Endangered,A2bcd+3bcd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered A2bcd, A3bcd, A4cd because of an ongoing population decline, inferred to exceed 50% over the last three generations (taken as 15 years) and suspected to continue for the next three. This is inferred from over-exploitation, with habitat fragmentation exacerbating the speed at which the species is being extirpated. Hunting is a severe threat because the species is primarily ground-dwelling and so is exposed to the very high levels of snaring and other forms of ground-level trapping throughout its range. This assessment is made without any direct quantification of decline rate. Two largely sympatric ungulates&#160;of broadly similar generation lengths, Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>&#160;and Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em>, are proposed as Critically Endangered under the same criteria for the same reasons. Owston's Civet has always been and remains more widespread than them, and unlike them there is still evidence of&#160;several&#160;high-density&#160;Owston's Civet&#160;populations. While this does not necessarily mean the civet's overall population decline rate is lower, the lower category for Owston's Civet is assigned based on its wider occurrence in montane forest (in which this civet is known to live, in some areas commonly, and up to 2,600 m) and karst (which is predicted to hold viable populations). These habitats, which contain some areas of very rugged and/or highland terrain into which industrial snaring has not yet widely spread, are apparently not occupied by the two ungulates. If market forces drive intensive snaring also into these habitats, then Critically Endangered would be the appropriate category for future decline rates of Owston's Civet given its apparent rapid extirpation across some heavily snared parts of Viet Nam.","Owston’s Civet occurs in a variety of habitats, all within evergreen biomes, linked by the common feature of a non-harsh dry season. It is, or was, much more widely spread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, reflecting the much larger area of Viet Nam with significant humidity in the driest months (i.e., lacking a harsh dry season).&#160;The pattern of locality records in Lao PDR where the species is evidently naturally localised&#160;quite clearly shows that the species has a narrow&#160;habitat usage. Areas with&#160;a non-harsh dry season&#160;in Lao PDR are restricted (Timmins and Trinh 2001).&#160;The areas providing high encounter rates of Owston's Civet in Lao PDR are adjacent to low sections of the Annamite spine (the north-south mountain range forming much of the international border between Lao PDR and Viet Nam) that allow moisture-bearing winds from Viet Nam during Lao PDR's dry season, which in the rest of the country is harsh at lower and mid altitudes (Timmins and Trinh 2001, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Sivilay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Many other evergreen forest survey areas across the country lack records,&#160;despite the use therein of methods suitable to find the species, at adequate intensities, and the finding of multiple hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling mammals,&#160;It is essentially absent from the predominant evergreen forest types of Lao PDR, lowland, mid-elevation and lower montane semi-evergreen (dry evergreen) and lower montane forests. This is based on spotlighting in several survey areas supporting these forest types in the early - mid 1990s (Duckworth 1997) and on camera-trapping in the 21st century in Phou Sithon, Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA), Laving-Laveun NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area and Xe Sap NBCA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); the hunting intensity in all of these at the time of camera-trapping was equivalent to Pu Mat before (sometimes well before) 1998, about when the species was still readily detected by camera-traps. It is evidently locally present in Lao PDR below 1,000 m where wet evergreen forest occurs, but the absence of records from Laving-Laveun NBCA, which holds various other wet&#160;evergreen forest species,&#160;suggests that Owston's Civet is particularly sensitive to climatic conditions. It also occurs in montane evergreen forest (over 1,000 m), but is probably equally restricted by climatic conditions in its geographic and altitudinal range. Montane areas&#160;with wet climates, such as various high peaks in eastern parts of Lao PDR, appear to support the species over a relatively wide range (e.g., Xe Sap NBCA; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whilst peaks further west (greater rain-shadowing during the winter) appear to support more localised populations (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey NBCA; Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wet evergreen forest is, or was, far more widespread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, but it is not universal. The strong evidence from Lao PDR for climatic sensitivity of Owston's Civet suggests that some Viet Namese evergreen forests will hold the species sparsely or not at all (those in a&#160;rain-shadow).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Annamite wet evergreen forest of Lao PDR, Owston's Civet has been recorded as high as suitable survey has occurred (1,500 m; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The few records from Lao PDR's northern highlands, mostly imprecisely located (barring that in Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009), are likely to come from higher altitudes where the colder temperatures ameliorate the low dry-season rainfall. Thus, in Lao PDR Owston's Civet is likely to occur&#160;mostly in hill and montane altitudes, although there are credible reports from as low as 550 m (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whereas in Viet Nam the species has a wide altitudinal range, right down to the plains and up to 2,600 m (Van Ban district, Lao Kay province, in 2002; S. Swan pers. comm. 2014). Recent camera-trap records at&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, in the northern highlands of Viet Nam, come from altitudes of 1,722-2,444 m a.s.l.; there was very little survey effort below 1,700 m (B.M. Rawson pers, comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Captive animals in both Viet Nam and the U.K. relish earthworms (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014) and the species's skull and dentition suggest an invertebrate diet (Thomas 1927). An earthworm-dominated diet would explain the tight linkage with year-round humidity, given that in the parts of Lao PDR with a harsh dry season earthworms are not accessible during that season. This remains purely speculative, especially given that the component of Owston's Civet range south of the northern highlands resembles that of various other species unlikely to depend directly on access to earthworms, e.g. Annamite Striped Rabbit <em>Nesolagus timminsi</em>&#160;and Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>.<br/><br/>Suitable forests, in Viet Nam at least, include some on limestone and some dominated by bamboo (Roberton 2007). There are indications from Lao PDR of occurrence in degraded and edge habitat such as banana gardens (King 2002), but these remain to be confirmed. The lack of records from deciduous forest surely reflects the genuine pattern of occurrence.<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has not been studied in the field, but camera-trapping indicates that it is nocturnal, largely solitary and presumably largely active at ground level (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), although there is at least one record of a wild animal 3 m up a tree (Dang and Le 2010). The species climbs well in captivity (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).","Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the two countries holding most of the geographic range of Owston's Civet, have among the highest levels of non-specific mammal hunting in the world. For many decades hunting with projectiles, dogs, and traps fabricated from local plant materials has been very high, for largely local use. From the late 1980s, rising throughout the 1990s, 2000s and into the 2010s, rapidly increasing affluence of Chinese and Viet Namese consumers and, to a lesser extent, those in Lao PDR has fuelled an explosive rise in urban demand for wildlife meat, including civets (e.g., Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Lao PDR, the same situation has developed, largely for export rather than in-country consumption. This demand has resulted in levels of snaring probably unprecedented anywhere in the world, using durable materials (metal) linked by brushwood drift-fences. These are evidently extremely efficient in extirpating mobile ground-dwelling mammals of civet size (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014); some areas of little-degraded forest now support negligible densities of ground-dwelling mammals of this size class and above (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Although such trade-driven off-take of large mammals from protected areas and such wildlife trade is unambiguously illegal in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam, enforcement is uneven and the large profits to be made hamper effective resolution of the problem. In parts of Lao PDR, trade prices for wild meat are so high and wild stocks so depleted that severe dietary problems are evident among rural hill people (i.e., those without access rights to productive fisheries) (Krahn and Johnson 2007). There is no reason to expect these hunting levels to decline until the wildlife species affected have been hunted out; larger species such as big cats <em>Panthera</em>, wild cattle <em>Bos</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> are already widely extirpated in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), yet hunting continues. Some Viet Namese areas camera-trapped and discussed by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) were almost bereft of any ground-dwelling mammals or birds bigger than rats. This is the plausible end-point for most areas holding Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>By contrast, Owston's Civet seems to be fairly resilient to long-standing hunting methods and intensities, judging by the numbers that were and still are camera-trapped in in Viet Nam's northern highlands (Swan and O'Reilly 2004, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004, B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). In contrast to Owston's Civet, many other hunting-sensitive species in these areas were or are already extirpated or reduced to numbers so low as to evade detection. This area has no or negligible trade-driven operation of metal snares in long lines; this lack is typical of Hmong-dominated northern highland areas (J. Tordoff pers. comm. 2014). Most hunting for mammals of civet-size and over in these areas is active, with projectiles and with dogs,&#160;rather than by passive trapping; and it is&#160;by day (B. Long pers comm. 2014). The nocturnal, solitary, generally inconspicuous habits of Owston's Civet evidently facilitate its survival in such areas; its dens must be in areas not readily found by dogs.<br/><br/>Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation have affected large areas of Owston’s Civet range (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989), particularly in Viet Nam and increasingly in Lao PDR. Habitat fragmentation magnifies the impact of hunting on populations, particularly when roads are built into areas of, until then, limited accessibility. Vehicle access makes the harvest of a whole host of mid-price marketable materials such as civet meat economically viable where previously the labour investment of carrying heavy loads long distances restrained off-take in those areas to high-value products and what was required for living off the land during the process. An ongoing massive expansion of the road system in Lao PDR, in part related to large infrastructure construction such as dams and mines (e.g., Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2014), is likely to bring most of the Lao areas holding Owston's Civet within close-enough range of vehicle access that general wildlife meat extraction is economically feasible. This is already the case for most of the Viet Namese areas.<br/><br/>The exceptions to this grim assessment include karst massifs (into which road building is rarely economically viable), montane areas inhabited by people who disdain snaring, and any protected areas which develop effective enough management regimes before the species is extirpated. While there are Owston's Civet records form karst, densities within such landscapes are unknown, as is the degree to which the&#160;species&#160;depends upon tall forests there (themselves rather patchy in occurrence in karst landscapes). The extent to which industrial snaring will spread into hill areas already largely depleted of animals larger than civets (by day-time shooting and hunting with dogs), notably large areas of the northern highlands, is unclear; if some such areas do not start to deploy it (for various reasons, such as ongoing remoteness from road networks, or the cultural predispositions of the inhabitants), these areas will also be important havens to Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>The adaptability of Owston's Civet to non-hunted degraded and fragmented areas is unknown, but so long as snaring remains uncontrolled, is moot.","The total population of Owston's Civet will always have been much smaller than that of most other mainland South-east Asian civets because it has such a small geographic range. There is insufficient&#160;baseline information to define the precise&#160;range and even the general abundance in the era before trade-driven hunting began to accelerate steeply in the 1980s with the increasingly wide deployment of cable-snares in long lines linked by brushwood drift fences. Therefore, its population trend needs to be inferred from trends in habitat and in hunting (types, distributions and intensities), based on a hypothesised geographic and ecological distribution, itself inferred from habitat (from which the known precisely located records come) and distributions of ecologically restricted co-occurring species.<br/><br/>Severe declines probably started in the early 1990s, Around this time, evidence suggests other ground-dwelling, now much-declined, Annamite-centred species such as Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em> and&#160;Edwards’s Pheasant <em>Lophura edwardsii</em>&#160;were, by today’s standards, still common in accessible Viet Namese forests. Camera-trapping in the late 1990s in Pu Mat Nature Reserve and in Huong Son district (SFNC 2000, Timmins and Trinh 2001) suggested that the species was still relatively common in mid-elevation forests where hunting pressure was already relatively intense. The number of animals in trade in the 1990s (e.g., at Ban Lak-20 (= Ban Lak Xao) in Lao PDR; received by the Owston’s Civet Project at&#160;Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam; and observed in trade near Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and as&#160;stuffed specimens along route 1, both Viet Nam) all suggest the species was frequent thereabouts, presumably in the mid-elevation forest where the bulk of snaring was then taking place. There is no pointer, when the difficulties of detecting this species by typical pre-camera-trap surveys are accounted for, to suggest that Owston’s Civet was not a common species throughout mid-elevation Vietnamese wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section), prior to the advent of intensive snaring.<br/><br/>Within its range, it evidently reached, and locally still reaches, high densities within favoured habitat. Bourret (1944) considered it to be the most common civet between the Fansipan mountains and the Black river in northern Viet Nam. Two camera-trapping surveys in Viet Nam around the turn of the century, one in the Hoang Lien mountains in the north-west of the country and the other in Pu Mat Nature Reserve in the northern Annamites found this civet to be among the most commonly photographed small carnivores in these areas (SFNC 2000, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004). Pu Mat NR has not been resurveyed, but this assessment&#160;is still appropriate for the highland areas of Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, both in/near the Hoan Lien mountains, in 2013 camera-trapping (B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). The same was found in 2012-2013 in Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b) and during the preceding decade in parts of eastern Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In some other areas that it has been found, it has been among the least recorded species by camera-trap, e.g. Quang Nam province, Viet Nam (Long and Minh 2006), western Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Nam Et-Phou Louey NPA in the northern highlands of Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). The patterns&#160;of the other hunting-sensitive species recorded by these surveys suggest that Owston's Civet abundance is highly heterogeneous dependent upon habitat, not that the low encounter rates in these areas are&#160;solely a result of overhunting (although this&#160;might be responsible in part or whole for the low encounter rate in Quang Nam).<br/><br/>However, hunting is likely to be the explanation for the stark temporal pattern shown by the review of camera-trapping in Viet Nam by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Of the five camera-trapping surveys operating in Viet Nam during&#160;1998–2006, all found Owston’s &#160;Civet; the four in 2006–2013 all did not. (Two additional sites surveyed in the latter period, Cat Tien NP and U Minh, also did not find&#160;Owston’s Civet but are excluded from the comparison as being outside the species's likely range.) Very recent (late 2013) camera-trapping in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve (Kon Tum province, Viet Nam) and two northern highland sites,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, found Owston's Civet to be one of most commonly photographed small carnivores (Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014,&#160;B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). These anomalies within the 2006-2013 time period, not available in time for the Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) review, are both in very mountainous areas consequently less economically appealing to market hunters. Higher hunting pressures, notably snaring intensities, typify most of the survey areas included in Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Excepting the results from Ngoc Linh NR,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, the lack of Viet Namese records from 2006 onwards suggests a major recent decline in the species in sites across the country with large populations&#160;left only in forested steep highland massifs. This suspected decline&#160;is corroborated by the failure of over 15,000 camera-trap-nights of effort in wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves, Viet Nam, since August 2012 to find the species (WWF pers. comm. to Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Nor has it been found in another lowland area of wet&#160;evergreen forest, Khe Nuoc Truong in Quang Binh province, where extensive camera-trapping recorded many other small carnivore species (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2014). For none of these 2006-2013 Viet Nam camera-trap survey areas is there evidence of a pre-intensive-snaring large population of Owston' Civet. However, assessing them based on habitat and other Annamite wet evergreen forest species' status (see 'Habitats and ecology' section; R.J. Timmins [pers. comm. 2014] has&#160;surveyed in most of them and studied all on aerial imagery), Khe Nuoc Truong, Hoang Son, and non-limestone forests in the Phong Nha-Ke Bang area,&#160;are&#160;probably&#160;prime Owston’s Civet habitat; Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves are very similar to Pu Mat NR; and Ke Go is hard to know, because few other sites are topographically similar, and the topography influences local climate. Even Crested Argus&#160;<em>Rheinardia ocellata</em>&#160;(among the least hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling wet evergreen forest species)&#160;has not been camera-trapped in the&#160;Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves;&#160;they are some of the most heavily hunted large forest blocks that R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014) has&#160;ever been to.<br/><br/>A decline of such magnitude was not suspected during the last Red List assessment for this species, for 2008. At that stage, all camera-trap surveys within its range typically found the species, sometimes commonly. The high encounter rates in some areas suggests a high starting population and thus a long time until near extirpation (and the concomitant ability of generalised camera-trapping to note a paucity of records). Another factor weighed for the 2008 listing as Vulnerable was that one of the surveys camera-trapping the species commonly, in Hoang Lien Son of far northern Viet Nam, was amid highly degraded and fragmented forest which had been subjected to high levels of traditional hunting for decades (see Swan and O'Reilly 2004) and thus the species was resilient to hunting pressure. However, it now seems more likely that Owston's Civet differs in sensitivity to different styles of hunting (see 'Threats'). The current overall population trend is thus assessed to be steeply downwards. Probably, the main phase of decline in Viet Nam has already occurred, with most areas holding the species there now having only low numbers with large populations persisting only in the northern highlands and most rugged part of the Annamites, Lao PDR, retaining much larger areas of forest without road incursion and a much lower human population, still retains at least one large population, plausibly several (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), but the national trend in 2015-2030 is likely to replicate that of Viet Nam in 1999-2014.<br/><br/>No information on the present population status in the Chinese part of the range was traced. Indeed, it is not clear that the species is still extant there.",Decreasing,"Owston's Civet is known to occur across a wide latitudinal range of both eastern Lao PDR (Sivilay&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) and Viet Nam (Roberton&#160;2007,&#160;Dang and Le 2010), and in a small area of southernmost China, possibly only in Hekou, Luchun and Jinping counties of Yunnan province (Wang Ying-xiang 2003) but perhaps also in adjacent Guangxi province (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). It has not been found west of the Mekong river (Corbet and Hill 1992) and indeed occurrence in Lao PDR is restricted largely to the easternmost areas that have similarities in climate to Viet Nam. The range may also potentially extend into easternmost Cambodia: two individuals seen in the Phnom Tamao zoo (Phnom Penh) collection of stuffed mounts in the late 1990s were unlikely to have originated outside Cambodia (C.M. Poole pers. comm. to Dang and Le 2010). However, extensive surveys in Cambodia's eastern provinces have not found the species (e.g., Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, E.H.B. Pollard pers. comm. 2012). Perhaps the most likely area of Cambodia, eastern Virachey National Park, remains very little camera-trapped. Suitable methodology (camera-trapping and/or spotlighting) has been applied widely enough in the southern half of Lao PDR to be confident the species is entirely or largely restricted to the east in the south and latitudinal centre; capable searches have been less widespread in the northern highlands.<br/><br/>Records come from the range 100-2,600 m, but, particularly west of the Annamites, only a subset of this full range is likely to be occupied in any given area (see 'Habitats and ecology').","Owston's Civet is taken for meat and traditional medicine (including its bones, scent gland, and penis) in all of its range countries; there is not suspected to be any targeted hunting of the species, but much hunting in its range is non-selective (e.g. snares) to supply the general wildlife meat market (Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011,&#160;B. Long&#160;pers. comm. 2006,&#160;S.I. Roberton pers. comm. 2006).",Terrestrial,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered on the China Red List and as Vulnerable in the Viet Nam Red Book (MOSTE 2000). It is protected in Yunnan province, but not in Guangxi (GMA Small Carnivore Workshop 2006). In Viet Nam the species is listed in group IIB meaning exploitation is regulated but not prohibited (Decree 32/2006/ND-CP). In Lao PDR, the species is listed in group I (Prohibition category) of the hunting regulations (Prime Minister Decree 81, 2008; Wildlife hunting regulation).<br/><br/>An international breeding programme, coordinated from Viet Nam, has been established with populations in Europe and Viet Nam. However numbers are still too low for long-term viability (J.

They have, however, somewhat to greatly slowed the expansion of the road system, and thus maintained areas in which it is only marginally economically viable to harvest wildlife meat in bulk; and they have reduced the chance of landscape-level habitat transformation projects such as concession plantations.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45202281,23036,Viverra civettina,Critically Endangered,C2a(i),2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) because there are no recent reliable records of wild individuals and none are known in captivity.&#160;Various&#160;surveys during 1990-2014 in potentially suitable habitats across its purported distribution range have generated no records, despite using techniques that reliably find related species when they are present (notably, camera-trapping). This lack of records despite these surveys indicates that its population, if extant at all, is likely to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no subpopulation greater than 50 individuals. A continuing decline is inferred from the lack of any recent records (Nandini and Mudappa 2010). Its distribution and ecology are effectively unknown, because there are no reliable documented records, ever, of the species in the wild (Nandini and Mudappa 2010). The species is known only from eight specimens collected over a century ago and four more recently, with the last in 1989 (Nandini and Mudappa 2010).","There is no reliable information about Malabar Civet's habitat use or other aspects of its ecology. The several descriptions of habitat use are speculative or based in whole or part on confusion with other species. It seems that it once inhabited lowland forests, lowland swamp and riparian forests in the coastal plain districts of the Western Ghats. Village reports suggested occurrence in thickets in cashew plantations and in highly degraded lowland forests in northern Kerala (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). It could possibly occur in lowland riparian forests in the coastal plain districts (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Based on the natural history of congeners, the species is probably nocturnal, ground-dwelling and readily camera-trapped when present.<br/> <br/> Natural forests have completely disappeared from the coastal Western Ghats. Present vegetation is secondary in origin (Champion and Seth 1968), and is mostly plantations (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Of these, cashew plantations are the least disturbed, because they are not weeded, providing a dense understorey of shrubs and grasses for this ground-living species to take refuge in (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). The pelt records from 1980-1990 were in the region of river valleys, suggesting a possible association with shallow water courses (Ashraf <em>et al</em>, 1993). The closely related Large-spotted Civet is strongly associated with the forested level lowlands (e.g., Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014); whether this is also true of Malabar Civet, which occurs within a rather different small carnivore community (notably, no other species of <em>Viverra</em>&#160;overlaps with it) is unknown.","Assuming habitat use similar to that of&#160;Large-spotted Civet,&#160;Malabar Civet&#160;is likely to have undergone a massive<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;decline<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;a century ago because of extensive conversion&#160;of forest to agriculture.&#160;Coastal plain forest was never extensive in&#160;its presumed range&#160;because the Western Ghats hill range run quite close to the coast along its&#160;length.&#160;Natural forests have completely disappeared from the coastal Western Ghats (Champion and Seth 1968).&#160;Land-use and habitat changes have not been too drastic in the last century within the assumed distribution range of the Malabar Civet.&#160;The records late in this period, if they were of wild animals, therefore suggest an ability to persist in today's habitat matrix, specifically in deforested areas and/or forest above the plains. In either case, many areas of potentially suitable habitat persist. Thus, habitat factors alone are unlikely to have been an unlikely driver of<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;of its present extreme rarity.&#160;There may be significant loss of natural and semi-natural habitat over the next decade with many hydro-power projects being proposed in the region. Cashew plantations, which might hold most of the surviving populations of this species, are threatened by large-scale clearance (Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993).&#160;<br/> <br/> The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this&#160;species's range&#160;during 1965-1970 (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the past, this species might have been used to collect civet oil, although there are no records to authenticate this claim. Small Indian Civet is still illegally ‘farmed’ and kept in captivity to extract civet, and any remaining Malabar Civets are likely to be at risk for the same reason.&#160;<br/><br/>Villagers report retaliatory killings of civets, taken by the interviewers to include Malabar Civet, for raiding poultry – although there is no hard evidence this species is killed for this reason. Once again it might be a case of mistaken identity between Malabar Civet and Small Indian Civet or even Common Palm Civet.&#160;The most recent skins apparently came from outside protected areas, suggesting that hunting is likely to remain a threat to this already rare species (Ashraf <em>et al</em> 1993). There are a few&#160;protected areas&#160;in the lowland of Kerala, but whether the species inhabits them is unknown.&#160;This species is not selectively hunted, but 10 of 22 reports of animals assessed by Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1990) to relate to this species and made&#160;during 1950 to 1990 were caught by dogs;&#160;there is no evidence that these reports actually relate even in part to Malabar Civet. Whatever the proportion of report of retaliatory killing and hunting that truly relate to Malabar Civet, that these practices occur in the species's presumed range means that they are likely to threaten any remaining&#160;Malabar Civets.</span>","The population status is unknown but the lack of any even possible record since the advent of widespread camera-trapping suggests that very few animals, at most, persist. Three recent attempts to find the species failed (Jayson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/> <br/> This species was formerly believed to be very common in the districts of Malabar and Travancore in southwest India, based on Jerdon (1874). However, Nandini and Mudappa (2010) concluded that&#160;Jerdon’s statements were a case of misidentification of the more common (even now) Small Indian Civet, supporting Pocock’s (1933) doubts about Jerdon’s report. But by the late 1960s it was thought to be near extinction. No sighting was claimed until 1987; then, and subsequently, there have been no confirmed records of wild or captive animals: only equivocal sightings&#160;(without any supporting evidence to confirm the species identification)&#160;and dead animals plausibly from captivity (Nandini and Mudappa 2010).",Decreasing,"Malabar Civet is believed to be endemic to the Western Ghats of&#160;southern&#160;India. All records lack precise locality (historical&#160;specimens all came from zoo animals with no information on original&#160;source)&#160;and most have little or no information on origin. Taken together they suggest a distribution in the lowlands from Kanyakumari in the extreme south north to Wayanad, Coorg, and Honnavar in Karnataka (Pocock 1933, 1939, Corbet and Hill 1992, Nandini and Mudappa 2010). There are only two reports of its occurrence in the higher elevations (over 600 m) of the Western Ghats, in the High Wavy Mountains (Hutton 1949) and at Kudremukh (Karanth 1986). The former is very likely to be in error and the latter was&#160;based on a single-observer sight-record left unidentified for some years&#160;(Nandini and Mudappa 2010). By the late 1960s, the&#160;species&#160;was thought to be near extinction. In the decades until the late 1980s, there were only two possible records, from Kudremukh in Karnataka (Karanth 1986) and from&#160;Tiruvella in Kerala (Kurup 1989); both lack objectively verifiable evidence.&#160;Rai and Kumar (1993) reported possible occurrence in the&#160;state of&#160;Karnataka based on the sighting by Karanth (1986) and unsubstantiated interviews with local hunters.&#160;In the late 1980s, skins of recently killed Malabar Civets were obtained in Elayur, in the lowland Western Ghats, in Malappuram district, Kerala (Kurup 1989) and near Nilambur, northern Kerala (Ahsraf <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993), although&#160;these&#160;seem subsequently to have been lost.","The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this&#160;species's range&#160;during 1965-1970 (Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993). In the past, this species might have been used to collect civet oil, although there are no records to authenticate this claim. Small Indian Civet is still illegally ‘farmed’ and kept in captivity to extract civet, and any remaining Malabar Civets are likely to be at risk for the same reason.",Terrestrial,"Malabar Civet is listed in Schedule I, part I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and on CITES Appendix III (India). This species is not known to occur in any protected area and the declaration of large new protected areas in its range is unlikely because of the dense human populations (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Ashraf <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. (1993) recommended the following conservation actions for this species: captive breeding (with the possibility of reintroduction if suitable undisturbed areas are identified), field surveys (to investigate whether this species occurs in protected areas) and ecological studies (to determine the threats to this species). An urgent conservation action plan is needed. Given that recently it has been not possible to find the species at all, the option of captive breeding is not currently practical. Reintroduction, assuming that some environmental threats have dissipated the populations, it would need considerable amount of work to nullify those threats having firstly established what they are. Field survey should be continued, although many in the last decade have not yielded any positive results (Jayson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 2009). As noted by Nandini and Mudappa (2010) in a detailed review of the knowledge of the Malabar Civet, none of the historical specimens have reliable provenance; and even for the more recent ones it is fairly vague: not one has&#160;a precise wild locality of origin. It therefore is imperative to assess the status of the specimens&#160;in various museums and collections using advanced techniques of molecular genetics. This should consider whether the species is in fact a valid taxon native to India, or an incidental result of the wide trans-shipment of various civet species that occurred around the Indian Ocean counties for many centuries.",Indomalayan,none certain,true,false,Global
45209459,70205537,Arctonyx collaris,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Greater Hog Badger is listed as Vulnerable because it is undergoing a hunting-driven population decline. Although rates in the eastern parts&#160;of its range, notably Viet Nam and Lao PDR, on average probably exceed 50% per 15 years (three generations), in large parts of the west and centre they may not even reach rates appropriate for Near Threatened listing (20-25%). Thus, Vulnerable is a global average. There is no reason to expect the decline rates to slow down; in particular, in Myanmar and Cambodia they may be increasing, fuelled by rising affluence and market connectivity. The situation in Cambodia is particularly likely to worsen, with increasing snaring in the eastern provinces that border Viet Nam, a known demand for traditional medicine that might be widespread in rural areas, and ongoing massive clearance of natural habitat for&#160;agro-industrial concessions.&#160;This species should be periodically reassessed for the Red List in light of ongoing threats and uncertainty about range-wide levels of exploitation and the effects these are having on wild populations. The change from the recent Near Threatened listing of <em>Arctonyx collaris&#160;</em>(<em>sensu lato</em>) reflects the taxonomic revision, excluding the populations of Sumatra (where ongoing declines are likely to be negligible) and most of China (where declines are also likely to be lower than average for Greater Hog Badger).","Greater Hog Badger is active throughout the day and night (despite past statements that the genus is nocturnal), ground-dwelling, and not very wary of people (e.g., Pocock 1941, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Helgen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Johnson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Holden and Neang 2009, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Gray <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014b).<br/><br/>Greater Hog Badger occurs down to the extreme lowlands (e.g. Bottom-Soaker National Park, Cambodia, and Kaziranga NP, Assam, India; Royan 2010,&#160;Choudhury 2013) up into the montane zone. The genus has been found up to 3,500 m, but Helgen <em>et al</em>. (2008) traced no record of this species above the relatively modest altitude of 1,500 m. Similarly, and based largely on different sets of records, the highest-altitude records traced for various countries are, Vietnam, 950 m (Roberton 2007); Cambodia, 1,200 m (Holden and Neang 2009); Myanmar, 1,500 m (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008); and Thailand, 1,016 m (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) . However, as cautioned by&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008), relevant survey effort above 1,500 m has been relatively limited in Myanmar and this is generally true throughout this species's range. Thus, the typical upper altitudinal limit may be found to be somewhat, even considerably, higher, as supported by records in Lao PDR up to nearly 2,300 m (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Choudhury (2013) recorded the genus up to 2,000 m in India, but suggested that the higher-altitude records would be of <em>A. albogularis</em>.<br/><br/>This species occurs across a wide variety of habitats, from heavy forest (both deciduous and evergreen) to the non-forested 'countryside' in at least North-east India; this includes grassland-dominated floodplains such as Kaziranga NP in Assam (Choudhury 2013), where it is one of the most frequently camera-trapped small carnivores (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). There are also records in Bangladesh (assumed to be this species) from tea-gardens and other non-forest habitats (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). In South-east Asia most records come from forests. The extent of actual and potential occupation of non-forest habitats is unknown: concerted survey in them is rare and off-take of mammals of this size is heavy in much of this species's range. Thus, it is possible&#160;that they would occur widely in non-forest parts of&#160;South-east Asia but are currently excluded by hunting levels.<br/><br/>The diet is poorly known, but Helgen <em>et al</em>. (2008) speculated that it might be partly to strongly vermivorous. This was based on morphological attributes more than on direct dietary information. A strong dependence on worms would neatly explain the pattern of current habitat use in Lao PDR (see 'population') - widespread and still locally common in montane areas but nearly or effectively extirpated from the plains. The country's plains have a harsh dry season, when the ground even within semi-evergreen forest (true evergreen forest is highly localised in the country's lowlands) bakes hard. Finding large numbers of worms under such conditions is presumably difficult and highly demanding of energy. By contrast, in the mountains, forest soil remains damper through the dry season, as a result of cooler temperatures, the sometimes frequent mists and cloud, and the fuller shading of true evergreen forest. Thus, in regions with a harsh dry season, it is reasonable to suppose higher population densities in hills and mountains than in plains and low hills, and a higher resilience to hunting. Such seasonality occurs almost across the species's range excepting most of Vietnam, the Thai-Malay peninsula and locally around massifs large enough to generate their own precipitation. Nonetheless, the species does occur in plains regions of Cambodia and Thailand with dry seasons as or more harsh than in Lao PDR; these areas have&#160;somewhat to much lower hunting pressure.","The heterogeneous pattern of Greater Hog Badger detections and the variation in encounter rates, with the lowest rates in the very heavily hunted countries of Viet Nam and Lao PDR, strongly suggest that the species is in hunting-driven decline. Based on Lao PDR, extirpation, or decline to densities making detections extremely unlikely, seems to have proceeded faster in areas with marked dry seasons than in mountain evergreen forests with a more benign dry season, presumably because starting populations were higher in the latter habitats than in the former (see 'Habitats and ecology'). In Viet Nam, trade-driven hunting rose to industrial levels&#160;a decade or so earlier than in Lao PDR. The low number of camera-trap survey areas in Viet Nam with records of the species indicate that even in the presumed optimal habitats of evergreen forest with only a mild dry season, steep declines and, presumably, extirpation can occur. To date, hunting is at much lower levels in the rest of this species's range. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, much hunting involves metal cable snares set in long lines linked by drift fences, an approach very effective in catching ground-dwelling animals (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014); these snares are, mostly, big enough to secure Greater Hog Badger, because large ungulates are amongst the main targets. The geographical use of such snaring has expanded rapidly over the last 20 years and evidently continues to do so. In much of the species's range, most people entering forest and other natural habitat for whatever reason are accompanied by dogs, many have firearms, and most secure opportunistically any animal of hog badger size-class that they come across. Being partly diurnal, ground-dwelling and not prone to shyness, hog badgers must be particularly at risk to such opportunistic off-take.<br/><br/>The threat which habitat change poses directly to this species is not clear. Indirectly, anything that opens up access to areas previously difficult to enter, in particular which allows vehicular removal of wildlife for sale, exacerbates the hunting threat. Almost all forms of habitat change by people co-occur with increased human access and presence, making the indirect threat from habitat change severe. Based on localities of specific records, it is unlikely that degraded and fragmented natural habitat are inherently unsuitable. These are not widely occupied probably because their higher densities of people, with concomitantly increased likelihood for badgers of lethal incidental encounters with people, prevent this. Outright conversion to entirely artificial habitat (agriculture, settlement and infrastructure) seems more likely to render an area unsuitable for Greater Hog Badger, but even this remains to be proven. Overall, the existence of large tracts of forest in the eastern parts of the species's range with at best low densities of this species indicate that there the chief threat is hunting. While perhaps this is not yet so in parts of the western range, it is increasingly likely to become so there, too.<br/><br/>In Kaziranga National Park, India, numbers die in the periodic inundation of this flood-plain (Choudhury 2013). While formerly such animals might have been able to move safely to higher ground, the increasing fragmentation of natural habitat probably leads to higher mortalities nowadays. Nonetheless, in total these are likely to be insignificant to overall decline rates of the species, and are only a potential threat at the most local of levels.<br/><br/>Hog badger hairs are used in European shaving brush manufacture (Domingo-Roura <em>et al</em>. 2006) but whether this species and wild populations are involved is unclear; the large farmed stock in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) seems a more likely origin.","Greater Hog Badger populations have not been studied in sufficient detail for densities or trends to be known in any part of the range. Camera-trap encounter rates vary widely across its range: in some it is among the most commonly and widely photographed small carnivores, such as in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Nakai–Nam Theun National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), in others it is only rarely found if at all (e.g., modern Viet Nam: Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3).<br/><br/>At least two factors might produce this heterogeneous recording pattern: (i) natural variation in densities and (ii) human-induced declines proceeding at different rates across the range.&#160;Both are probably important. Past information is rarely precise enough to assess even the coarse population trend directly. However, judging by patterns in better documented hunting-sensitive groups of ground-dwelling mammals (e.g., wild cattle <em>Bo</em><em>s</em>, Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em>, Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>), it would be reasonable to expect human pressure to have depressed densities in Lao PDR and Viet Nam more than in Thailand and Cambodia. And this indeed seems to have happened. Recent camera-trapping has recorded the species in only very few areas in Viet Nam (Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3, Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014); Roberton (2007) had already drawn attention to the surprising paucity of records in the country in the 1990s and early 2000s. In Lao PDR, by contrast, all published large-scale camera-trap surveys have found the species (Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA,&#160;Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009; Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014; Xe Sap NPA, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b), indicating a healthier status than in Vietnam (as is typical for hunting-sensitive species). The three camera-trap survey areas are likely to hold amongst the least-depleted large mammal faunas in Lao PDR. All are in rugged mountainous areas and indeed all post-1990 Lao records of Hog Badger come from hill and montane areas; there has been none from the plains. This pattern, making due allowance for the distribution of survey effort, was already apparent in the pre-camera-trapping era by 1999, based on direct sightings and records of dead animals or their parts (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). By contrast, this species is commonly recorded at low altitudes, including in plains landscapes, of Thailand and Cambodia (Royan 2010, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a,&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014) and it is common in similar lowland terrain in Kaziranga NP, Assam (Choudhury 2013). This suggests strongly that the absence of recent Lao records from such terrain (where hunting is more efficient than in rugged terrain, meaning that hunting-sensitive species across a range of vertebrate taxa tend to have declined faster there) reflects steep declines (and plausibly widespread extirpation) there.<br/><br/>The occurrence in Myanmar is also patchy without obvious natural explanation (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008); thus far, the pattern of records has not been&#160;compared closely with those of species known to be sensitive to hunting.&#160;In&#160;Cambodia, while it has been recorded relatively commonly in some areas such as parts of the north-east (Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a), in the 'northern plains', west of the Mekong, it was not recorded in 6,000 camera-trap nights of survey in the 2012-2013 and 2013–2014 dry seasons, and the most recent record there seems to have been in 2001 (D. H. A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). Thus area abuts Lao PDR and this apparent range retreat corroborates the suggestion that it has been hunted out from such habitat in Lao PDR.&#160;In Thailand, it seems to remain generally common with no large landscapes of (semi-) natural habitat lacking records (when patterns in survey effort are allowed for) (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In North-east India the genus, although widespread, is generally not common (Choudhury 2013). The population status in its Chinese range (part of Yunnan province) seems poorly known, even at the level of genus.",Decreasing,"Greater Hog Badger occurs from Bangladesh and North-east India east through Myanmar, Thailand and Lao PDR to Vietnam and south to Cambodia and peninsula Thailand; it probably also inhabits Yunnan province, China. Inconclusive reports from the state of Perak, northernmost peninsular Malaysia, have never been confirmed (Helgen<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2008).<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<br/><br/>The range in Bangladesh and North-east India is provisional.&#160;Because&#160;Helgen <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008)&#160;traced only a few hog badger records from this area&#160;that could be assigned to species, both mainland hog badger species might occur in this area:&#160;so&#160;the many recent records simply&#160;identified as 'hog badger' should not, at this&#160;stage,&#160;be identified to&#160;species&#160;on any presumption of range or habitat. In&#160;North-east India the genus is well distributed all over, with most records taken to be this species including animals observed in Manas NP, north(west) of the Brahmaputra (Choudhury 2013).

Occurrence seems to be patchy, with no recent records from the Mekong plain, which covers most of the western part of the southern half of the country (e.g., Duckworth 1997, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Johnson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b).&#160;<br/><br/>Roberton (2007) traced confirmed field records for the genus, all assumed to be Greater Hog Badger, from most of Viet Nam, occurrence was patchy and no records were found for the Mekong Delta. The current distribution in Viet Nam is likely to be highly fragmented.&#160;A recent review of small carnivore camera-trap records failed to produce any records&#160;additional&#160;to those in&#160;Roberton (2007), despite several surveys within suitable habitat, and within&#160;some of the country's largest&#160;protected areas (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3). As of mid 2014, only two camera-trap records were&#160;known&#160;for the entire country (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014), from Pu Mat Nature Reserve&#160;(SFNC 2000) and Pu Luong NR (Do Ngoc Cuong 2004). The species has&#160;subsequently&#160;been camera-trapped in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve, Kon Tum province (Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Although there were few historical Cambodian records, camera-trapping has recently found it at various sites spread almost throughout the country (e.g. Holden and Neang 2009, Royan 2010, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a), including Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Seima Protected Forest (WCS Cambodia unpublished data per D.H.A.

In Lao PDR, the palatability of this hog badger varies between ethnic groups, with some groups disliking the taste, whereas groups in parts of the Nam Theun basin (and presumably elsewhere) esteem the species as food (J.P. Baker pers. comm. to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, J. Chamberlain per. comm. to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). The genus, presumably including this species, is also eaten by some groups in India (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006), and is hunted as well as farmed for food in China (M.W.N. Lao pers. comm. 2006). Across most of its range, most of the catch is probably not targeted, but is by non-selective methods for wildlife meat, or opportunistically during activities other than hunting.",Terrestrial,"Throughout its range, Greater Hog Badger is found in a number of protected areas, perhaps particularly in Myanmar, India and Thailand (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2008, Choudhury 2013, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). This species is protected by law in Thailand (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014), in Bangladesh (as a Schedule 1 species) under the Wildlife Act 2012 (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014), and in India, under the highest level of protection (Choudhury 2013). This species is not protected in Viet Nam or Cambodia and is the largest-bodied unprotected mammal, except for Eurasian Wild Hog <em>Sus scrofa</em>, in Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008).

45220097,41707,Viverra megaspila,Endangered,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Large-spotted Civet is listed as Endangered because of an ongoing and projected future population decline, of more than 50% over three generations (taken to be 15 years) in the past and the future, inferred from range-wide over-exploitation and habitat destruction, and the interaction between these factors (hunting has more serious effects in fragmented landscapes), coupled with some evidence of range shrinkage (the lack of records from the northern extremity, China, since 1998; and the paucity of post-1990 records in the country elsewhere in its range with the heaviest hunting and habitat conversion, Viet Nam). Its main land-type of occurrence, level lowland, is also the main one sought for conversion to agriculture, infrastructure and settlement, driving therefore much faster declines than are seen in species otherwise similar but which occur widely in hill and mountain forest. In countries other than Cambodia, potentially Myanmar, and perhaps parts of Thailand, it is reduced to small isolated populations, many of which may have poor long-term prospects because suitable habitat is restricted in each area to small peripheral parts.&#160;The 2008 assessment, as Vulnerable, stressed the difficulty of determining the population loss rates through habitat and hunting. It noted specifically that ""if strong forest protection activities are implemented in Cambodia this [Vulnerable] will need revision. Conversely, this assessment may be overly optimistic ... better data might even indicate EN [Endangered] status"". Forest conversion rates in lowland Cambodia have indeed outstripped those predicted at the last assessment, with major incursion into even some formerly flagship protected areas. The regionally strengthening economy suggests that deforestation rates will continue to rise in Cambodia, and the rising level of external investment into Myanmar with the easing of economic sanctions guarantees rapid rates of conversion of level lowlands there (areas which are mostly not so far surveyed for the species). Trade-driven hunting, particularly cable-snaring, which is likely to have caused the declines of a large suite of ground-dwelling mammals in Viet Nam and other range states, is reported to be on the increase in several protected areas in Cambodia. Thus, while information is too imprecise to be sure that the species might not more appropriately be categorised as Vulnerable, Critically Endangered is also a possibility.","Several examinations of records over varying geographic scales have concluded that Large-spotted Civet is basically a lowland species, with records over 300 m a.s.l. relatively unusual and almost confined to areas of level or gentle terrain (Duckworth 1997, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, Jennings and Veron 2011, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is camera-trapped in large numbers in some areas, without the use of special techniques (Austin 1999, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, Jenks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014); this allows high confidence that the extreme paucity of records from above 600 m and from hilly terrain above 300 m, despite extensive camera-trapping in most range states in such areas, truly reflects a great rarity of Large-spotted Civet at these altitudes. Nonetheless, Large-spotted Civet has occasionally been found much higher. Some such records (e.g. Kon Ka Kinh, Viet Nam; probably within 700-900 m; Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005) come from areas of mid-altitude plateau terrain, which also support other predominantly lowland species. The highest precise-altitude record is perhaps a camera-trap record in 2010 from interior Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, at 780 m; this area had been heavily camera-trapped over the preceding decade without finding the species and its occurrence so high is evidently exceptional (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Within suitable altitude and terrain, the species has been recorded in a number of different habitats: natural habitats assigned directly by observers include evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, deciduous dipterocarp forest, <em>Melaleuca</em>-dominated swamp-forest, shrubland, wetlands and grassland. There are many records from degraded and edge areas as well as some from well within little-encroached blocks of habitat (Duckworth 1997, Austin 1999, Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Holden and Neang 2009, Jenks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Records from plantations (oil palm, teak and perhaps others) seem to come typically or invariably from close to natural habitat (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015).<br/><br/>Two recent investigations of habitat use, one (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010) for two parts of Cambodia, the other (Jennings and Veron 2011) across the species's non-Chinese range, assigned habitats from record coordinates and GIS habitat information, rather than directly by the surveyors. Both concluded the species is primarily one of deciduous forest. While there are many records of Large-spotted Civet from deciduous forest, there are also many from evergreen forest (see above) and, considering patterns of camera-trapping across habitats at altitudes below 300-400 m, it is certainly not, across its range, preferentially associated with deciduous forest.<br/><br/>Jennings and Veron (2011) provided no measure of relative survey effort between different habitat types, thus allowing the possibility that patterns of record distribution that they identified reflect patterns of survey distribution as much as or more than of animal distribution. Their habitat information source [Global Land Cover 2000 map for Southeast Asia (www.bioval.jrc.ec.europa.eu/products/glc2000/products.php; map 6)], was examined independently by J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Tizard (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;for areas of southern Lao PDR, Cambodia and adjacent Viet Nam with which they were familiar. Across much of the southern Indochinese lowlands, predominantly deciduous landscapes have strips of semi-evergreen forest along&#160;many&#160;rivers and patches on hill tops. Many of these were not, on the GLC map, distinguished from the surrounding deciduous matrix. Jennings and Veron's (2011) analysis cannot, therefore, determine the degree of evergreen versus deciduous habitat use in this large three-country area, and it is plausible that similar imprecision is present in the map for other plains biomes with extensive but not total deciduous forest. These evergreen forest patches and strips support some birds typical of evergreen forest and not of deciduous forest&#160;J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Tizard pers. comm. 2010); the same may be true of mammals although at least with carnivores this is less readily assessed.<br/><br/>Gray <em>et al</em>. (2010) used an apparently more precise source for habitats, and were able to build in some at least implicit measure of relative effort. It is therefore possible that in these two areas Large-spotted Civet is particularly associated with deciduous forest. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the apparent association may be an artefact if taken to be applicable across the&#160;species's range. The primary confounding variable is that terrain types on which deciduous dipterocarp and semi-evergreen forest occur within the Mondulkiri Protected Forest are significantly different. Semi-evergreen forest is primarily associated with rocky hill terrain (albeit at low elevation) in which slope angles and soil characteristics are unlike typical plains level semi-evergreen forest as occurs elsewhere in Cambodia and other parts of the species's range. In Mondulkiri PF, camera-trapping in semi-evergreen forest appears to have been located&#160;only&#160;in such hilly terrain. Such semi-evergreen forest might be ‘avoided’by Large-spotted Civet as a result of terrain type rather than vegetation type; whereas the deciduous forests in this areas are on gentle terrain as is typically occupied by this civet (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). That there may be significant undetermined factors driving the local-scale distribution of Large-spotted Civet in areas surveyed by Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) is suggested by the marked paucity of records from Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary compared with Mondulkiri PF. Although the habitats in these two areas are broadly similar, there are noticeable although somewhat subtle differences. Although Phnom Prich WS has a greater proportion of highly deciduous semi-evergreen forest (sometimes called mixed deciduous forest; poorly categorised and delineated on the JICA landcover maps) than does Mondulkiri PF, other differences suggest this factor alone may not be the most significant one in the apparent differences in <em>Viverra</em> civet occurrence data. Phnom Prich WS is on somewhat more rugged terrain than is Mondulkiri PF, especially when the camera-trap regions are compared (in part this may have some correlation with semi-evergreen forest/ highly deciduous semi-evergreen forest presence). Furthermore, deciduous dipterocarp forest differs between the two areas quite substantially: Phnom Prich WS has a much lower proportion of relatively open deciduous dipterocarp forest, and especially open ‘glades’, and a much higher proportion of the deciduous dipterocarp forest has an understorey dominated by small bamboo. Water sources are markedly fewer and more aggregated in Phnom Prich WS. Unless there was some bias in the camera-trapping protocol and camera placement, which is hard to imagine given the large numbers of Large Indian Civet <em>V. zibetha</em> detected, the paucity of Large-spotted Civet records from Phnom Prich WS suggests that the species may be relatively sensitive to further as yet unknown habitat characteristics.<br/><br/>Chutipong <em>et al</em>. (2014) intended also&#160;to assess the species's habitat use in Thailand by GIS, but the habitat types generated for the records, when checked by the original surveyors, produced far too many gross errors of classification for the method to be viable; this included the failure to distinguish between evergreen gallery forest and the surrounding extensive grassy deciduous dipterocarp forest, and multiple instances of semi-natural habitats being classed as plantations (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). Instead, R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014), in conjunction with the surveyors, inspected the locations by eye. In Thailand, there is no suggestion of an association with deciduous forest over evergreen. This analysis of Thai records again suggests&#160;that the species may have an even more restricted niche than was&#160;previously thought. Although there is wide occurrence across Thailand, detection rates, especially the proportions of camera-trap stations with detections, are very low in almost all areas (in eight of the nine sites with detections, fewer than five camera-trap stations found the species). At Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary, the only site with extensive lowland gentle terrain, the species was detected at 41 camera stations. Plotting the locations of all Thai Large-spotted Civet detections on terrain maps placed almost all records unequivocally on gentle terrain, mostly at the edges of protected areas that are centred on hill or mountainous terrain. One of the best examples of this is Khao Yai Natonal Park, which has had some of the most intensive camera-trapping in Thailand, yet Large-spotted Civet has been detected at only three camera-trap stations: two on low elevation, very gentle terrain at the very edge of the park, and a third at 780 m in more rugged terrain amid the main research area in the park with very high levels of camera-trapping in many years: it is clear that Large-spotted Civet does not occur regularly in that sector. Vegetation association in Thailand is less clear, for two main reasons: most low-elevation gentle terrain habitat is significantly degraded (mostly perhaps secondary) and to a degree fragmented; secondly it appears that little to no deciduous or largely deciduous low-elevation gentle terrain habitat survives in the camera-trap survey areas (indeed, such habitat is now rare in Thailand). Thus, there is no way to compare occurrence between semi-evergreen/evergreen and deciduous habitats, or intact with degraded and fragmented habitats. The Thai data suggest a possible greater association with mosaics of different habitats, but this might simply be an artefact of the habitat types present and camera-trapping procedures.&#160;An additional survey not included in Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2014) or the foregoing, of Huai Kha Khaeng&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Wongchoo 2014), detected Large-spotted Civet at few camera-trap stations. These were all in deciduous forest, but in this site evergreen forest is very localised below 400 m and nearly all camera-trapping was in deciduous forest; analysis suggested low altitude, not forest-type, best explained the distribution of the species in the survey area.<br/><br/>There has been no investigation of diet, ranging, productivity or other aspects of natural history, all of which, particularly if compared across habitats, might usefully inform conservation planning and implementation for this species.","Throughout much of Large-spotted Civet's range, ground-dwelling small carnivores are exposed to heavy hunting, particularly with snares and dogs. Some level of hunting pressure is likely to be almost universal. A rapid, ongoing expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam and China is in part driven by illegal trade in timber, wild meat and other forest resources, and by large infrastructure projects. This social change has driven a recent massive increase in demand for wildlife as luxury food in urban centres, particularly in China and Viet Nam; civets are a large part of this (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is no evidence that Large-spotted Civet is specifically sought (nor that it is eschewed); it is safe to assume that it comprises part of the general off-take, given that most methods are of low selectivity, such as lines of snares suitable for animals of this size class set at high density with drift fences (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving wildlife-meat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In many countries, the species's habitat use means that in many forest blocks it occurs mostly round the margins (lowlands) with the interior (often mostly hill forest) being unsuitable. This may insulate it to some extent from the worst of industrial snaring, because the peripheral areas are mostly already defaunated of high market-value species. Set against this, it is more likely in these areas to be encountered during general subsistence forest resource-gathering activities (e.g., firewood, food for domestic consumption, construction materials); people engaging in these are in many areas invariably accompanied by dogs, carrying guns and alert for any opportunistic hunting possibility for animals of this size-class and over. Of its current range states, Cambodia and, presumably, Myanmar both have multiple large protected areas comprising extensive areas at suitable altitude and terrain for this species. This gives more solid long-term options, but few of these are effectively managed at present, and hunting in some is known to be at very high levels.<br/><br/>Hunting is compounded by habitat loss. From the 1970s and the 1990s, large areas of lowland forest were converted to agriculture across parts the species's range, particularly in China, Thailand and Viet Nam (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Roberton 2007, Wang Ying-xiang pers. comm. 2006). Large areas were also logged and otherwise encroached. While this might well have had little direct effect on suitability for Large-spotted Civet, heavy hunting almost invariably accompanies such operations. Post-logging, the typically increased accessibility and fragmentation of habitat increases the threat of hunting and the negative effects on susceptible species (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005). While large-scale conversion of the small remaining tracts of lowland forest has mostly slowed in these countries since the 1990s, Lao PDR and, in particular, Cambodia are still within their main phase of conversion; and political and thus economic changes in Myanmar suggest the start of a similar upsurge there. Cambodia is presently seeing massive deforestation of the lowlands, particularly for local and plantation-scale agriculture; this is unquestionably reducing the extent of suitable habitat for Large-spotted Civet both outside and inside protected areas (T.N.E. Gray&#160;&#160;pers. comm. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). In Myanmar, there is a major trend in conversion of forest to plant oil agriculture, particularly in lowlands (J.W. Duckworth and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006).","Recent camera-trapping in many areas within Large-spotted Civet's geographic range has greatly clarified its population status. The following comments are made in the light of survey effort in suitable habitat (forested gentle terrain below 300 m, exceptionally to 500 m or more; see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in each country.<br/><br/>Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) generated no records in extensive surveys across Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan, southern China, and were aware of none this century. It is possible that Large-spotted Civet has been extirpated from China.<br/><br/>Roberton (2007) traced only nine confirmed records from Viet Nam, only two of which were since 1990. Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2012) collated camera-trap records from across Viet Nam and found only two records: U Minh Thuong National Park (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004) and Yok Don National Park (Eames <em>et al</em>. 2004). Subsequent small carnivore-focused surveys in the U Minh <em>Melalueca</em>-dominated wetlands failed to record the species, as have similar surveys in lowland habitats e.g. the Ke Go-Khe Net Lowlands and Cat Tien National Park (Save Viet Nam’s Wildlife pers. comm. 2014). Large-spotted Civet is now evidently very rare in Viet Nam and is probably very close to national extinction if not gone already; most natural lowland habitats in Viet Nam have been converted into agriculture, and what is under protection is known or can be assumed to suffer from intense trade-driven hunting.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Duckworth (1994) and Austin (1999) found the species easily in both areas of suitable habitat surveyed with suitable methodology in the early 1990s, Phou Xang He and Xe Pian National Protected Areas. There has been little subsequent survey in habitat potentially suitable for the species since then, with most conservation activity occurring in hilly areas (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014). Of two incidental records since 2000, one was adjacent to one of the earlier areas, Xe Pian NPA (Duckworth 2008) and one was some distance from other records, on the Nakai plateau; although this animal was seen in trade, it is unlikely it had been brought from afar (Khounboline 2005). Subsequent survey of the plateau by camera-trap (Dersu 2008) and the rounding up of animals isolated by the filling of the Nakai dam (U. Streicher pers. comm. 2010) did not find the species, indicating that it was probably even then extremely rare there. The suitable habitat on the plateau has now been flooded. Intense trade-driven hunting and fragmentation of remaining lowland natural and semi-natural habitat across Lao PDR, in an environment of highly uneven law enforcement, suggests that the Lao population is likely now to be very low. Although many areas of terrain and habitat potentially holding the species remain and have not been appropriately surveyed (see, e.g., SUFORD 2010), these are mostly outside the protected area system and are heavily hunted; the likelihood of Lao PDR still holding a large undiscovered population of Large-spotted Civet is very low (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>A compilation of camera-trap records from 21 survey areas in Thailand found Large-spotted Civet records in nine of them. In most of these areas, however, suitable habitat is of limited extent and is mostly around the margins; populations are likely to be low. Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary stands out as by far the largest area of suitable habitat surveyed; most of the camera-trap stations recording the species anywhere in the country were in this protected area (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Away from this single protected areas, populations are likely mostly to be small. Based on habitat and terrain, it is unlikely that any areas holding large populations of the species remain to be discovered in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Cambodia is likely to hold the largest population of any range state except perhaps Myanmar. Suitable terrain is widespread. Much of it is still forested, although ongoing clearance imuch of it is still forested rapid. North-east Cambodia, with various protected areas, may be particularly important, notably the protected areas of the 'Eastern Plains Landscape', in particular Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2014), as might be the ‘Northern Plains’ west of the Mekong (WCS Cambodia pers. comm. 2014). There are also records from gentle terrain around the Cardamom mountains (Holden and Neang 2009). The country’s population is not secure though and a possible, probably hunting-driven, decline has been noted for Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014). Large-spotted Civet was the third most commonly&#160;camera-trapped small carnivore species in the northern plains during the 2013–2014 dry season (Ai Suzuki pers. comm. 2014). Hunting, particularly snaring, remains relatively less prevalent in the Northern Plains than in other Cambodian protected areas, particularly those that border Viet Nam, e.g. the Eastern Plains Landscape, which includes Mondulkiri Protected Forest. It is plausible that the country’s most significant and important population is now in the Northern Plains (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Myanmar there are only a few records, from only a few sites (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Based on the extent of habitat on suitable terrain, many areas of habitat potentially suitable for Large-spotted Civet, including some large tracts, have not been surveyed by methodology appropriate to find the species (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Generalised trade-driven hunting for ground-dwelling mammals is generally less pervasive than in Vietnam and Lao PDR. In combination, these factors suggest that Myanmar might retain populations comparable to or exceeding those in Cambodia.<br/><br/>There seem to be only two series of recent records from Malaysia: these are from (i) two camera-trap stations in an oil palm plantation, and (ii) a road-kill record, all at the fringes of the Bintang-Hijau Range in the north-west of the country; the region is within the known range as clarified by Jennings and Veron (2011) (Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015).<br/><br/>As a ground-dwelling species, Large-spotted Civet is presumably readily snared. Thus, examination of markets is relevant to assessing the status of source populations. Despite the massive levels of non-specific hunting and of civet trade, and the often-taken opportunities to check large numbers of civets in trade, Large-spotted Civet has not recorded in the widespread trade in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) or Viet Nam, which suggests that the populations are already reduced to overall extremely low levels in these countries (S.I. Roberton, Wang Y.-x., Nguyen X.D. and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2006). Cambodia and Lao PDR both retain&#160;extensive (although fast-shrinking) degraded, heavily hunted lowland forest (large areas of Attapu, Salavan and Savannakhet provinces in Lao PDR, and of Kratie, Kompong Thom, and Stung Treng provinces in Cambodia) outside protected areas. The extent to which Large-spotted Civet persists&#160;within these non-protected areas is unknown. The insidious hunting throughout these landscapes (despite the occasional persistence of scattered populations of threatened species e.g. Eld’s Deer&#160;<em>Rucervus eldii</em>, White-shouldered Ibis&#160;<em>Pseudibis davisonii</em>), is likely to have caused declines in Large-spotted Civet as of most ground-dwelling mammals of similar and larger size. In addition, the widespread clearance of lowland forests for industrial agricultural concessions in Cambodia, both within and outside protected areas, will be reducing the extent of available habitat.<br/><br/>Throughout the twentieth century it is safe to infer an enormous decline in the species's global population, particularly in Thailand and Viet Nam, countries with large areas of suitable terrain which, during that century, were extensively converted to agriculture. This process proceeded somewhat later in the relatively smaller areas in Lao PDR. Cambodia has retained such a large proportion of the global total population in part by its large area of suitable terrain, but in particular because of the restraining effect of decades of civil unrest upon large-scale land conversion. With the stability since the late 1990s, such change is now proceeding apace. Similarly, Myanmar is emerging from a long period of international political sanctions that have held back finance for large-scale conversion of potentially suitable agricultural land; such activity is now gathering speed, particularly in the level lowlands (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, R.J. Tizard pers. comm. 2014). As well as habitat conversion, trends in hunting are relevant to inferring the population trend of this species. As a mobile (i.e. non-ambush predator) ground-dwelling species, Large-spotted Civet is presumably strongly susceptible to snaring. From the 1990s onwards, snaring levels have risen hugely across Viet Nam, Lao PDR and increasingly elsewhere, such as eastern Cambodia. While large areas of land in many range states have been declared protected areas, in most countries (notably excepting Cambodia) these are somewhat to greatly concentrated in hilly regions inimical to this species. Enforcement of wildlife laws is extremely lax in much of the species's range, and particularly outside high-profile protected areas. Thus, although there is no monitoring programme of this species directly, it is safe to infer from habitat and off-take trends that it has been in steep decline for decades and that this is ongoing.",Decreasing,"Large-spotted Civet has been found in southern China (e.g., Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010), Cambodia (e.g., Holden and Neang 2009, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2014), Lao PDR (e.g., Duckworth 1997, Austin 1999, Khounboline 2005), Peninsular Malaysia (e.g., Jennings and Veron 2011, Hamirul <em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015), Myanmar (e.g., Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008), Thailand (e.g., Lynam&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenks &#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and Viet Nam (e.g., Eames&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Nguyen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Roberton 2007). There was considerable confusion during the twentieth century about the southern extent of Large-spotted Civet occurrence, stemming in part from at least one author's treatment of <em>V. megaspila</em> and Malay Civet <em>V. tangalunga</em> as synonymous; Large-spotted Civet's documented range in Peninsular Malaysia is limited to the north-west of the country (Jennings and Veron 2011,&#160;Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015) and there are no records from Singapore (Chua <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>There are recent (post 1995) records from multiple localities in most range states, except for China, Viet Nam and Malaysia. In China the last record was in 1998 (Wang Ying-xiang pers. comm. 2006); Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) stated only that it might survive in the country. In Malaysia it has recently been found at only two localities, in the north-west and within the validated former range (Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015). In Viet Nam, apparently the only confirmed record since 2003 is&#160;of two captives&#160;photographed near Takou Nature Reserve (in which they were reportedly captured) in 2010 (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). The distribution in most countries is now patchy, reflecting its habitat use (see 'Habitats and ecology'&#160;section) and the heavy conversion of these habitats (see 'Threats'&#160;section).<br/><br/>It has been recorded from sea-level to about 800 m a.s.l., although it is very scarce above about 500 m and occurs predominantly below 300 m (see 'Habitats and ecology'&#160;section).","Much of the species's range, particularly Viet Nam and Lao PDR but increasingly other areas, has seen very heavy market-driven hunting using often non-selective methods such snaring. This is resulting in huge declines and, evidently, widespread local extirpations of many ground-dwelling mammals (e.g., Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, there has been an increased demand for civets as luxury food in Chinese and Viet Namese markets (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005). Although there has been no specific assessment of the extent to which Large-spotted Civet is taken, it is likely to be neither positively sought nor actively avoided. W. Chutipong (pers. comm. 2014) saw in an internet video of civet-coffee farming in Thailand a Large-spotted Civet; whether the animal was part of the coffee processing operations or was simply a quirky trophy-pet was not clear.",Terrestrial,"Large-spotted Civet has been found in many protected areas, particularly in Thailand and Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Most of these are not well managed, with some level of hunting, and many comprise largely unsuitable terrain and altitude for the species. Some of the PAs supporting it in Cambodia are afforded high ranking in conservation prioritisation, notably Mondulkiri Protected Forest, and Gray <em>et al</em>. (2010) called for Large-spotted Civet to be given specific consideration in management of this area. The species is nominally legally protected in most or all range states (excepting China, apparently), but these laws are widely flouted and over large parts of the species's present range have no deterrent effect on hunting levels. Recent great reductions in gun usage by civilians for hunting in Lao PDR and perhaps other countries have led to increased snaring efforts (in compensation); the latter is probably the more damaging form of hunting for this species (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The overwhelming need is to secure multiple protected areas across its range by reducing hunting and habitat encroachment to levels not detrimental to this species. A firm legal basis already exists to do this in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar. Such PAs should include Khao Ang Rue Nai WS and, perhaps, Huai Kha Khaeng WS, Thailand (the latter already one of the best-protected areas in South-east Asia; the former not), Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Preah Vihear Protected Forest (Cambodia), some in Myanmar (currently with too little information to decide which), and perhaps Xe Pian NPA in Lao PDR (although recent information is lacking and regional trends suggest it is quite likely the species will now be very rare there).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Because it occupies habitats that are very arid that will not support most development without the availability of water, there are no known threats to the vast majority of the habitats occupied by the Karoo Round-eared Sengi. Areas close to rivers or reliable sources of water may have been developed, or may be developed in the future, as agricultural and urban areas. For example, a narrow area adjacent to and along the Orange River between Namibia and South Africa has been developed, but this is a relatively small area compared to the overall distribution of the Karoo Round-eared Sengi. Relatively small areas also may be impacted by mineral extraction activities, such as around the town of Springbok in South Africa and north along the coast towards the border. Again, this disturbance is confined to a relatively small area compared to the overall distribution of the species. Past, current, and future development in this region of Africa is not expected to have a significant impact on this sengi or its habitats. However, a number of wind and solar farms are proposed throughout the distribution of the species in South Africa and the potential displacement impacts of these renewable energy facilities should be monitored. On the other hand, bush encroachment and desertification, especially related to localized intensive goat and sheep grazing, might adversely alter habitats that these sengis occupy, and these processes should be monitored for possible negative impacts on sengi populations. The species is therefore listed as Least Concern.","The Karoo Round-eared Sengi is a habitat specialist, which occupies gravel plains associated with alluvial plains and relatively flat areas between higher elevation areas such as outcrops, scarps, hills, and mountains (Corbet and Hanks 1968; Rathbun 2005, 2009). These areas, which can vary from hard gravel to looser sandy soils, are sparsely vegetated with bunch grasses and widely spaced small bushes (Kerley 1992, Dumbacher <em>et al.</em> 2012, Perrin and Rathbun 2013). Densities range between 0.4 and 1.6 individuals per hectare, and home range areas tend to be overlapping by a male and female, with male home ranges tending to be larger than those of females (Schubert 2011). Unlike <em>M. flavicaudatus</em>, this species does not seem to use or maintain long, straight trails composed of small oval bare spots like reported for <em>M</em>. <em>flavicaudatus&#160;</em>(Sauer and Sauer 1972, Dumbacher <em>et al. </em>2012). Smit <em>et al.</em> (2009) indicate that the genetic structure within the species is mostly a pattern of isolation-by-distance, typical of a species with a continuous rather than clustered distribution. &#160;For a comprehensive list of research publications, see the searchable bibliography at <a href=""http://www.sengis.org"">www.sengis.org</a>.","There are no known major threats to the species. Habitat modification to relatively small areas may occur near rivers and human population centres due to small-holder and industrial agriculture, mineral extraction, and urban development. Changes in habitats due to desertification and bush encroachment and proposed wind and solar energy facilities may adversely alter habitats for sengis and displace them from such areas, but at present these changes do not appear widespread or serious, especially since the species is associated with arid habitats to begin with.","It is believed that over much of its range its numbers are relatively low (Corbet and Hanks 1968, Rathbun 2005, Smit <em>et al.</em> 2009, Schubert 2011, Dumbacher <em>et al.</em> 2012, Perrin and Rathbun 2013).

Another recent decline of approximately 70% in a large part of the species’ range (Yellow Sea, Korea) provides an index of decline (subcriterion b) that may apply throughout many unsurveyed portions of the range. Although the rate of decline in such areas can only be inferred, there is no evidence that threats differ substantially. The scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (45 years; Moore 2015) (A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4). The factor most responsible for such decline is incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d), but the loss and degradation of habitat (including chemical pollution; subcriteria c and e) and vessel strikes (at least in the Yangtze River system; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013) are contributing factors as well. The primary causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population size—bycatch in fishing gear and mortality from vessel strikes (both interpreted here as “exploitation”), decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollution—have not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.<br/><br/>As the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission concluded after a review of the species (at the time with no recognized species-level distinction between <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) in 2005 (IWC 2006), “human populations adjacent to the Finless Porpoise’s habitat are increasing in size and becoming more industrialised so the expectation should be that anthropogenic pressures will continue and intensify.” None of the threats has been seriously addressed or mitigated in any part of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise’s range, even though threat levels are likely increasing. Partly because of their small size, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994). Incidental mortality in fishing gear is either known or presumed to occur throughout the range of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, IWC 2006).<br/><br/>There is clear evidence of a declining trend in three major parts of this species’ range. In the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, a decline of nearly 70% was estimated over a period of 22 years, from 1976-1978 to 1999-2000 (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002, also see Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). There is also evidence of a rapid decline in recent decades in the Yangtze River and adjoining lake systems of China (Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2008, Wang 2009, Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2012) with a 60% decline in the six years between 2006 and 2012 (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2014); the subspecies there (<em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em>) was classified as Endangered in 1996 and uplisted to Critically Endangered in 2013 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2013). Finally, there is recent evidence suggesting a decline of approximately 70% in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in the Korean portion of the Yellow Sea between the early 2000s and 2011 (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015), and there is no reason to believe this decline has been reversed.<br/><br/>There is sufficient information for separate assessment of at least two threatened subpopulations – the subpopulation in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, which likely qualifies for Endangered or Critically Endangered (Hashimoto et al. 2015), and the Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Japan) subpopulation, which likely qualifies for at least Vulnerable (Hashimoto et al. 2015).<br/><p></p>","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, possibly mangrove swamps, estuaries, and some large rivers. However, they can also occur in shallow waters (&lt;200 m deep) quite far from shore (up to 240 km). They appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In Japanese waters, Finless Porpoises prefer shallow depths (&lt;50 m) and close proximity to the shore (&lt;5 km). In the shallow East China Sea, proximity to the shore does not appear to be as important (Amano 2009). </p>  Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range.</p>  <p>In Japan, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises become entangled in a variety of types of fishing gear (Amano 2009). Changes in fishing methods and the use of acoustic deterrents may have reduced the incidental catch in some areas such as western Kyushu (Kasuya 1999, Amano <em>et al.</em> 2017), but substantial numbers are still being taken in gillnets and other fishing gear. A total of 114 specimens were collected in Japan during 1985–1992 from western and north-eastern Kyushu including parts of the western Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 1993): 84 (73%) of them had been killed incidentally in fisheries, 25 had been found dead on the beach or in the sea, and there was no information on the other five. Fishing gears that killed the 84 porpoises were bottom-set gillnets (58), surface gillnets (17), trap nets (7), trawl nets (1) and drifting (ghost) nets (1). Such fishing gears are common in Japan and probably kill Finless Porpoises off other coasts, although usually such catches go unreported. Shirakihara and Shirakihara (2013) estimated 238-270 Finless Porpoises are bycaught annually in Ariake Sound and Tachibana Bay.</p>  <p>In Korea (information is available only from the Republic of Korea), an official reporting system implemented in 2011 resulted in a count of 2,107 Finless Porpoises bycaught inshore, mainly along the west coast, in 2012 (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although reporting apparently has improved, there is still assumed to be substantial under-reporting for the following reasons according to Park <em>et al</em>. (2015): “First, each Finless Porpoise caught in a fish­ing net costs approximately $100 (100,000 Wons) [<em>sic</em>]. Therefore, the dead porpoise can be discarded because it has no signifi­cant value. Second, the bycatch of Finless Porpoises is usually reported only in large harbours, with deaths in smaller ports seldom reported (Kim <em>et al</em>., 2013). Therefore, it is likely that the impact of the bycatch of Finless Porpoises on its population is underestimated.”</p>  <p>Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the waters of western Taiwan, including the Matsu and Chinmen Islands (western Taiwan Strait), a considerable number of Finless Porpoises are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters (e.g., Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999), there are serious concerns about the level of bycatch of both Finless Porpoise species. Illegal electric fishing became widespread in the Yangtze River during the 1990s, and it may kill porpoises outright and certainly contributes to the depletion of their prey (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2000).</p>  <p>In some parts of their range, there is an aversion to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data). However, there is a long history of porpoises taken incidentally being sold for human consumption in at least some parts of Japan (e.g., Mizue <em>et al.</em> 1965) and on the Korean peninsula (IWC 2000). According to M. Amano (pers. comm.), consumption of Finless Porpoises no longer occurs in Japan. An analysis of the species composition of odontocete products in Korean markets during 2003–2004 estimated that the true catch of Finless Porpoises in Korean waters during this period was probably about four times the officially reported catch of 142 animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/> <br/> As coastal and riverine animals, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming and rampant harbour (and other) development throughout East Asia means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Porpoise habitat in the Yangtze River system has been degraded by water development, including the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams and about 1,300 smaller dams in tributaries (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2000). Sand mining is intensive in Poyang Lake, until recently a stronghold for Yangtze Finless Porpoises (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). Sand mining is also thought to have played a significant role in the severe decline of Finless Porpoises in the central and eastern Seto Inland Sea, Japan (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Kannan <em>et al</em>. 1989, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1995; Le <em>et al</em>. 1999, Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). A mass die-off of at least 249 Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises along the Saemangeum dike area of the western Korean Peninsula was reported by Park <em>et al.</em> (2012) who speculated that the cause was unusually low temperatures. However, there have been news reports of large (&gt;100) kills of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in local coastal fisheries, so it may be difficult to rule out human activities as a causal factor in such large-scale die-offs.</p>  <p>A survey of levels and drivers of human-caused mortality carried out in 27 fishing settlements along the middle-lower Yangtze channel identified three main categories of observed porpoise deaths: (1) interaction with fishing gear, (2) vessel strikes, and (3) unknown cause (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013). A total of 344 dated porpoise mortality events directly observed by informants between 1950 and 2008 were reported, including 75 porpoise deaths from 1989–1998 and 147 from 1999–2008. This apparent increase was said to be driven by the greater number of deaths attributed to vessel strikes (19 to 35) and unknown causes (31 to 94) in the more recent decade. Comparison of the reported mortality with the estimated abundance suggests that the fraction of individuals removed from the declining porpoise population in the Yangtze had quadrupled over the course of two decades. Turvey <em>et al</em>. concluded that entanglement in rolling hook long-lines was probably responsible for the greatest number of porpoise deaths in fishing gear and that vessel strikes and other anthropogenic factors, such as electrofishing, had become the dominant and increasing causes of mortality in the Yangtze.</p>  The causes of an apparent decline in Finless Porpoise numbers in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan are not fully understood, but include incidental mortality in fisheries as well as various forms of habitat degradation (IWC 2000, 2006). Parts of the coastal regions of the Inland Sea are highly developed and industrialized, so the associated threats of habitat loss (e.g., from reclamation and sand mining) and pollution are suspected to have had some (undetermined) level of impact (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 2002).","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (IWC 2006). Estimates from the early 2000s are available for five subpopulations in Japanese waters, distinguished on the basis of skull morphology and mtDNA variability (Yoshida <em>et al.</em> 1995, Yoshida 2002), as follows: 3,807 (coefficient of variation (CV) 16%) in Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 289 (CV 19%) in Omura Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 3,743 (CV 24%) in Ise/Mikawa Bay (Yoshida 2002); 3,387 (CV 33%) in Chiba/Sendai Bay (Amano <em>et al</em>. 2003); and 7,572 (CV 17%) in the Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Most of the estimates were summarized in IWC (2006). For the Inland Sea subpopulation, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. (2002) recorded a decline in sighting rate of 18-100% for 18 tracklines surveyed in 1976–78 and again in 1999–2000. The declines for 11 of the tracklines were statistically significant. Using abundance indices calculated by multiplying the density indices (no. individuals/cruise distance) and area size of each stratum, an overall decline of 69% is inferred over the 22 years between the two sets of surveys (T. Kasuya pers. comm. 2007, data from Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/> <br/> Surveys in western Korean waters (Yellow Sea) in the early 2000s estimated 21,532 (CV 39%) Finless Porpoises in offshore waters and 5,464 (CV 20%) in inshore waters (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) considered these estimates to be negatively biased (IWC 2006). More recent surveys resulted in density estimates of 0.122 individuals/km<span class=""A78"">² (offshore) and 0.151 ind./km² (inshore), both much lower than the corresponding estimates from surveys in 2004 (offshore, 0.565 ind./km²) and 2005 (inshore, 0.638 ind./km²) (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015). Park <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that these results indicated a decline in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in this region of approximately 70% between 2004/2005 and 2011.<br/> <br/> Based on surveys from 1984 to 1991, Zhang <em>et al</em>. (1993) estimated that there were about 2,700 porpoises in the Yangtze River, while Zhou <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated that only 700 remained in the lower reaches between Nanjing and Hukou between 1989 and 1992. Wang <em>et al</em>. (2000) concluded that Finless Porpoise abundance in the Yangtze River had declined considerably and that there could be fewer than 2,000 animals (although this was not based on a rigorous assessment). A two-vessel survey of the Yangtze mainstem in 2006 yielded an estimate of 1,225 (CV 0.13) which, when combined with earlier estimates for Poyang and Dongting Lakes, was interpreted as implying an overall number of about 1,800 in the Yangtze system (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). In some portions of the river where porpoises had been reported to be present in the past, none were seen during the 2006 survey (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2012). Previous estimates of the annual rate of decline of Yangtze Finless Porpoises varied from 5 to 7.3% (see Wang 2009 for a review). However, a survey of the mainstem Yangtze in 2012 determined that only approximately 500 porpoises remained (Mei <em>et al.</em> 2014), indicating a roughly 60% decline in the main river in six years. However, Yangtze River cetacean surveys have been plagued by variable methods and coverage, and therefore decline rates must be viewed with some level of caution.<br/> <br/> There are no abundance estimates for Finless Porpoises in Chinese marine waters other than Hong Kong (IWC 2006), which in any event refer to for <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and not <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The type specimen was from the Yangtze River, Kiangsu [=Jiangsu] Province, China, ~129 km (80 miles) northwest of Shanghai (Pilleri and Gihr 1972).<br/> <br/> In general, this species occurs in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal water around the western Pacific Ocean from the Taiwan Strait to the waters of northern China, Korea and northern Honshu, Japan. (Note that a Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise was discovered recently in the waters of Okinawa Island, Japan (Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010), but it probably represents an extralimital stray rather than an extension of the species’ range.) The distribution also includes a few estuaries and rivers (e.g., the <em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em> subspecies appears to be found exclusively in the Yangtze River system; Gao 1991, Gao and Zhou 1995).

Partly because of their small size, which limits their strength to break free once entangled, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994), and incidental mortality in fishing gear has been documented throughout the range of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises. Fishing effort with gear documented to catch Finless Porpoises accidentally (including gillnets, trawls, stow nets, and seines) is intense in many areas where the species occurs or occurred. Although not quantified as rigorously as for some <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> populations, regional declines (and possible local extirpations) of <em>N. phocaenoides</em> have been reported, presumably due to a combination of fishing pressure, coastal development and industrialization, pollution, and heavy vessel traffic (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2005, Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/> <br/>The data are insufficient to make a rigorous quantitative assessment of population trend for this species in any part of its range, but the scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 30% over the last three generations (about 45 years, assuming 15 years/generation as estimated for <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> by Moore 2015) (<a name=""_Hlk486670028"">A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4)</a>. The factor most responsible for such a decline would be incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d, “exploitation”), but the loss and degradation of habitat (subcriterion c) and pollution (chemical and acoustic; subcriterion e) are likely contributing factors as well. None of the threats has been seriously addressed in any part of the species’ range, even though threat levels are presumably increasing.<br/> <br/> Therefore, the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise qualifies for Vulnerable under Red List criteria A2cde, <a name=""_Hlk486670084"">A3cde, and A4cde, </a>considering that the causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population size—bycatch, decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollution—have not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.","<p>Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. They occur in waters &lt; 200 m deep and can be sighted up to 240 km from shore in some areas. It is uncertain which of the two currently recognized species of Finless Porpoises (possibly both) occurs farther offshore, especially in areas of sympatry.</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).</p>  <p>Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004). <br/></p>  Higher numbers of Finless Porpoises are present in Hong Kong waters in winter and spring than in other seasons (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Seasonal differences in density and distribution, with higher densities in the winter months of November to January, have been observed along the coast of southern Maharashtra, India, and acoustic monitoring data from there have been interpreted to suggest both seasonal and diurnal patterns of occurrence in near-shore waters (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017). Minton <em>et al</em>. (2013) also observed a seasonal signal in their vessel surveys in Kuching Bay, with higher densities of Finless Porpoises observed in March, April, and May, which coincided with the occurrence of larger groups containing very small calves. Observations of porpoise behaviour in the bay were interpreted as suggesting that it is an important feeding and calving area (Zulkifli Poh 2013). Two stranded individuals had large shrimp in their stomachs (G. Minton, pers. comm., cited in IWC 2017).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002b). Finless Porpoises are caught in nets in Iranian, Indian, Pakistani and Malaysian coastal waters, although there are no good estimates of the magnitude of such catches (e.g., see Collins <em>et al.</em> 2005, Jaaman <em>et al</em>. 2009, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2010). In East Malaysia, Finless Porpoises are caught as bycatch in ‘fish stakes’ in Sabah (Jaaman <em>et al.</em> 2009) and one individual was found entangled in the line of a crab trap in Sarawak (G. Minton pers. comm. 2011), where cetacean bycatch is prevalent (Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016, IWC 2017). Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the Taiwan Strait (where the two species of Finless Porpoises are sympatric), a considerable number of both species are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). In Hong Kong waters, porpoises are caught regularly by trawl nets and gillnets, but there are no estimates of bycatch levels (Parsons and Jefferson 2000, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2002b). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters, the apparently high bycatch of Finless Porpoises (Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999) is a serious concern. In Maharashtra, India, during 2014-2016, at least twenty Finless Porpoise carcasses washed ashore, a few of them known to have drowned in shore seine nets and gillnets (M. Sule, pers. comm<em>.</em>).</p>  <p>As a coastal species, the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise is also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming, causeways, and harbour (and other) development throughout Asia (including the Persian/Arabian Gulf) means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003, Braulik<em> et al. </em>2010). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, Parsons and Chan 1998, Minh <em>et al</em>. 1999, Parsons 1999, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002b, Ramu <em>et al.</em> 2005). The number of reported Finless Porpoise strandings in Hong Kong has increased in recent years, partly due to increasing public awareness and reporting of local cetaceans, but also possibly due to escalating levels of human impacts (T.A. Jefferson pers. comm. 2017). In the Persian/Arabian Gulf, chemicals from recent wars exacerbate total pollution loads in coastal waters from the usual sources such as industry, agriculture and households (Braulik <em>et al. </em>2010). Vessel collisions, especially involving high-speed ferries, may be a particular problem for porpoises in Hong Kong (Parsons and Jefferson 2000).</p>  <p>The following summary of examples illustrates the problems faced by this species:</p>  <p></p><p>In Chinese waters (excluding the considerable fisheries operating in Taiwanese waters), more than 3.5 million gillnets were estimated to be in use in the early 1990s (Zhou and Wang 1994). In India, the use of gillnets reportedly had increased from about 18,000 in 1950 to more than 216,000 by 1980 and gillnets were also being used extensively in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar (Mohan 1994). Since the time of those reports, gillnetting effort certainly would have increased considerably in these and other regions because there are few (if any) restrictions on this kind of fishing gear anywhere in the range of the species. Porpoise habitat in Myanmar is heavily fished with gillnets and other types of gear capable of taking small cetaceans incidentally (Smith and Than Tun 2008). A drift gillnet fishery for elasmobranchs is of concern in the Bangladesh Sundarbans (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008). In East Malaysia, Finless Porpoise numbers are thought to have ‘greatly declined’ due to bycatch in fisheries (Jaaman <em>et al. </em>2009), and commercial fishing (gillnetting, trawling, purse-seining) is intensive off Peninsular Malaysia where bycatch of Finless Porpoises is known to occur even though it is not monitored regularly (L. Ponnampalam pers. comm. August 2017). Surveys in the coastal waters of Vietnam have resulted in very few sightings of cetaceans. In a study by Smith <em>et al.</em> (1997), no sightings were made of Finless Porpoises yet local whale temples contained many skulls of them as well as other cetacean species. A survey around Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam, in 2015 found evidence of Finless Porpoises being bycaught in trawl nets (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm., August 2017). The impacts of war in the 1960s and 1970s, compounded by intense fishing (especially the use of gillnets) in recent years and ongoing, are likely at least partly responsible for the near absence of cetaceans from these waters. In Iran (Persian/Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman/Sea of Oman), bycatch in fisheries appears to be the greatest threat to marine mammals and removals from apparently small, localized populations of Finless Porpoises may be unsustainable (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2010). Two major marine mammal die-offs occurred in the Persian/Arabian Gulf in the 1980s and 1990s, possibly related to major oil spills (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2005). Finless Porpoise sightings in Pakistan’s Indus Delta region were apparently decreasing in the 1970s (Pilleri and Gihr 1972, Pilleri and Pilleri 1979) and by the 1990s the species had nearly disappeared from this badly degraded area (see Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1997). </p>  <p>The Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise is one of several cetacean species that have greatly declined or disappeared from large parts of their range in Thailand, largely as a result of coastal habitat degradation and fishery bycatch (IWC 1994). </p>  No large-scale direct hunting of this species is known to occur. In some parts of their range, people apparently are averse to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data) but in other areas they are consumed. Direct killing or capture of Finless Porpoises appears to be relatively rare (Reeves <em>et al. </em>1997) but development of intentional fisheries for marine mammals from incidental captures (and economic benefits from subsequent consumption and marketing) may have increased in parts of Southeast Asia as preferred marine resources have been over-fished (see Perrin 2002).","<p>Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (Jefferson and Hung 2004, IWC 2006), mostly in regions where the Narrow-ridged species (<em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) dominates, if not exists solely. Numbers of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises in Hong Kong and adjacent waters were estimated to be at least 217 (coefficient of variation (CV) 21-150%) (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002a).</p>  <p>A vessel line-transect estimate of Finless Porpoises in Kuching Bay, Sarawak, Malaysia was 135 individuals (CV 31%, 95% confidence interval 74-246) (Minton <em>et al.</em> 2013). This represents a relatively small part of the species’ overall range (known or predicted) in western Borneo; there are no published abundance estimates for nearby areas (IWC 2017). A preliminary estimate of &gt;1,000 from vessel line-transect surveys is available from the Langkawi Archipelago, Peninsular Malaysia (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm., August 2017).</p>  An estimate for a large area in the coastal waters of Bangladesh was 1,382 (CV 55%) but the density was very low compared to some of the reported densities of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in Japanese waters (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>The type specimen was supposed to have come from the Cape of Good Hope, but this location is believed to be erroneous; it is now generally accepted that the type locality is the Malabar coast of India (Rice 1998, Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In general, Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises occur in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal marine waters (as well as some river mouths and estuaries) around the northern rim of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans from the Persian/Arabian Gulf (Preen 2004, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2005) eastwards around the rim of the Indian Ocean to the Indo-Malay region (Ponnampalam 2012) and to Java, Indonesia (but apparently not the Philippines) and northwards to the Taiwan Strait and central Chinese waters (Gao 1991, Gao and Zhou 1995). This is the more tropical and wide-ranging of the two species of Finless Porpoises. Records of this species from northern Chinese waters (e.g., Wang 1992) probably represent rare or extralimital events. Finless Porpoises are seen regularly (when sea conditions are favourable) in Sarawak, East Malaysia (Minton <em>et al. </em>2011), in at least parts of Peninsular Malaysia (e.g., they are the most frequently seen cetaceans around the Langkawi Archipelago according to Louisa Ponnampalam (pers. comm. 2017, J.Y. Wang unpublished data)), year-round (but with seasonal influxes) in Hong Kong (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2002a), and in parts of the western Taiwan Strait (J.Y. Wang unpub. data). They are also present along the East Kalimantan coastline of Borneo (D. Kreb pers. comm. 2011). In India, they are found in shallow waters along virtually the entire length of both the east and the west coasts, with sightings and strandings more commonly reported on the west coast (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017). One possible explanation for the difference is that the east coast has only pockets of preferred habitat, while more continuous or contiguous porpoise habitat is available along the west coast (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Given the paucity of dedicated cetacean survey effort in much of the species’ suspected range, the map includes the possible or projected range where oceanic features are consistent with the species’ known preferred habitat. As such, the species has not been recorded for all the states within the hypothetical range as shown on the map.

Nevertheless, preliminary analysis on available data suggests that the species is negatively impacted by intensive irrigated agriculture that has fragmented its prime habitat and perhaps also its population in India (see Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;The absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, a future prediction on population decline can be made based on available information on the geographical range of the species, niche model analysis and current change in land use regimes.<br/><br/>Most of the distributional range of the species in India and Nepal lies outside the protected area network and in the deciduous forests of central India which are severely disturbed. The total extent of prime habitat in India and Nepal is around 25% of the total distributional range within these countries.<br/><br/>The current (2015) Government of India has made provisions for speedy approval of developmental projects in non-protected areas including areas under mining, industrialisation and urbanisation (Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Moreover, there are plans for expanding the national area under agriculture by 10% by 2017 (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014), a development which will continue in the future. Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species are rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy since the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. The impact of this development on persistence of biodiversity remains unclear.<br/><br/>Assuming 10 years as the average life span of the Rusty-spotted Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year, we estimate the average age of mature individuals (Generation Length - GL) in the current population at around 4 years, using the formula by Pacifici <em>et al.</em> (2013): GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3, Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR). In the next three Rusty-spotted Cat generations, i.e. 12 years, the prime locations where populations are likely to persist are protected areas as these are the only zones remaining close to intact. This translates to 75% of habitat in the current distributional range facing an imminent danger of being converted. As much of this is marginal habitat for the species, a 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over the next three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population and therefore has a concomitantly greater contribution to the overall ‘average’ global change.<br/><br/>Therefore, a future decline of 20-25% over the next three generations is suspected, occurring primarily due to projected habitat loss in central India, with populations stable only in protected areas and little information available about the small proportion of the population found in Sri Lanka.","Though the species is also found in proximity to human habitation (Worah 1991, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mukherjee 1998, Nekaris 2003), preliminary results of a study using niche models and known Rusty-spotted Cat locations within India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material), suggests that at a broad scale this cat’s distribution is limited by large contiguous tracts of hostile habitat, specifically intensive, irrigated agriculture (Silva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These results were a consensus of four models that incorporated land cover, bioclimatic variables and disturbance measures with 61 location points of the species. The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>There are recent records of the Rusty-spotted Cat from the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka in small, mostly isolated forest patches (&lt;5 km²) interspersed with tea estates but it is not known if the species occurs in or uses the tea plantation areas (Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). <br/><br/>A few observations suggest that the species preys on rodents (Kunal Patel and Vidya Athreya <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em>).","Habitat loss and the spread of cultivation are serious problems for wildlife in South Asia. The total extent of prime habitat of the Rusty-spotted Cat in India and Nepal is equivalent to around 25% of the range of the species in these countries. These are perhaps the only areas where populations of the species are likely to persist in the future. This translates to 75% of the current habitat in India and Nepal facing an imminent danger of conversion to urban areas, industry, mining and other forms of land use hostile to Rusty-spotted Cat (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014, Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species is rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy during the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. Categorization of certain portions of the species’s habitat (scrub, degraded forest) as wasteland facilitates such conversion (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.). <br/><br/>As much of the distributional range constitutes marginal habitat for the species, this 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population<br/><br/>Since much of the species’s range is within hugely human-dominated areas undergoing rapid land use change, fragmentation of habitat and disease should be considered as serious threats. There are concerns regarding possible hybridization of Rusty-spotted Cat with domestic cats (Kittle and Watson 2004) but these have yet to be substantiated and measured to determine if this factor is indeed a threat to the species. There is a belief that Rusty-spotted Cats do not get into conflict, unlike Jungle Cats, since they are believed not to prey on poultry (Manakadan and Sivakumar 2006). However, this needs to be backed by research and the threats need to be evaluated across the species’s global distribution. <br/><br/>Reflecting the uncertainty of this assessment, the species should be prioritised for research and monitoring.","Information on this species is not just meagre but also incidental and hence it is difficult to infer, with confidence, its population size, connectivity between populations, threats, and persistence in the future. It appears to be rare almost wherever it occurs (Kunal Patel and Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). <br/><br/>Population trend: the absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, the niche model from India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material) suggests a fragmented population.&#160;The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country (Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"The Rusty-spotted Cat was earlier believed to be restricted to India and Sri Lanka but recent photographic records show its presence in Bardia National Park, Nepal (Ramjan Choudhary and Rabin Kadariya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), bordering India. Its geographical distribution is as yet not clearly documented but recent locality records suggest it is more widespread than earlier believed (Chakraborty 1978, Phillips 1984, Wright 1984, Miththapala 2006, Athreya 2010, Mukherjee <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Raza Kazmi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Jugal Tiwari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Anonymous 2013, Dharmendra Khandal <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Pankaj Koparde and Gaurang Gowande <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,&#160;Ramjan Choudhary and&#160;Rabin Kadariya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Nevertheless it has a relatively restricted global distribution for a cat and little is known of its ecology or local abundance (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Within India the distribution of this species is similar to, though far more restricted than, the Jungle Cat <em>Felis chaus</em> (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.).",,Terrestrial,"The Indian population is included on CITES Appendix I, while the Sri Lanka and Nepal populations are included on CITES Appendix II.

In Belize, it is threatened by increasing frequency of hurricanes.&#160;Climate change is an increasing threat, as dry seasons are becoming longer, and precipitation and water flow in streams are decreasing (Guatemala and Belize Red List Assessment Workshop August 2019).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><br/>In Honduras, associated pollution from the use of herbicides and pesticides and coffee harvesting processes, and human-induced forest fires are threats to this species (L.

It breeds by direct development and lays its eggs on land.","The main threat is ongoing habitat loss and degradation due to agriculture, livestock, logging, human settlement, and fire, as well as the added risk of resulting water pollution (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019, Robleto-Hernández<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2019); however, these do not explain the extent of the past decline witnessed at higher elevations. Pollution, presumably due to the fumigation of crops, has also been suggested as one cause of the decline at high elevations. Additionally, it is noteworthy to mention that by 1996 that most, if not all, streamside&#160;<em>Craugastor</em>&#160;known to occur above 900 m asl were thought to have disappeared in Honduras (Wilson and McCranie 1998). Reasons for the disappearances of this species remains unclear, although infection with chytridiomycosis together with the alteration of its habitat is a strong possibility (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytrid has been detected within its range in Nicaragua, specifically Parque Nacional Volcán Maderas, Isla de Ometepe (García Roa <em>et al. </em>2014) and Reserva Natural Volcán Mombacho, Granada (Stark <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Articulos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;In Parque Nacional Pico Bonito, the area from which this species was recorded is subject to extensive landslides. Additional major threats include deforestation, as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Parque Nacional Montaña de Santa Bárbara is being deforested for coffee and avocado, fruits, and flowers (L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019). In addition, selective logging for timber and forest fires are affecting its habitat in Parque Nacional Montaña de Santa Bárbara (L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019). In Parque Nacional Pico Pijol, extensive habitat loss for coffee plantations, illegal selective logging for hardwoods, road development, and erosion and pollution caused by coffee farming and logging are all ongoing threats. The cultivation of cardamom, coffee, and flowers is taking place within the boundaries of Parque Nacional Cusuco (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019), and the associated water pollution from herbicides and coffee harvesting processes [aguas mieles] is a concern (L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019). Another major threat is an increase in intentional human-induced fires for clearing of habitat for agriculture (J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019). The building of roads in view of increasing hydroelectric development, increasing human settlements, and selective logging are causing habitat loss within&#160;Parque Nacional Cusuco&#160;(J. Kolby, F. Castañeda, M. Solís and L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019). About 20% of its habitat in Parque Nacional Cerro Azul Meambar (NW part of the park around Los Pinos) is well-protected; however, in the southern portion of this park (Río Bonito and San José de los Planes) clear-cutting of the forest for small-holder crops is taking place (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).&#160;Encroaching subsistence agriculture and livestock grazing activities are threats to the buffer zone of Parque Nacional&#160;Montaña de Yoro (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).<br/><br/>As of 2016, a native boring pine beetle has devastated the pine forests of the region where this species occurs, which encourages widespread harvesting of the dying timber for energy production; increased intentional fires to eliminate the excess biomass; and subsequent conversion of burned areas to cropland. The destruction of the forests by the beetle have ceased as of 2019, however another outbreak will likely occur in the future during the next El Niño cycle (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change is considered to be another ongoing threat, especially for subpopulations found above 1,000 m asl. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<strong><br/></strong>","In 2004, this species was reported to have been formerly common, and seemed to have disappeared above 900 m asl in Honduras, along with several other stream-dwelling <em>Eleutherodactylus</em> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">sensu lato</span> species.

Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).

Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further.

62259374,41587,Vulpes macrotis,Least Concern,,2014,2014-07-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Kit Fox inhabits the deserts and arid lands of western North America. Generally, the species is common to rare, with population densities fluctuating with annual environmental conditions. Estimation of a population size or even population trends for this species is not possible with currently available information. Population monitoring for this species is largely limited to only a few specific sites. However, natural habitats occupied by the Kit Fox are being transformed (e.g., agriculture, solar energy). Thus, in numerous locations throughout the range, it is safe to assume that, overall, populations and area of occupancy are declining. Nonetheless, the species currently does not meet any of the thresholds for the threatened categories, and is presently assessed as Least Concern. However, this status could change over the next several decades if current habitat loss trends continue.","The Kit Fox inhabits arid and semi-arid regions encompassing desert scrub, chaparral, halophytic, and grassland communities (McGrew 1979, O'Farrell 1987). Areas with sparse ground cover are preferred (McGrew 1977, Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is found in elevations ranging from 400–1,900 m a.s.l., although Kit Foxes generally avoid rugged terrain with slopes &gt;5% (Warrick and Cypher 1998). Loose textured soils may be preferred for denning. Kit Foxes will use agricultural lands, particularly orchards, on a limited basis, and also can inhabit urban environments (Morrell 1972, Cypher 2010). Home range size varies from 251 ha to 1160 ha and generally does not differ between sexes (Cypher 2003). Size can vary with habitat conditions, particularly food availability (Spiegel 1996, Zoellick <em>et al</em>. 2002). Kit foxes are primarily nocturnal and nightly movements exceeding 14 km have been reported (Zoellick <em>et al</em>. 1989, 2002). Kit Foxes use dens year-round and uses include daytime resting, escaping predators, avoiding temperature extremes, conserving moisture, and bearing and rearing young (Egoscue 1962, Morrell 1972, Koopman <em>et al</em>. 1998). Kit Foxes can excavate their own dens, but also will modify and use the burrows of badgers, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and kangaroo rats (Morrell 1972, List 1997, Koopman <em>et al</em>. 1998). Dens are distributed throughout home ranges, and an individual fox typically uses over 11 dens during a given year (Koopman <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Kit Foxes primarily consume animal prey and common items include rodents, rabbits, invertebrates, birds, lizards, and snakes. Among rodents, kangaroo rats, pocket mice, prairie dogs, and ground squirrels generally are preferred, and common invertebrate prey include beetles, crickets, and grasshoppers (Cypher 2003, List <em>et al</em>. 2003). Fluctuations in food availability related to variable annual precipitation levels are a primary factor driving Kit Fox population dynamics (White and Garrott 1997, Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000). Kit Foxes do not require free water but will drink it if available (Egoscue 1956, Golightly and Ohmart 1984).<br/><br/>Kit Foxes experience intense interference and exploitative competition from other species, particularly coyotes (White <em>et al</em>. 1995, Cypher and Spencer 1998, Kozlowski<em> et al</em>. 2008). Other competitors include bobcats, badgers, golden eagles, and red foxes. Predators generally are the primary source of mortality, but other causes include vehicles, harvest, and rodenticides (Ralls and White 1995; Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2014). Disease does not appear to be a significant factor in most Kit Fox populations. At one site, annual survival probabilities for adults ranged from 0.20 to 0.81 over 16 years with a mean of 0.44 (Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000).&#160;<br/><br/>Kit Foxes pair during October and November (if not already paired), and breed in December and January (Egoscue 1956). Gestation is 49-55 days, and parturition occurs during January-March (Egoscue 1956, Egoscue 1962, Zoellick <em>et al</em>. 1987). Typical litter size averages about 4 and ranges from 1-9 (Cypher 2003). Annual reproductive success is strongly influenced by food availability (Egoscue 1975, White and Garrott 1997) and at one location ranged from 20-100% over a 16-year period (Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000). Kit Foxes mate for life and are primarily monogamous with occasional instances of polygyny (Egoscue 1962; Ralls <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2007). Young from previous years, typically females, may delay dispersal and assist with raising the current year’s litter (Koopman <em>et al</em>. 2000, Ralls <em>et al</em>. 2001).","The main threat to the long-term survival of the Kit Fox is habitat conversion, mainly to agriculture but also to urban and industrial development. In both western and eastern Mexico, prairie dog towns, which support important populations of Kit Foxes are being converted to agricultural fields (e.g., Ávila-Flores <em>et al.</em> 2012), and in eastern Mexico the road network is expanding, producing a concomitant increase in the risk of vehicle mortality. In the San Joaquin Valley of California, habitat conversion for agriculture is slowing, but habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation associated with industrial and urban development are still occurring at a rapid pace.&#160;More recently, expansive industrial-scale solar energy generating facilities are being constructed throughout the western USA, but particularly in California, Arizona, and Nevada.","The species is common to rare. Density fluctuates with annual environmental conditions, which are dependent upon precipitation (Cypher <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Utah, density ranged from 0.1–0.8/km² (Egoscue 1956, 1975). In California, density varied from 0.15–0.24/km² over a period of three years on one study site (White <em>et al.</em> 1996) and from 0.2–1.7/km² over 15 years on another study site (Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2000). Kit Fox densities in prairie dog town complexes in Mexico were 0.32–0.8/km² in Chihuahua (List 1997) and 0.1/km² in Coahuila and Nuevo Leon (Côtera 1996).<br/><br/>In Mexico, data on which to base a population estimate for Kit Foxes are only available from two localities with very specific characteristics (presence of prairie dog towns). Therefore, the estimation of a population size for the country or even population trends is not possible with current information. However, because natural habitats occupied by the Kit Fox are being transformed, it is safe to assume that, overall, populations of the Kit Fox in Mexico are declining. In the past 10 years, about 40% of prairie dog towns in Coahuila and Nuevo Leon were converted to agriculture (L. Scott and E. Estrada unpubl.), and of the area occupied in Chihuahua by prairie dogs in 1988, 76% remained in 2005 (Ávila <em>et al</em>. 2012) and by 2013 only 3% remained &#160;(R. Sierra and E. Ponce pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In the United States, Kit Fox abundance is unknown. Populations are relatively large and trends are assumed to be relatively stable in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and possibly the Mjoave Desert of California, based on extensive remaining suitable habitat. Populations in Colorado, Idaho, and Oregon are relatively small and trends are unknown (Cypher 2003). Populations of the Endangered (USFWS) San Joaquin Kit Fox in the San Joaquin Valley of California are likely still declining due to continuing habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation (USFWS 1998).",Decreasing,"The Kit Fox inhabits the deserts and arid lands of western North America. In the United States, it occurs from southern California to western Colorado and western Texas, north into southern Oregon and Idaho. In Mexico, it occurs across the Baja California Peninsula and across northern Sonora and Chihuahua to western Nuevo León, and south into northern Zacatecas (McGrew 1979, Hall 1981).","In Mexico, Kit Foxes are occasionally sold illegally on the pet market.

The Kit Fox is considered Vulnerable in Mexico (SEMARNAT 2010). In the United States, the San Joaquin Kit Fox (<em>V. m. mutica</em>) is federally classified as Endangered, and as Threatened by the state of California (USFWS 1998). In Oregon, Kit Foxes are classified as Threatened. In Colorado, Kit Foxes are classified as Endangered. In Idaho, Kit Foxes are considered a protected non-game species.&#160;Harvests are not permitted in Idaho, Oregon, or California, and the Kit Fox is a protected furbearer species (i.e., regulated harvests) in Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. In Mexico, the vulnerable status of the Kit Fox grants conservation measures for the species, but these are not enforced. In the United States, state and federal protections for Kit Foxes are being enforced.&#160;<br/>In Mexico, Kit Foxes are found in the Biosphere Reserves of El Vizcaino, Mapimi, El Pinacate and Janos, in the Area of Special Protection of Cuatro Ciénegas, and are probably found in another eight protected areas throughout their range. In the United States, they occur in numerous protected areas throughout their range.

General biological information is needed from more localities in the Mexican range of the Kit Fox.

The species is likely to be endemic to the region where it has been recorded, but it is feared that some subpopulations may have already been lost due to ongoing habitat loss outside the protected areas.

Water temperature in the streams range between 16.9–18.6 degrees C (17.8 ± 0.5 degrees C) and the depth of water varies from 40–80 cm. Individuals have been commonly observed on the moss-covered boulders by, next to, and in streams. Most boulders have accumulated leaf litter on the surface, under which individuals and amplectant pairs have been found (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). All juveniles were observed near stream banks covered with leaf litter and gravel. All other individuals were found on the land within ~1-2 m of water. Of the males observed, 89% were found on boulders (2–4 m circumference, 30–50 cm above the water level) in mid-stream (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). When disturbed, individuals of this species dive into the streams and retreat into submerged rocky crevices, remaining underwater up to 15–25 minutes without emerging. Ten pairs in amplexus have also been found underwater, but no details of egg laying and development have been noted (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It is expected to breed in streams by larval development,&#160;as with its congeners.&#160;This species is not likely to tolerate habitat disturbance (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).","Within the Peak Wilderness Nature Reserve, Sripada Peak is a place of worship of all religions in the country of Sri Lanka, with millions of visitors, especially during the six-month-long peak tourism season. During this time, a large amount of garbage collects, light pollution increases, and the forest is exploited (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2013). A stream at one of the popular tourist sites, 'Seethagagula', has been blocked in one place by a private company, and the water has been diverted to an artificial tank to facilitate a place for visitors to bathe (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020).&#160;Downstream from this site large amounts of domestic chemicals (e.g., shampoo) are being disposed of in the stream, and it is suspected that this could negatively impact amphibian populations given that large aggregations of tadpoles (not of this species) were observed at higher elevations of the same stream, but in areas below the polluted site low densities or no individuals were observed (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020). Furthermore, during the dry season the reduced volume of water in the stream may lead to greater concentrations of chemicals in the breeding pools (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020).<br/><br/>Tea cultivation in the surrounding areas is slowly expanding, and illegal tree felling to cultivate tea has become a major threat in the area.&#160;Additionally, during the wet season fish species such as the Stone Sucker&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Garra ceylonensis</span>) travel upstream and block the stream in several places, which could create a barrier for the breeding of this species as it is suspected to breed in streams (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020). Invasive plant species are also suspected of causing changes to the understory and canopy cover of the area (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020). Road construction and the planting of non-native tree species may lead to soil erosion and landslides, making existing habitat unsuitable for this species (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Within&#160;Piduruthalagala Forest Reserve, the construction of mini hydropower stations pose&#160;a threat to the species (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change also presents a threat to this species, as annual rainfall is declining steeply across this region, especially on the perhumid western slopes. This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016).&#160; This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008).&#160; These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests).&#160;<span><br/><span><br/><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a6ef881a-7fff-ab3c-8644-7da02d2b74d6"">Forest dieback could be an additional threat to this species. It was first observed in Sri Lanka’s montane ‘cloud’ forests by Perera (1978). Prior to 2013, dieback was never documented within Peak Wilderness, and now a large area has been affected (Wickramasinghe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).Despite several studies (see Ranasinghe and Dissanayake 2003, Ranasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2007, Chandrajith<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2009), the aetiology of&#160; dieback remains enigmatic, though there has been concern that an environmental stressor that kills extensive stands of woody vegetation, apart from the loss of suitable habitats for amphibians, may also directly threaten amphibians. Gunawardena<em> </em><em>et al</em>. (1998) and Jayalal<em> et al.</em> (2017) suggest that high acidity in mist- and rain-water may present a significant risk to the highland biota in Sri Lanka. While there is no direct evidence to date (see Silva <em>et al.</em> 2019) that amphibians are negatively affected; it is thought to be a threat for species that inhabit areas where mist persists for long periods, and for species found in open habitats with aquatic life history stages in shallow lentic habitats (M. Meegaskumbura pers. comm. February 2020).<u><strong><br/></strong></u></span>","This species was previously known from only two specimens (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012). There had been no sightings since the original description and the species was believed to be extinct (Manamendra-Arachchi and Pethiyagoda 1998), given that surveys in the the general area of Kandy turned up no new records. It was rediscovered in 2009, when close to 100 individuals were recorded over the course of a two-year study to document amphibian species richness across an elevational gradient (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012). Another subpopulation of 57 individuals was discovered 42 km away during further surveys from 2011-2014 (Gabadage <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). This species is thought to be common in suitable habitats during the wet season, however the pristine stream habitats in which it occurs are difficult to find (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020). A decreasing population trend is inferred from the ongoing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Sri Lanka and for a long time was known only from the general type locality of ""Ceylon"" (= Sri Lanka). The scientific name appeared to suggest that it might have been collected in the vicinity of the city of Kandy in central Sri Lanka; however, all of the Central Province was referred to as Kandy in the late 19th century, when the species was described (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>In 2009 the species was rediscovered in the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary in Central Province, Sri Lanka, at 1,879 m asl (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2012).

Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small geographically isolated subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt; 1000 mature individuals. Anthropogenic mortality of only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals per year from a population of 100 individuals would result in 30%, 50% and 80% declines in population abundance after 3 generations, respectively (see Moore 2015 Table 5).</p>  <p>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the species’ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the species’ range in Australia (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012; Bejder<em> et al.</em> 2012; Cagnazzi<em> et al.</em> 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown<em> et al.</em> 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell<em> et al.</em> 2013). Additionally, the species’ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  Considering the available evidence and following a precautionary approach we considered this species as Vulnerable under IUCN criterion C2a(i) because the total number of mature individuals is plausibly fewer than 10,000, a projected continuing decline due to cumulative impacts; and each of the defined subpopulations studied to date is estimated to contain fewer than 1,000 mature individuals. Although the species may not meet any of the criteria for Endangered at this time, it is likely to do so in the near future considering It is possible that 1) number of mature individuals is less than 2,500, 2) the reductions in population size have been larger and pervasive enough to cause a net reduction for the entire species of at least 20% over a period of 2 generations and 3) that the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation across their range is ≤ 250 individuals.","<p>Within their geographical range Australian Humpback Dolphins are found primarily in coastal waters. Opportunistic data collected during aerial surveys designed to estimate the distribution and abundance of Dugongs (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) in the Great Barrier Reef indicated that Australian Humpback Dolphins were sighted on average 6.4 km (se = 1.26, Range 0-55.6 km) from the nearest point of land and 2.7 km (std. err. = 0.27, range = 0-8.1 km) to the nearest shallow area (either point of land or charted reef, less than 2m deep at low tide) (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997). In Queensland and in the Northern Territory humpback dolphins are found mostly within 10 km off the coast (Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). Accordingly, in Keppel Bay, Central Queensland, where up to 10 km offshore waters still remain below 10m in depth, Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were recorded on average 2.8 km (SD = 4.21, Range = 0-24 km) off the coast. In Western Australia, sightings obtained from recent exploratory surveys and ongoing studies seem to confirm a similar pattern, with the majority of the sightings obtained within 5 km off the coast (Brown and Hunt personal communication). In Papua New Guinea, the first tentative sightings of Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were made in the Kikori Delta region; close to the coastline and in waters 1.6-11.4 m deep (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>While coastal waters are arguably the primary habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins, most survey work has been conducted close to the coast, thus the extent to which humpback dolphins use offshore waters is not yet fully understood. Observations of Australian Humpback Dolphins at least up to 55.6 km from land, indicate that this species may occasionally venture further offshore especially in sheltered and protected waters such as in the Great Barrier Reef where sand flats occur almost continuously from the mainland to the outer reefs (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997).</p>  <p>Along the Australian Coast Humpback Dolphins are more likely to be found in relatively shallow and protected coastal habitats such as inlets, estuaries, shallow bays, inshore reefs and coastal archipelagos rather than in open stretches of coastline. In Queensland and Northern Territory, humpback dolphins are mainly found in water less than 20 km from the nearest river mouth and in water less than 15-20 m deep (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). Few animals have been observed in waters up to 30-50 m deep, but remained in close proximity (within 5 km) to the coast (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). In both Queensland and Northern Territory humpback dolphins have been also recorded as far as 20-50 km upstream in large rivers such as the East Alligator River, Northern Territory, and in the Fitzroy and Brisbane rivers in Queensland (Cagnazzi 2010, Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). No studies on habitat use have been conducted in Western Australia. Preliminary surveys and ongoing studies in few locations indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins appear to utilize a wide range of near-shore habitats. For example, around the North West Cape, dolphins have been sighted in clear waters over Ningaloo Reef, and in turbid waters in Exmouth Gulf, and in depths ranging from 1 to 40 m deep (T. Hunt 2015, pers. comm., 19 February) </p>  <p>Among subpopulations there appear to be some differences in habitat selection suggesting high adaptability of this species to local environment characteristics. For example, in Cleveland Bay Australian Humpback Dolphins showed preferences for waters close to the coast and 2-5 m deep, followed by waters 1-2 m deep whereas in Keppel Bay (~630 Km south) humpback dolphins showed preference for waters 2-5 and 5-10 m deep, while In Port Curtis (~700 km further south) humpback dolphins showed preference for water 5-10 and 10-15 m deep. Within these regions humpback dolphins showed selection for various types of habitats including dredged channels, reefs, seagrass flats and mangroves.</p>  Across Australia, humpback dolphins have been observed feeding in a wide range of inshore-estuarine coastal habitats including rivers and creeks, expose banks, shallow flats, rock and coral reefs as well as over submerged reefs in waters at least up to 40 m deep (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012, Cagnazzi 2010, Parra 2006, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). The analysis of stomach contents of 6 humpback dolphins stranded in Queensland indicated they are opportunistic-generalist feeders, preying on a wide variety of fishes including both bottom-dwelling species (e.g., grunts, tooth ponyfishes, croakers, flatheads, and whitings) as<strong> </strong>well as pelagic species (e.g., cardinal fishes, gizzard shads, anchovies, false trevally and barracudas) (Parra and Jedensjö 2014). Among these, Grunt fish (<em>Pomadasys</em> sp.) were the most numerically important prey accounting for more than half (52.9%) of all prey items, followed by the cardinal fish (<em>Apogon </em>sp., 10.4%) and smelt-whiting (<em>Sillago </em>sp., 9.7%) (Parra and Jedensjö 2014)","<strong>Habitat Loss and Degradation<br/></strong>Several regions across Humpback Dolphins’ range in Australia have been substantially modified both inland, to allow mining, agricultural and grazing activities and along the coast to allow industrial ports; marinas, aquaculture and residential developments. Concurrently, several mining industries are undergoing major upgrades and extensions, while new extraction sites have been proposed to meet an increasing export demand of primary resources (carbon, oil, natural gas, woods, aluminium and uranium), particularly in northwestern Australia and along the central coast of Queensland (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Queensland Government 2012). As a result significant expansions of existing ports facilities are underway across the coastal range of Australian Humpback Dolphins (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) For example, by 2020 the port capacity along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Queensland, is expected to triple to support the predicted growth in Queensland’s annual coal production (Grech <em>et al</em>. 2013). The IUCN considered this unprecedented scale of development as a serious threat to biodiversity in the GBRWHA (Douvere and Badman 2012).<br/><br/>Activities associated with coastal zone developments such as land reclamation, dredging, seismic surveys, drilling, blasting, shipping and resource extraction may result in habitat loss and degradation for Australian Humpback Dolphins. For example, it has been estimated that in the Fitzroy River, Queensland, between 14 to 25% of Australian Snubfin Dolphin (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) habitat (which largely overlaps with that of Australian Humpback Dolphins) will be directly modified if a planned industrial port development were to occur (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Besides their influence on dolphins’ habitat, these activities have the potential to cause disturbance of humpback dolphins’ normal activities through physical displacement and increasing underwater noise pollution (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dredging involved in the construction, maintenance and expansion of ports is of particular concern as it may potentially displace dolphins from important habitats as a result of changes in fish distribution, increased vessel activities, declining water quality and underwater noise (Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Todd <em>et al</em>. 2015). Because most ports across the Australian Humpback Dolphins range are located in relatively shallow waters, they all require large volumes of dredging. For example, the Gladstone Western Basin project in Queensland involved the dredging of 22 million cubic meters of soil (Ports Australia 2014).<br/><br/>Additionally habitat loss and fragmentation from coastal zone developments and associated activities can influence the population genetic structure of biological populations through their isolation (Keyghobadi 2007). Given the small densities, strong population genetic structure and limited gene flow found among subpopulations of Australian Humpback Dolphins; loss of genetic variation may reduce the ability of individuals to adapt to a changing environment, cause inbreeding depression, reduce survival and reproduction and increase their probability of extinction (Andrews 2014, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><strong><br/>By-catch</strong><br/>Human-related mortality of humpback dolphins in Australian waters is thought to be largely attributable to by-catch in shark nets set for swimmers protection by the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) and in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries for Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em> Bloch 1970) and Threadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em> Macleay 1884) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> Shaw 1804) (Hale 1997, Paterson 1990). There are no estimates of the magnitude of these indirect takes or of their trend over the time.<br/><br/>Fisheries observers on gillnet vessels operating in northern Australian waters between 1981-1985 reported one Australian Humpback Dolphin among the cetacean species incidentally taken (Harwood and Hembree 1987). At least 18 Humpback Dolphins were collected from shark nets along the Queensland coast between 1968-2001 (Haines and Limpus 2002, Heinsohn 1979). Between 1997-2007 a further 13 humpback dolphins were reported caught in the QSCP shark nets and drumlines (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Shark nets have now been removed from most of the Queensland coast and captures of dolphins appear to be small at a state level (Gribble <em>et al</em>. 1998). For example, between 2008 and 2011 no humpback dolphin was reported caught in the shark nets, despite QSCP accounting for 73% of all cetaceans mortalities (Meager <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, given the low population sizes at which this species occurs, the death of even a few individuals per year at a local level could have detrimental consequences on the viability of local subpopulations.<br/><br/><strong>Water pollution</strong><br/>Sources of anthropogenic contaminants are likely to increase in the future across northern Australia, as a result of a widespread contamination by several new pesticides (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012), increasing annual runoff (Chiew and McMahon 2002), and rapid urban and industrial development. As coastal top predators, humpback dolphins may accumulate high concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants through bioaccumulation (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>The water discharge by many rivers across the Humpback Dolphin’s range in Australia is of poor quality, often with contaminant concentrations likely to cause environmental harm (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2012, Francey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Schaffelke <em>et al</em>. 2012). For example an assessment of the relative risk of pollutants from agricultural and land uses ranked most of the rivers in Queensland as relatively high priority (Waterhouse <em>et al</em>. 2012). Agricultural and industrial-sourced pollutants have been identified as the major threats to the coastal water quality especially along the Great Barrier Reef. As a result various contaminants, were detected in sediments samples as well as in several marine species known to be part of the humpback dolphin diet (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Accordingly, a recent study detected high levels of organochlorine compounds (DDTs, PCBs, HCB) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in biopsy samples collected from humpback dolphins along the Queensland coast (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Although exposure to contaminants may not directly cause the death of an animal, it may affect the dolphins’ health in numerous ways, including an increased susceptibility to diseases and impairment of metabolic functions (Bossart 2011, De Swart <em>et al</em>. 1996). The immunosuppressive effect of contaminants may play an important role in the death of humpback dolphins following large floods and major industrial coastal developments (DEHP 2012, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Underwater Noise</strong><br/>Sounds introduced into the marine environment by anthropogenic activities (e.g., dredging, pile-driving, underwater surveying, shipping) may have detrimental effects on marine mammals by interfering with their ability to communicate, echolocate, and/or mask other important natural sounds (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 1995, Nowacek <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>For example, impulsive hammering sounds can be loud, and levels as high as 165 dB re 1 mPa were measured 1 km from a hammer used for pipe installation (Bailey <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent study conducted in the Pearl River Estuary of China, near Hong Kong, to monitor the effects of the world's largest vibration hammer (OCTA-KONG) on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins has suggested that the vibration zone detectable by individual animal extends beyond 3.5 km. While Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins clicks do not appear to be adversely affected, the whistles were susceptible to auditory masking and a safety zone of 500 m radius was proposed (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Floods</strong><br/>Peak mortality of inshore dolphins In Queensland, including Australian Humpback Dolphins, followed sustained periods of elevated freshwater discharge (9 months) (Meager and Limpus 2014). In Queensland floods exceed their natural ranges of variation due to inland catchment modifications that result in a large amount of sediments, heavy metals, nutrients and pesticides being discharged into the estuaries and adjacent coastal areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Furnas 2003). Increases in freshwater discharge may also increase exposure to infectious pathogens such as toxoplasmosis; which has been observed and thought to be the cause of death of four Australian Humpback Dolphins (Bowater <em>et al</em>. 2003). Modelling studies estimated that in some areas the annual runoff in catchments across Australia could increase to up to 15% by the year 2030, due to the increased in rainfall associated with global warming (Chiew and McMahon 2002). Thus, the resilience and recovery capacity of the entire coastal ecosystem including humpback dolphins’ preferred habitat may be put under great threat.<br/><br/><strong>Cumulative threats</strong><br/>The cumulative impact of environmental factors and anthropogenic activities is arguably the primary threat to humpback dolphins (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011). The continuous alteration of coastal systems have greatly undermined the resilience of many wildlife communities, populations, and species living in estuaries, making them more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity events and anthropogenic stressors (Hobday and Lough 2011). The loss of habitat quantity and quality has been identified among the primary drivers of population declines of marine animals. The reduction of suitable habitat may force local populations of humpback dolphins to adjust to the remaining resources through a reduction in survival rate and population size, or emigration to more suitable areas (Andren 1994, Fahrig 1997, Jefferson 2000). Such effects are likely to be exacerbated when natural systems are simultaneously subjected to multiple stressors as a result of cumulative impacts and negative synergistic interactions (Crain <em>et al</em>. 2008, Halpern <em>et al</em>. 2008, Venter <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Recent studies on other inshore dolphin populations living in highly industrialized regions have reported negative population trends. In the Pearl River estuary, China, modelling of demographic data from strandings of humpback dolphins predicted that the population was declining at about 2.4% per annum (Huang et al. 2012), in the Yangtze River the population of Yangtze Finless Porpoise is declining at a rate of about 6% p.a. (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012), while in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, the local isolated bottlenose dolphin population has declined at a rate of about 30% over the last 12 years (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2007). According to this evidence a reduction in the number of Australian Humpback Dolphins could be expected if the impacts of multiple port expansion, development projects, water pollution, vessel traffic and increasing frequency of natural catastrophic events are not properly addressed.","At present, there is no range-wide estimate of the abundance of Australian Humpback Dolphins. Estimates of abundance are available from several discrete locations across Australia (Supplementary Material: Table 1, see Fig. 1 for locations). Additionally, monitoring to estimate abundance is currently underway at several new locations in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Overall, available abundance estimates indicate that humpback dolphins occur in small subpopulations averaging 54-89 individuals and 0.1-0.19 individuals per km² (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the global number of “mature individuals” (i.e. individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction) of Australian Humpback Dolphins is challenging, because relevant demographic data are insufficient or non-existent. If we assume that the proportion of mature individuals (Nm) is similar to that estimated for the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>), which is 50% (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007), each subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) numbers &lt;105 mature individuals. Considering that all available abundance estimates for Australian Humpback Dolphins are low (typically less than 150 individuals; Table 1 in the Supplementary Material), the total number of mature individuals across their range is unlikely to exceed 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>Estimates of population size trends across the species’ range are unknown. Surveys in Cleveland Bay, northeast Queensland, (1999-2002) showed low population sizes (34-54 individuals) and no clear trends, but indicated that even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates population trends will be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size were greater than 20% p.a. (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a). A longer multiyear study (2006-2011) in the Capricorn and Curtis Coast regions, Central Queensland, showed that abundance estimates declined throughout the study in Keppel Bay and Curtis coast region from 115 and 84 individuals in 2007 to 104 and 45 in 2011, respectively (Cagnazzi 2013). The decline in abundance estimates was associated with a large flood event in 2010 and the concurrent expansion of the Port Curtis port facilities (Cagnazzi 2013). Analyses of data collected until 2014 will clarify whether the observed decline is permanent or just a temporary shift in dolphin distribution.<br/><br/>Ongoing monitoring studies (2011-2014) in Bynoe Harbor, Darwin Harbor and Shoal Bay in the Northern Territory, have shown that the numbers of humpback dolphins in these areas are quite small (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) but have remained fairly stable throughout the years (Brooks and Pollock 2014). Estimates in Port Essington Harbor, Northern Territory, varied widely (48-207) among sampling periods (2008-2010). This variation was likely due to movements in and out of the study area, temporary emigration, temporal changes in behaviour, or temporal changes in detectability (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a).<br/><br/>Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small and localized subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt;1,000 mature individuals and that there could well be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. As with other cetaceans, the low reproductive rates of Australian Humpback Dolphins make them vulnerable to even low rates of anthropogenic mortality. For example, assuming a 3% recruitment rate (as estimated for <em>S. chinensis</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em> in Moore 2015) a discrete subpopulation of 100 individuals would decline by 30%, 50% and 80% over 75 years (three generations) if only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals were removed, respectively, per year due to anthropogenic mortality (see Table 5 in Moore 2015).<br/><br/>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the species’ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the species’ range in Australia (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell <em>et al</em>. 2013). Additionally, the species’ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Population Structure</strong><br/>Overall, the genetic data available suggest that Australian Humpback Dolphins exist as a metapopulation of small and relatively isolated subpopulations with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014, Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data). Analysis of population structure using both microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequence data from humpback dolphins from the Dampier Archipelago, and the North West Cape in north Western Australia (~300 km apart) showed significant levels of population structure with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014). Similarly, analysis of population structure among eight sampling locations (from tens to 1,500 kilo meters apart) along the east coast of Queensland indicated significant population differentiation and low levels of migration rates between most sampling locations (Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data).<br/><br/>The available evidence on abundance estimates (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) and population genetic structure indicates Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small, localized populations with limited gene flow. Abundance estimates suggest that there are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. Additionally, no subpopulation studied to date is larger than 200 mature individuals (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Substantial numbers of humpback dolphins have been killed in localized areas along the east coast of Queensland in anti-shark nets set to protect bathers (Heinsohn 1979, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004) . Humpback dolphins are also known to die in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries primarily for |Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) and T|hreadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em>) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> (Anderson 1995, Hale 1997). Given the continuing vulnerability to bycatch in shark nets and gillnets, low densities in surveyed areas, and increased habitat degradation throughout their range (see threats section) it is likely that a continuing decline of at least 10% will occur over a period of 3 generations (about 75 years, assuming generation length is similar to that estimated for <em>S. chinensis </em>in Moore 2015).",Decreasing,"Australian Humpback Dolphins are found in tropical/subtropical waters of the Sahul Shelf from northern Australia to the southern waters of the island of New Guinea(Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). In Australia humpback dolphins are thought to be widely distributed along the northern Australian coastline from approximately the Queensland-New South Wales border (31°27´S, 152°55´E) to western Shark Bay, Western Australia (25°51´S, E113°20´E). However, no dedicated wide-scale surveys throughout this range have been conducted and at present, this continuous distribution is inferred primarily from localized studies; strandings, museum records and aerial surveys for other species (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004). Similarly, the extent of their distribution in the southern waters off the island of New Guinea is also still unclear due to the limited amount of marine mammal survey work carried out in this region. Recent surveys in the Kikori Delta region of Papua New Guinea reported a total of 7 groups of humpback dolphins (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014). Photographic records of these animals indicate that they are likely <em>S. sahulensis</em> but genetic studies are needed to solidly clarify which Sousa species occurs off the island of New Guinea. It is also uncertain if the species occurs in the deep waters (~30-90 m depth) over the continental shelf between Australia and Indonesian New Guinea (the Arafura Sea).<br/><br/>Most studies to date indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins occur mostly close to the coast (within 20 km from land) and in relatively sheltered offshore waters near reefs or islands (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Corkeron <em>et al</em>. 1997, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006b). Furthermore, stomach content analyses indicate Australian Humpback Dolphins feed mainly on fishes associated with coastal-estuarine waters (Parra and Jedensjö 2014). As most survey work has been conducted in coastal waters, this apparent coastal distribution and preference for inshore habitats might be biased.<br/><br/>For purposes of this assessment and in line with discussions on the distribution range for <em>S. sahulensis</em> at the IUCN Workshop to Assess/Re-Assess IUCN Red Listings for Indo-Pacific Genera of Coastal Small Cetaceans (San Diego, 20-21 May 2015), we assume Australian Humpback Dolphins occur 1) continuously across northern Australia and southern New Guinea and 2) up to the 30 m isobath (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Material). Given these assumptions we estimate their geographic range to be approximately 562,193 km² comprised of: ~405,091 km² for Australia (QLD: ~202,344 km², NT: ~98,769 and WA: ~ 103,978 km²) and ~157,102 km² for southern New Guinea. The lack of spatial information on the occurrence of Australian Humpback Dolphins throughout their inferred range precludes an accurate estimation of their extent of occurrence (EOO; i.e. area contained within the shortest continuous imaginary boundary which can be drawn to encompass all the known, inferred or projected sites of present occurrence of a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy) and area of occupancy (AOO; i.e. area within its 'extent of occurrence' which is occupied by a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy). Although both EOO and AOO are likely to be significantly less than the geographic range estimated here, the large extent of their potential distribution suggests that their EOO and AOO are very likely to be above 20,000 km².","<p>There is no robust evidence of traditional use for consumption or medicinal use across the Australian humpback dolphin’s geographical range. In the 1960-70s live-captures (at least 8 individuals) took place in Queensland, Australia, for oceanarium displays (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). A female humpback dolphin wild caught in 1968 and currently held at Sea World (Amity) is estimated to be over 48 years of age. Capture for the purposes of public display is no longer permitted under Australian law.</p>",Marine,"<p>As a recently described new species, Australian Humpback Dolphins have not been listed under any national and International listing. Previous conservation assessments as <em>S. chinensis </em>are summarized<em> </em>in Table 2. The most recent assessment of the conservation status of humpback dolphins (as <em>S. chinensis</em> ) in Australia, concluded the species should be listed as Data Deficient (Woinarski<em> et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>In 2012 The Australian Federal Government commissioned a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and conservation status of Australian tropical inshore dolphins (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2012) and a Draft Coordinated Research Strategy to address knowledge gaps and assess their national conservation status (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2012). These reports led to a technical workshop attended by researchers, statisticians and government and indigenous representatives to review the proposed research objectives identified in the draft research strategy, and agree on research priorities that would allow the assessment of the conservation status of Australian inshore dolphins at a national level. The resulting research strategy (DSEWPaC 2013) identified three specific research objectives applicable to Australian snubfin and humpback dolphins: (1) to conduct a broad-scale assessment of their extent of occurrence and area of occupancy (2) to conduct dedicated multi-year studies of their distribution, abundance and habitat use at selected sites across northern Australia with differing levels of threatening processes; and (3) to undertake a spatial and temporal risk assessment of current and projected threatening processes. Sampling and statistical methods to achieve these objectives have been recently described in Brooks<em> et al.</em> (2014). Following these advances, the Australian Federal Government released in 2014 the Whale and Dolphin Protection Plan, which includes a National Dolphin Conservation Plan. This plan aims to guide research and conservation assessment of Australian Humpback Dolphins and snubfin dolphins by supporting research into their ecology and major threats over the next three years.</p>  <p>Multiple-use marine protected areas in Western Australia (e.g. Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef Marine Park), the Northern Territory (e.g. Garig Gunak Barlu), and Queensland (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Dugong Protected Areas; Moreton Bay Marine Park) cover a substantial portion of the known and presumed habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins in Australian waters and may provide some protection for humpback dolphins. To improve the quality of water discharged into the Great Barrier Reef, in 2008, the Australian Government invested $200 million in The Reef Rescue initiative to help farmers in the Great Barrier Reef catchments to improve farming practices to reduce sediment and nutrient run-off.</p>  <p>In Australia, humpback dolphins have also been identified as a conservation value in Commonwealth waters around Australia in the North, North-west and Temperate East Marine bioregional plans (DSEWPaC 2012a, b, c). These plans were developed under section 176 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and are aimed at improving management and decision making in relation to Australian marine biodiversity and resources. Biologically Important Areas (i.e. areas where species of conservation value displays important behaviors such as breeding, foraging, resting and migration) for the conservation of humpback dolphins were identified using available information at the time and expert scientific knowledge about species’ distribution, abundance and behavior in these regions.</p>  National Guidelines for Whale and Dolphin Watching and for interaction with seismic explorations provide some protection for inshore dolphins (DOE 2005, 2008). Strategies to reduce the entanglement and death of Australian Humpback Dolphins in nets set by The Queensland Shark Control Program for protection of bathers include the use of acoustic alarms, mixed use of nets and drumlines, overall reduction in the number of nets, and establishment of mammal rescue squads (DPI 2001, Gribble<em> et al.</em> 1998).",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The largest subpopulation is exposed to habitat degradation as a result of the actions of feral grazers, however, this is not a pressure which is likely to result in the extinction of this subpopulation and there are no ongoing threats to the other localities. As such the species is close to but does not qualify for listing in a threatened category applying criterion B1. Approval has recently been granted for a wind farm at the Silverton site, and represents a plausible future threat to the species as this is likely to impact the largest subpopulation. This threat is not, however, likely to result in the species being driven to Critically Endangered or Extinct and at present the precise impacts of the wind farm on the Silverton subpopulation are unclear. The species is consequently also close to but does not qualify for listing as Vulnerable applying criterion D2. Reassessment of this species is recommended once wind farm development is underway and any impacts on this species are better-understood, as the species may then warrant listing in a more threatened category.","This<em> </em>is a rock dwelling species which seeks shelter in narrow crevices and perches on prominent rocks (Cogger 2000, Macdonald 2016, Wilson and Swan 2013). The area where the species has been recorded is characterized by higher elevations (between 200-450 m asl) than the surrounding flat, treeless stony desert. Sass and Swan (2010) found the species to be associated with the main ridge system in their study area, with the majority associated with aggregations of rocks along the flatter ridge tops. Similarly, all 15 animals found in a recent targeted survey of Koonenberry Mountain were found at the crest of the range, with none downslope or at the base (G. Swan and M. Irvin unpubl. data). There is some evidence that the presence of this species is negatively associated with the occurrence of the skink <em>Egernia stokesii</em> (Sass and Swan 2010, 2014), which may naturally restrict it to habitat patches where this lizard does not occur. Other&#160;<em>Ctenophorus&#160;</em>species<em>&#160;</em>display temperature dependant sex determination (Harlow 2000). This species exhibits a rapid life history, with animals believed to have a maximum lifespan of 2-3 years (G. Swan unpubl. data).","The rocky terrain where the species occurs is grazed by feral goats. Grazing pressure can be extreme particularly during droughts, and disturbs both the vegetation and rock habitat (Office of Environment and Heritage 2016). Occupancy modelling has found that this species is negatively associated with the presence of goat scat (Sass and Swan 2014). While scat was used in this study as a surrogate measure of grazing activity, Sass and Swan (2014) suggested that contamination of crevices used as refuge sites may directly reduce habitat quality for this lizard. In 2016 the New South Wales Government approved the construction of a long-planned wind farm at the Silverton site, where the largest subpopulation has been recorded. Any disturbance to or destruction of rock outcrops during construction of wind farm infrastructure has the potential to negatively impact this species, and may affect the viability of this subpopulation (NGHEnvironmental 2008).","This species occurs as three isolated subpopulations, separated by unsuitable habitat. It is unlikely that the species disperses between these areas, restricting the flow of genetic material. Although the species is conspicuous where it occurs, periodic opportunistic sightings in Mutawinji have recorded fewer than 50 animals in total (Sass and Swan 2010). These authors recorded a total of 209 individuals observed in surveys between 2007 and 2008 at the Silverton wind farm site, an area of approximately 30,000 ha, suggesting that this is likely to be the largest subpopulation of this species. Fifteen animals were found in a recent survey of Koonenberry Mountain, from which the species was previously known only from a single museum specimen (G. Swan and M.

Occasional surveys of the Koonenberry Mountain&#160;site, where a single record was obtained in the 1970s, did not record the species until 2017, where it was found to occur only at the top of the mountain (G. Swan and M. Irvin, unpubl. data), suggesting a highly localized occurrence in this area.

Although it is presumably declining in proportion to deforestation, rates of outright conversion in the hill evergreen areas of northern Southeast Asia remain low; although lowland plains populations are doubtless in steep decline in some areas, the averaged global decline is unlikely to approach rates appropriate for categorisation&#160;even&#160;as Near Threatened over the most recent or forthcoming three generations (taken as 19 years). Even though hunting-induced declines in&#160;Lao PDR and Viet Nam&#160;might warrant a regionally-specific&#160;listing of at least&#160;Near Threatened, they are offset by the status of this species in areas&#160;such as Northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, where hunting threats are somewhat to considerably lower. Although some increase in hunting in the next three generations is likely in Myanmar and particularly Cambodia, because (i) these constitute less than a third of the range and (ii) even in&#160;Lao PDR and&#160;Viet Nam the species persists in extremely heavily hunted areas and is still recorded widely, it is unlikely that future decline rates from both hunting and habitat loss averaged across the world range would be steep enough to warrant categorisation even as Near Threatened.&#160;No other threats have been identified that could be leading to a significant decline in the species.","Crab-eating Mongoose occurs across a wide range of habitats, often near water, in evergreen and deciduous forest, scrubby areas, plantations, agricultural fields and near human settlements (Pham-Chong-Ahn 1980, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1997, Van Rompaey 2001, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Thapa 2013). It also occurs in tall savanna grassland in areas such as Kaziranga and Manas National Parks in Assam (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014). It has been recorded up to&#160;at least&#160;1,800 m asl (Jennings and Veron 2011). It is  diurnal, despite earlier statements that it was nocturnal.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, this species is found in evergreen forest (including degraded areas), mainly near water; most of the recent records are from hill and mountainous areas (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Thailand, Cambodia and southern Viet Nam this species is found in&#160;similar habitats and&#160;also in deciduous forest and down to the plains (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). In India it occurs&#160;in lowland wet evergreen forest, secondary forest and areas around industrial areas (e.g., oil refineries). In&#160;some countries, there are records from rice fields and other agricultural areas, and even near human settlements (Pham-Chong-Ahn 1980, Thapa 2013). Little is known about its breeding, although the gestation period is thought to be about nine weeks; probably meaning that this species reproduces more slowly than does <em>Herpestes javanicus </em>(sensu lato; Lekagul and McNeely 1977). It feeds on fish, frogs, crabs, molluscs, insects and crayfish (Van Rompaey 2001). <br/><br/>In some areas it is readily approached by people because of&#160;its apparent near-sightedness (Van Rompaey 2001) and fearlessness (Pocock 1941), but in areas where hunting with projectiles and/or dogs is common it is shy and not approachable, e.g. Lao PDR (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014). It has lived up to 13 years and four months in captivity (Jones 1982). Wang and Fuller (2001) studied its&#160;ecology in a rural agricultural area of southeastern China (near the village&#160;of&#160;Taohong in northern Jiangxi province), from April 1993 to November 1994. Wang and Fuller (2003) studied its food habits in this area&#160;between June 1992 and November 1994, by analysing its faeces; it ate mammals, reptiles, insects and crustaceans. In Taiwan, Chuang and Lee (1997) found that it ate mainly crustaceans, insects, amphibians and reptiles. It remains little studied elsewhere.","In northern Southeast Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, southeast China and perhaps Myanmar), hunting is probably the main potential threat to Crab-eating Mongoose. This is widespread and intense, particularly in Lao PDR and Viet Nam but, even there, this species persists widely, including in areas with heavy human use. As a ground-dwelling animal, potentially suffering from widespread market-driven trapping in this region (where many other species have declined steeply), this suggests a strong resilience. However, it is evidently absent from, or at least very rare in, the plains of Lao PDR. These are more accessible&#160;than are the hills&#160;and, in general, hunting of mammals has been even more damaging in them. The rarity or absence there of&#160;Crab-eating Mongoose&#160;might reflect hunting-led extirpation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); this is probably more likely than a natural absence from such areas, given the species' occurrence in lowland plains parts of Cambodia and Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). There is no demand for its meat in restaurants in Viet Nam (S. Roberton pers. comm. 2008) and no evidence of directed hunting of the species. Retaliatory killing for raiding poultry on farms occurs, but is not a&#160;population-level&#160;threat.&#160;There are no records from wholly agricultural or otherwise anthropogenic landscapes, indicating a degree of dependence on forest. Many recent records are, however, from highly fragmented and/or degraded forest. In Nepal and, formerly, in Viet Nam there are records from agricultural land (Pham-Chong-Anh 1980, Thapa 2013); nowadays, in its core range of northern Southeast Asia,&#160;such areas are mostly&#160;heavily hunted and are unlikely to support resident populations. It is possible that the species is widely excluded from farmland by hunting. In sum, with the exclusion of outright deforestation, the threats to this species from habitat change (degradation and fragmentation) are mainly indirect, through the increased hunting and trading that occurs in accompaniment over most of Southeast Asia.","Crab-eating Mongoose is common in Northeast India, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand (Choudhury 1997ab,&#160;Duckworth 1997,&#160;Choudhury&#160;1999, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).  However, in some parts of the periphery of its range, it is believed to be uncommon, e.g. Jalpaiguiri District, Bengal, India (Inglis <em>et al</em>. 1919), Bangladesh (Khan 1982), Nepal (Thapa 2013) and Malaysia (Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species is one of the most frequently detected small carnivores during both camera-trapping and direct-observation surveys (the majority of data unpublished) in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, in quite a sharp contrast to another ground-dwelling species of similar habitat use, Large Indian Civet <em>Viverra zibetha</em>; this is highly suggestive of much greater resiliency to the current levels of hunting pressure (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).",Decreasing,"Crab-eating Mongoose is found in southeast China including Taiwan, Nepal, Bhutan,&#160;Bangladesh,&#160;Northeast India and all countries of mainland Southeast Asia (e.g., Duckworth 1997, Van Rompaey 2001, Wang and Fuller 2001,&#160;Wang and Fuller&#160;2003, Duckworth and Robichaud 2005, Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Jennings and Veron 2011, Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2011, Choudhury 2013, Thapa 2013).

Declines have been reported almost entirely across the species’ range. Also, genetic depletion of fragmented populations has been observed in Central Europe. Ongoing habitat destructions in more recently adhered EU member states such as Romania, Bulgaria and also Serbia, the latter also about to face an increased destruction of grassland habitats in the near future. The range and habitats of the species are mostly not protected and the accession of Romania to the EU has already resulted in agricultural intensification, which has also affected other steppic rodent taxa, and has a severe impact on the European ground squirrel. Further agricultural intensification is suspected to cause additional decline in extent of occurrence and quality of habitat within the next 10 years. Overall, known or suspected population reduction in the past, and suspected future population reduction likely over 50%.</p>","The European Souslik has quite specific habitat requirements. It is restricted to short-grass steppe and similar artificial habitats (pastures, airfields, lawns, sports fields, golf courses) on light, well-drained soils, where it can excavate its burrows (Kryštufek 1999, Spitzenberger 2002).&#160;Roadsides and river banks are very important habitats in some regions (e.g. southern Romania), where they are virtually the last remaining grassland habitats in large stretches of land, and could also serve as important corridors for ground squirrels and other grassland species.&#160;It avoids cultivated land, except for vineyards in some parts of its range (Spitzenberger 2002). It has an omnivorous diet including seeds, roots, shoots, flowers, and arthropods (Nowak 1999, Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).","The main threats to this species are the conversion of steppe-grassland and pasture to cultivated fields or forestry, and the abandonment of pasture and its subsequent reversion to tall-grass meadows or scrubby habitats which are not suitable for the souslik (Kryštufek 1999). In Austria it is therefore largely restricted to vineyards, airstrips, golflinks, sport- and camping grounds and other frequently mown lawns where it is completely dependent on the toleration of the owners (Spitzenberger 2002). In Bulgaria, colonies in the Sofia area are threatened by new road and building construction and in the Thracian valley the pasture habitat is being degraded (Koshev 2008). Although not a major threat, some Gypsy communities in central and eastern Europe still catch sousliks for use as a traditional meal (J. Mateju pers. comm. 2006).&#160;The bulk of European ground squirrel populations is currently found in four countries: Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia. The former two are relatively recent EU member states, with drastically intensified agriculture and weak nature conservation legislature. With the EU accession of Serbia, it is expected that grassland conversion to arable land will be similarly drastic to the one experienced in Romania (Hegyeli <em>et al. </em>2014). Populations from Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic are highly dependent on the conscious and targeted management of their habitats, especially since grazing activity has shown a remarkable decrease with the reduction of farm animals, and since many colonies live in anthropic habitats such as airfields or golf courses (e.g. Matějů <em>et al.</em> 2010a).<br/><br/>In Austria intensification of agriculture has led to a decline of populations (Spitzenberger 2005). In Bulgaria pasture abandonment has led to a serious decline of habitats (Stoychev<em> et al.</em> 2004). Kryštufek <em>et al. </em>(2012) found the North Macedonian population to be threatened by pasture abandonment, spread of shrubs as burning. In post EU accession Hungary, the drastic decline of livestock and subsequent abandonment of grazing has led to sometimes irreversible deterioration of grassland habitats, leading to local extinctions or serious population declines. In Romania, many pastures traditionally grazed with cattle have recently seen a shift towards sheep grazing, leading to overgrazing and a more monotonous habitat composition, which probably affects the species. In this country, direct persecution is still an important factor: there is a high number of pest control firms which also undertake European ground squirrel control by means of poisoning and gassing of burrows, and in some places water management authorities use gassing of burrows to destroy populations on river embankments (Tihamér Fülöp and Zsolt Hegyeli, unpublished).<br/><br/>The role of fragmentation has been suggested by Řičanová <em>et al. </em>(2011), with important differences in allele frequencies between eastern and western population. Ćosić <em>et al.</em> (2013) have found that despite heavy fragmentation in Voivodina, genetic variation was higher than peripheral populations in Central Europe.<br/><br/>In the pannonian region of Romania, 40% of known colonies have been affected by transformation to arable land and 17% by constructions since Romania’s EU adherence, often within protected areas. In fact, inclusion in protected areas did not diminish these threats at all (Hegyeli <em>et al. </em>2014). Two projects aimed at ground squirrel and Saker Falcon (<em>Falco cherrug</em>) conservation (LIFE09NAT/HU/00384 and LIFE13NAT/HU/000183) have both had several protected target populations destroyed by illegal ploughing, despite continuous communication between the project staff and authorities. Destruction of grasslands as a result of agriculture intensification, forest plantations and constructions is still an ongoing cause of local extinctions, and an increasing threat in all lowland and hillside areas of Romania, even more so since grassland protection and nature conservation laws are rarely enforced. Baltag<em> et al.</em> (2014) found pasture degradation, building up and flooding to be the most significant threats for ground squirrels in eastern Romania. In the Voivodina region of Serbia, populations are also fragmented due to habitat conversion and infrastructure, and the small patches of suitable habitat are often outside of protected areas (Nicolić <em>et al. </em>2014).","Currently, the European Souslik is in serious decline. Its population has become fragmented, and extinctions have occurred in peripheral parts of its range in Germany (where it went extinct <em>ca</em> 1985 because of forestry) and Poland (where the last definite autochthonous records date from the 1970s, although the species has recently been reintroduced (Kryštufek 1999, H. Meinig pers. comm. 2006, A. Gondek pers. comm. 2006)). Although there are still some large and apparently stable subpopulations, there have been many reports of declines, especially in the north-western part of its range; it is also declining in the southern part of the range.&#160;In western Romania, the species (or its suitable habitats) could not be reconfirmed in 29 grids of 10x10 km (54% of all occupied grids), while this figure was 129 (60%) for regions east and south of the Carpathians (Hegyeli <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In optimal habitat, densities of 18-48 individuals per hectare have been recorded, although lower figures of 5-14 individuals per hectare are also reported (Kryštufek 1999).&#160;In Romania, a mean spring density of 110 burrows/ha has been recorded in Bărăgan region (Muntenia), and 136 in southern Moldavia, and even in 220 in Dobruja (Hegyeli, unpublished). Baltag<em> et el. </em>(2014) found lower densities across Moldavia (mean 15.4 ind./ha). In western Romania, summer burrow densities of 144/ha have been found, with slightly lower spring densities (projects LIFE09NAT/HU/00384 and LIFE13NAT/HU/000183).&#160;In Greece, populations of two subspecies (<em>macedonicus</em> and <em>graolojenici</em>) have been lost (B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>In the Czech Republic there were 83 known localities in 1995, but by 2000-2001 only 26 of them still existed (Cepáková and Hulová 2002). Since 2001, there has been regular monitoring of <em>S. citellus</em>. Five new sites have been found, six colonies have disappeared, one was re-established due to reintroduction and one site has been naturally colonized following conservation  management. Fluctuation or stagnation of abundance has been observed at eleven sites, numbers of sousliks have steadily decreased at seven sites, and only in five colonies have populations increased. In 2006 the total number of <em>S. citellus</em> living in the Czech Republic was estimated at 2,750 (J. Mateju unpublished data). In North Macedonia the species is found in an area of 884 ha on Mount Jakupica, where densities (0.8–5.5 adults ha<sup>-1</sup>) are lower than those reported elsewhere for the species, and a total population of approximately 2,000 adults (Kryštufek <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).",Decreasing,"The European Souslik is endemic to central and south-eastern Europe, where it occurs at altitudes of 0–2,500 m.

Overall, the global population is estimated to be declining at such a rate that the species qualifies as Near Threatened. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is highly gregarious and migrates on a broad front, making long-distance flights often overland between relatively few staging and wintering areas<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It breeds from April to mid-June in loose, semi-colonial groups of up to 3 pairs per ha (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Non-breeding birds remain in flocks, often near to the breeding colonies. As soon as the young fledge, breeding birds begin to congregate in loose flocks which can be many thousands strong (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. The species migrates southwards between late-June and October. During the autumn migration it may roost in flocks of tens of thousands at favoured sites<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996), and this is the main moulting period for adult birds. The <em>islandica&#160;</em>subspecies moults in northwest Europe, while western populations of the nominate subspecies often moult in north Morrocco (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016), and many adults pause in north Morocco in July to moult. Huge flocks occur at some wintering sites, particularly in the floodplains of Lake Chad.&#160;The return passage occurs between February and April<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1996), and birds arrive at the breeding grounds in groups of 5-30 individuals (Johnsgard 1981)<strong></strong>. Many one-year-old birds remain in the wintering range during the summer. During the winter and migration the species usually forages gregariously<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> In its breeding range it mostly inhabits areas with high but not dense grass and soft soil<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996, Johnsgard 1981,&#160;Schekkerman and Beintema 2007, Tomkovich and Lebedeva 1998), occasionally using sandy areas; although other information suggests it may prefer short vegetation (Laursen and Hald 2012). Its preferred habitats include cattle pastures, hayfields (Johnsgard 1981), lowland wet grasslands, grassy marshland, raised bogs and moorland, lake margins and damp grassy depressions in steppes<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1996). Subspecies <em>islandica </em>shows a distinct preference for large patches of dwarf-birch bog and marsh, particularly with abundant sedge-pools<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996, Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2006). Extensive farmland habitats are of critical importance for breeding Western European populations<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996), with y<span lang=""NL"">oung, that grow up in herb-rich meadows recruiting to the breeding population 2.5 times better than young that grow up in monocultures (Kentie <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In intensively managed grasslands small shallow pools attract breeding godwits and, in combination with herb rich meadows, may improve breeding succes (Weterings <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;After the young have fledged, adults and fledglings often move to secondary habitat which more closely resembles that of their non-breeding range, including wet damp areas around fish-ponds and sewage farms, tidal marshes, mud flats and salt-water lagoons (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, Tucker and Heath 1994)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>Subspecies <em>limosa </em>tends to winter in freshwater habitats<strong></strong>, including swampy lake shores, pools, flooded grassland and irrigated rice fields<strong></strong>. Subspecies <em>islandica </em>and <em>melanuroides</em>, however,<em> </em>often winter in saline habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996) such as sheltered estuaries and lagoons with large intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), sandy beaches, salt-marshes and salt-flats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996). Despite these general differences there is considerable overlap in wintering habitat between sympatric populations of subspecies <span style=""font-style: italic;"">limosa</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">islandica</span> (Alves <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Lopes <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Seasonally-flooded grassland is a critical habitat for the birds wintering in Ireland (Hayhow 2008). Birds on passage in Iberia make much use of rice fields (Lourenço <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (especially beetles), annelid and polychaete worms, molluscs, ragworms, crustaceans, spiders, fish eggs, and the spawn and tadpoles of frogs<strong> </strong>(Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996). On the breeding grounds grasshoppers and other orthopterans are often prevalent in the diet (Johnsgard 1981). Particularly during the winter and on migration it will also take plant material including berries, seeds and rice grains<strong> </strong>(Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, Lourenço <em>et al. </em>2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. On its wintering grounds in Portugal, the bivalve <em>Scrobicularia plana</em> has been found to represent its primary food source (Moreira 1994), while&#160;in the salinas of Spain, it mainly feeds on chironomid larvae (Estrella and Masero 2010).&#160;<span lang=""NL""><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is placed on the ground in short, often luxurious vegetation<strong> </strong>(Johnsgard 1981, Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It consists of a shallow scrape 12-15cm in diameter, lined with a thick mat of stem grass, leaves and other available vegetation (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983). Breeding birds show a high degree of nest site fidelity<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996) and some degree of natal philopatry (Kruk <em>et al.</em> 1998) which is more pronounced among males (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2011). <p></p></span>","Loss of nesting habitat owing to wetland drainage and agricultural intensification, and conversely abandonment in some parts of the range, are the most significant threats (Mischenko 2008,&#160;Kentie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land and loss of habitat to development (Tucker and Heath 1994), increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland&#160;(Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), earlier and more frequent cutting as farmers adapt to climate change (Kleijn&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010), spring burning and scrub encroachment (A. Mischenko&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007)&#160;and possibly disturbance by walkers (Holm and Laursen 2009). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of egg and chick mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Kentie <em>et al. </em>2015). On intensively grazed pastures, trampling is a major cause of nest loss, and a switch to monoculture on arable land reduces the supply of insects on which the species feeds (Kentie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to silage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">A study in<span lang=""EN-US""> the central regions of <span lang=""EN-US"">European Russia suggests that<span lang=""EN-US""> <span lang=""EN-US"">significant decline in spring flood levels during two last decades, as a result climate change, has <span lang=""EN-US"">strengthened<span lang=""EN-US""> the negative impact of agricultural abandonment (<span lang=""EN-US"">A.

Indeed, sink locations have been documented for the species, where birds recruited from good quality habitat disperse to low quality habitats (often suffering high predation) effectively losing these individuals to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Leigh&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1980, Reijnen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996<strong></strong>). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)<strong></strong>.&#160;The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestion of the lowland habitats where they breed and from ongoing agricultural expansion (Gunnarsson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Gill&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007), although this population has been increasing strongly over recent decades (BirdLife International 2015).<br/>Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture, urban expansion and agricultural intensification at rice paddies. The proposed development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Masero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the European Union (EU) in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2008), which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, for example on the African wintering grounds, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact is unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species range (H. Hötker <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, although the effects of the release of some pollutants, like untreated sewage, on this species may be minor as long as there are several alternative prey present at a site (Alves <em>et al. </em>2012). In Egypt there are plans to increase the depth of the sailing channel of the Nile, impacting upon this species's habitat there (H. Ibrahim&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994) in conjunction with the extensive drainage of wetlands in this area, for energy production, water storage and agriculture (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Invasive plants may also degrade wintering habitat in Australia (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Studies of <em>islandica</em> godwits have shown that individuals breeding in the habitats where productivity is higher also winter in the areas where survival is higher (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds.&#160;<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).<strong>&#160;</strong>The population is estimated to number&#160;102,000-149,000 pairs&#160;in Europe (including 25,000 pairs in Iceland) (BirdLife International 2015); 25,000-100,000 in west-central Asia; 150,000 in central Asia and Siberia (Asian Waterbird Census unpublished data); 160,000 in the rest of Asia and Australia.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;has a large discontinuous breeding range extending from Iceland to the Russian far east, with wintering populations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Australasia<strong> </strong>(Van Gils <em>et al. </em>2017). It occurs as three subspecies, <em>L. l. islandica</em>, <em>L. l. limosa</em>, and <em>L. l. melanuroides</em>. Subspecies<em> islandica </em>breeds predominantly in <strong>Iceland</strong>, with much smaller numbers in the <strong>Faeroe Islands</strong>, Shetland (<strong>United Kingdom</strong>) and the Lofoten Islands (<strong>Norway</strong>). This subspecies winters in roughly similar numbers in the <strong>Republic of Ireland</strong>, the United Kingdom, <strong>France, Spain</strong>&#160;and <strong>Portugal</strong>, with small numbers in the <strong>Netherlands</strong> (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016). Subspecies<em> limosa </em>breeds across a wide area extending from Western Europe and central Europe to central Asia<strong> </strong>and Asiatic Russia, as far east as the River Yenisey. The west European population of this subspecies migrates south through France and Iberia to winter largely in West Africa, while eastern breeding birds winter in southeast Europe to the Middle East, and may also be the origin of wintering birds in <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Chad</strong> and northern <strong>Cameroon</strong> (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Oomen 2008, Lourenço &amp; Piersma 2008b).&#160;Subspecies<em> melanuroides </em>breeds in disjunct populations in <strong>Mongolia, </strong>northern <strong>China</strong>, Siberia (<strong>Russia</strong>) and the Russian Far East. These birds migrates across a broad front to winter from western South Asia to <strong>A</strong><strong>ustralia</strong>, encompassing&#160;<strong>India</strong>, Indochina, <strong>Taiwan, </strong>the <strong>Philippines, Indonesia, </strong>and Melanesia (Dutson 2011, Van Gils&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).<strong>&#160;</strong><br/>Population trends vary across the range. There have been large and well-documented declines in the mainland European breeding population (of the nominate subspecies) of between 50-60% (BirdLife International 2015). For example, in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>&#160;the population decreased dramatically from 120,000-135,000 pairs in 1969 and 85,000-100,000 pairs in 1989-1991, to just 46,000-62,000 in 2009 (Tucker and Heath 1994,&#160;<strong><sup> </sup></strong>BirdLife International 2004a, <strong></strong>EU Technical Report 19 2007, Oomen 2008, Höglund <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009), 35,200-59,800 pairs in 2008-2011 (BirdLife International 2015), and potentially to 33,000 pairs in 2015 (Kentie <em>et al. </em>2016). In certain areas though, the breeding population has recently stabilised as a result of agri-environmental measures (Oosterveld <em>et al. </em>2016). These declines are mirrored in the information from West African wintering areas, with notable declines in Senegal and Morocco, while further east (Mali, Chad and north Cameroon) wintering numbers appear stable, though data is sparser (Lourenço and Piersma 2008b). This is true also for the central Asian breeding population, which is thought to be stable of fluctuating (L. Belyalova<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>, but for which there is little recent data.&#160;In the eastern flyway, declines have been estimated at between 20-30% over three generations on the species Australian wintering grounds (Garnett <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010)<strong></strong>, which hold c. 50% of the wintering population of <em>L. l. melanuroides</em><strong> </strong>(Watkins 1993).&#160;The population of <em>L. l. ilsandica, </em>in contrast, has be increasing dramatically over the past few decades, although this increase may be levelling out and the subpopulation represents a relatively small part of the global population (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Wetlands International in press)<strong></strong>.&#160;A recent analysis based on published literature, survey data and expert opinions from throughout the species range suggests that, overall, the global population may have declined at a mean rate of approximately 23% over 25 years leading up to 2015 (I.

An EU management plan for 2007-2009 was adopted, and an AEWA action plan replaced it at the end of 2008 (Anon. 2008). Intensive management of breeding habitat has been carried out in some Western European countries (H. Hötker <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, and a number of agri-environment schemes focus on this species, although results have been mixed (Musters <em>et al.</em> 2001, S. Nagy <em>in litt. </em>2005,<sup>&#160;</sup>A. Mischenko <em>in litt. </em>2007, Verhulst <em>et al.</em> 2007). A number of significant wintering areas are protected areas, as are several breeding sites in the UK and the Netherlands.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Obtain more quantitative data on status, population trends and conservation requirements outside Europe. Carry out research on survival, recruitment, breeding and migration (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Critically evaluate the effectiveness of current conservation action. In the EU, use a mixture of agri-environment schemes, direct payments to wader-friendly farmers (Musters <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2001) and large reserves to secure protection and appropriate management of breeding habitat. The coverage of agri-environment schemes in Europe should be increased (Kleijn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and increases in groundwater depth should be prioritised as an outcome (Verhulst <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). New nature reserves should be established on important sites throughout the species range, and there should be attempts to get greater coverage of key areas for this species within in the Special Protection Areas network (van der Vliet <em>et al. </em>2015).  Manage existing reserves appropriately: prescriptions include avoiding drainage of existing wet meadows, raising water tables where necessary, low-level use of organic fertiliser, low intensity grazing, late mowing, and prevention of succession to bushy vegetation. Winter flooding is sometimes recommended but may reduce numbers of invertebrate prey (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2005). On intensively farmed land, maintenance of unfertilised field margins has been shown to have positive effects (Oosterveld <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Investigate the potential for using a 'headstarting' approach to increase survival to fledging (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016). Prevent afforestation of lowland breeding habitat in Iceland. Prevent a loss of key breeding areas due to abandonment of grasslands and meadows in east Europe and Russian Far East. Monitor human disturbance as a threat.&#160;<br/>Ensure that migratory staging posts and winter feeding habitats and roosts are conserved and monitored, and knowledge of them is improved (Estrella and Masero 2010). Designate a special protection area at Extremadura's rice fields, which is a key stopover site (Masero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Manage artificial habitats appropriately, e.g. maintain low water levels in salinas such that they are available to foraging godwits (Estrella and Masero 2010), and block drainage to retain water in Iberian rice fields (Lourenço and Piersma 2008a). Protect important Yellow Sea tidal flats in China and South Korea. Engage with governments and local people throughout its migration routes. Effectively enforce the EU-wide ban on hunting until there is clear evidence that the population has returned to a favourable conservation status. Safeguard habitats in West Africa and Iberia, perhaps by offering support to rice producers (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Collaborate with farmers and hunters, carrying out environmental education and outreach work where appropriate. Restore wetland sites in Australia (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).

Its moderately small remaining population continues to decline and as a result it is considered Near Threatened. <p></p>,"This species breeds in the high Arctic on well drained tundra with tussocks and scant vegetation. It is generally not found near the sea and avoids marshes. It appears to depend heavily upon intensive grazing by livestock in its wintering grounds to create short grassland (Lanctot <em>et al.</em> 2002, Aldabe 2016)<strong></strong>, but also uses flooded pampas grasslands (Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lanctot <em>et al</em>. 2004). During migration it is found on many short grass habitats (McCarty <em>et al</em>. 2009, Norling <em>et al</em>. 2012). At the internationally important Rainwater Basin stopover site in Nebraska, U.S.A., it was observed to feed primarily in agricultural land (soybeans, corn), and use wetlands for resting (McCarty <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). It is a lekking species. <p></p>","The species was severely overhunted in the late 1800s and the early part of the 1900s, reportedly declining to near extinction from a population which may have numbered in the hundreds of thousands to millions.&#160;The breeding grounds may be affected by habitat loss and degradation, and environmental contaminants (R. Lanctot<em> in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Previously, on-going declines were attributed to widespread and continuing destruction of grasslands in the wintering range (Lanctot and Laredo 1994, Lanctot 1995)<strong></strong>, but there seems to be little evidence to support this, although environmental contaminants may be playing a part there (R. Lanctot<em> in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Exposure on migration to toxic chemicals and pollutants in its agricultural feeding grounds may pose a threat, and is being investigated further (Lanctot 2006, McCarty <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009)<strong></strong>.Conservation threats faced by the species vary throughout the annual cycle. On the breeding grounds, habitat is being lost or degraded due to energy production (extraction of oil and gas and associated development) and climate change (Lanctot <em>et al</em>., 2010). Climate change may also be affecting demographic parameters but the overall effects are unclear. Negative effects on Buff-breasted Sandpiper productivity may occur due to the decoupling of the apparent synchrony between the breeding chronology of &#160;the birds and food availability (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2010). Alternatively, climate change could lengthen the growing season, providing flexibility for birds to initiate or replace lost clutches (although this may be more common in Calidrids that do not have a lek mating system), as well as promote survival of chicks – enhancements that could provide an overall positive or neutral effect (Lanctot <em>et al</em>., 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>During migration, Buff-breasted Sandpipers may be negatively impacted from wind energy installations in the Great Plains/Midwest of the central United States and in coastal portions of the Gulf of Mexico (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2010). The short vegetation required by the species is being lost through management of native grasslands for medium to tall vegetation, a reduction in the size of intact grassland units and the conversion of native grasslands or pastures to agriculture and other human development (Lanctot <em>et al</em>., 2010). Agricultural conversion could lead to altered prey availability and increased exposure to pesticides and herbicides. However, little to no quantitative data are available to suggest birds using human-altered habitats have altered migration abilities, lowered survival rates, or affected any other measurable demographic trait. Climate change may also affect the species during migration by increasing the severity of storms over the western Atlantic that could directly impact survival rates of juveniles, which predominately use this pathway during southbound migration (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2010).<br/><br/>On the non-breeding range, Buff-breasted Sandpipers are threatened by conversion of historic grasslands into agriculture, wood plantations, mines, and tourist locations. Pastures are also being “improved” by ranchers planting exotic vegetation with a different vegetation structure that appears to be less preferred. Such improvements frequently involve applications of fertilizer and other contaminants that may negatively affect the species. Buff-breasted Sandpipers are also vulnerable to changes in ranch management that reduce grazing levels and result in pastures with tall vegetation. Finally, climate change may result in sea-level rise and greater precipitation, which will inundate the many low-lying areas used by the species during the non-breeding season.","Originally numbering in the hundreds of thousands to millions (1890s-1900s), the species was brought to near extinction in the early 1920s by habitat destruction and hunting.

Individuals have been found crawling out of bromeliads and under rotten logs, which act as daytime refugia (Townsend 2016). It is not likely to tolerate habitat disturbance (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). It is expected to reproduce by direct development, as with other congeners.","In Texiguat, the major threats to this species include high rates of deforestation and encroachment in the wildlife refuge for extensive cattle ranching and coffee plantations, agricultural crops (e.g., beans, avocado), including in the core area, illegal selective logging for hardwoods, followed by clear-cutting along the same access routes (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Another threat includes the construction of several small-scale hydroelectric dams (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). There is a proposal to shift the core part of the refuge (which currently is at 1,250 m asl) upslope, which would create a much larger buffer zone where habitat conversion can progress unabated (C. Antúnez and J. Ramos Galdámez pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Climate change is also considered to be a threat. Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabitat a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Honduras (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).","It is infrequently encountered, and it is often only single individuals that are found (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).

Another individual has also been found at 970 m asl (J.&#160;Ramos-Galdamez&#160;pers. comm. March 2019).&#160;It is an endemic to Texiguat, and is highly unlikely to be found elsewhere (J.

The conservation status of&#160;<em>C. boulengeri</em>&#160;was considered to be Least Concern on the 1996 IUCN Red List (TTWG 2014, 2017), but as possibly Vulnerable at a Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group Red Listing workshop in late 2013. It was subsequently listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2017 based on an earlier 2013 assessment (Hofmeyr and Baard 2014, Bates <em>et al</em>. 2014). Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2017 indicated that most localities (30 of 35) where populations previously occurred no longer harbor viable populations and that the species is no longer being found by farmers. Habitat destruction and degradation maps of South Africa (Hoffman <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999) show that nearly 50% of the range of <em>C. boulengeri</em> is either moderately or severely degraded, which may explain the species’ decline.&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;boulengeri</em> is associated with rocky outcrops in specific vegetation types, qualifying it as a habitat specialist, which increases its risk of extinction. The documented population declines will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change and associated vegetation change. Monitoring over recent decades showed that grasses are invading the Karoo, replacing the dwarf shrubs, with an increasing fire-hazard in the habitat (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Nama-Karoo is considered the second most threatened biome in South Africa under all climate scenarios. Predictions are that savanna and desert vegetation will expand into large portions of the current biome (Driver <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2012; DEA 2013). Such changes would intensify grazing pressure by livestock and reduce food and cover for tortoises. Predation by baboons was high at one site visited during surveys (M. Hofmeyr pers. obs.) and crow predation may be on the increase (Juvik and Hofmeyr 2015). A serious new emerging threat involves shale gas exploration and development, which would require  substantial large-scale infrastructure to support the drilling and operation of  wells and extraction sites.  Based on these factors, <em>C. boulengeri</em>&#160;is assessed as Endangered under criterion A4ace, based on an estimate of a reduction in population size of approximately 30% over the past 25 years (one generation), and a projected reduction of at least another 30% over the next 50 years (two generations), for a total reduction over three generations of approximately 60%.</p>","<p><em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;boulengeri</em> occurs in association with dolerite ridges and rocky outcrops of the southern Succulent and Nama Karoo biomes, and peripherally in the Albany Thicket biome in the southeast, at altitudes of approximately 800 to 1,500 m. Annual rainfall is low (approximately 150 to 400 mm over the species’ range) and relatively unpredictable with a coefficient of variation between 35 and 40% (Schulze 1997). Most of the range receives late summer rains. Temperatures are mild to hot and the incidence of frost is high in the interior. Occurs in dwarf shrubland that often contains succulent and grassy elements. The tortoises usually take shelter under rocks in vegetated areas or in rock crevices (Boycott and Bourquin 2000), but few rocky sites over the range offer suitable retreats for the species (V. Loehr and M.D. Hofmeyr pers. obs.). Females nest in summer and have single-egg clutches (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). No information exists on age at maturity and longevity, but based on the life history of&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;signatus</em>&#160;(Loehr&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007), female&#160;<em>C. boulengeri</em>&#160;are expected to mature at 10-12 years of age.</p>","<p>The main past and current threat to&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;boulengeri</em> appears to be habitat degradation. Drought and agricultural overgrazing also threaten the species' habitat. Climate change maps indicate future changes under all scenarios to habitats in the southern and eastern distribution range of the species (Driver <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2012). Crows and baboons pose another threat because, due to the small size of the species, these predators can exploit adult tortoises. A serious new threat involves shale gas exploration, which would require substantial infrastructure to support the drilling and operation of wells and large-scale extraction sites. </p>","<em>Chersobius boulengeri</em>&#160;is a&#160;habitat specialist and&#160;population densities&#160;are <a>low</a>. Populations are isolated on rocky outcrops with specialized vegetation. We expect that their movement potential is low, similar to <em>C. signatus</em> (Loehr 2015). Between 2005 and 2017, we launched 10 separate surveys to localities where the species had been documented previously, covering 35 different sites and spending approximately 988 person-hours on searches (Loehr, Hofmeyr, and Juvik unpubl. data). We found a single site with a population that could be considered viable, four live tortoises and a few shells at four other sites, with no sign of the species at the remaining 30 sites. Our surveys covered <a>approximately 50% of the species’ westerly distribution</a>. During each field trip, farmers and their employees indicated that they seldom, or no longer, encountered these tortoises, or that they had never seen them on their farms or even in their region.

The species departs its wintering grounds again from February through to May, although non-breeders may remain in the wintering areas all-year-round (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. During the winter the species usually forages singly or in small groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> occasionally aggregating into flocks of several thousand individuals, especially at roosting sites (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on upland moors, peat bogs, swampy and dry heathlands, fens, open grassy or boggy areas in forests, damp grasslands, meadows (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, non-intensive farmland in river valleys<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>, dune valleys and coastal marshlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) <em>Non-breeding</em> During the winter the species frequents muddy coasts, bays and estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> with tidal mudflats and sandflats (Snow and Perrins 1998), rocky and sandy beaches with many pools (Johnsgard 1981,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Snow and Perrins 1998), mangroves, saltmarshes (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal meadows and pasture (Johnsgard 1981, Navedo <em>et al. </em>2013) and muddy shores of coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981), inland lakes and rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It also utilises wet grassland and arable fields during migration (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists chiefly of annelid worms and terrestrial insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera and Orthoptera) (Johnsgard 1981) especially during the summer (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), although it will also take crustaceans, molluscs, polychaete worms (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, spiders (Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, berries and seeds, as well as occasionally small fish, amphibians, lizards, young birds and small rodents (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression on the ground or on a mound (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong></strong> in the open or in the cover of grass or sedge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Management information</strong> A study into the effects of shellfish harvesting by hand in coastal intertidal habitats recommends that the harvesting load should be limited to -1 during this species's autumn migration (Navedo and Masero 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","The species is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of moorland habitats as a result of afforestation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and of marginal grassland habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and improvement (Johnsgard 1981,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Baines 1988,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) (e.g. drainage, inorganic fertilisation and reseeding) (Baines 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species also suffers from high egg and chick mortalities due to agricultural practices (e.g. Tuellinghoff &amp; Bergmann 1993, Grant 1997, Fisher &amp; Walker 2015) human disturbance (Boschert and Rupp 1993) and higher predation rates if nesting on improved grasslands or in fragmented landscapes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Valkama and Korpimäki 1999, Douglas <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Conversely some populations have declined following abandonment of farmland and subsequent increases in the height of vegetation (Broyer and Roche 1991), rendering large areas unsuitable for nesting. Climate change is projected to have a large negative impact on this species during the breeding season (Huntley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Renwick <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Expansion of renewable energy projects including wind farms can also have an impact although more studies are required (Pearce-Higgins <em>et al.</em> 2009).

Subramanya (<em>in litt.</em> 2006) has suggested that the population in South India now exceeds 5,000 birds owing to increases resulting from improved protection of the species, and the latest figures from Andhra Pradesh and Telangara suggest that there are &gt;10,000 individuals in those states alone (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;The global population is currently placed in the range 13,000-18,000 individuals globally, roughly equivalent to 8,700-12,000 mature individuals, though this may require revising upwards in the future.",Decreasing,"<em>Pelecanus philippensis</em> was formerly common across much of Asia, but suffered a widespread decline (BirdLife International 2001). However, owing to protection and increased knowledge its estimated population has been revised upwards from a low of 5,500-10,000 birds in 2002 to an estimated 13,000-18,000 individuals in 2006. Known breeding populations are now confined to <strong>India,</strong> <strong>Sri Lanka </strong>and<strong> Cambodia</strong>, and potentially also <strong>Thailand </strong>(W. Limparungpatthanakij <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Indian population<strong> </strong>is thought to exceed 5,000 birds in the south owing to increases resulting from improved protection of the species (S. Subramanya <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, plus c.3,000 in Assam (Choudhury 2000)<strong></strong>. In southern India there are 21 known breeding colonies in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu (Subramanya 2006)<strong></strong>. One of these at Kokkare Bellur, Karnataka, has doubled in size in recent years (Subramanya 2006), and recent surveys in southern India have located more pairs than were previously estimated for the state (Gokula 2011, Anon. 2012). However, another at Uppalapadu has declined from a historical high of 12,000 individuals, with only 1,500 observed in a recent count, though a more recent estimate is 4,000 individuals (S. Subramanya <em>in litt. </em>2016). The site is however threatened by human encroachment (M. Akhtar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2008), and despite recent increases this site showed population declines in 2016 (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016). The traditional breeding site at Kolleru has become operational again, though there was a decline noted there in 2016 (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016), and with the provision of nesting towers a new breeding site has become established in the Kolleru region (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Sri Lanka, c.5,000 birds were thought to breed, possibly overlapping with the southern Indian populations (S. W. Kotagama <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2001)<strong></strong>. However, recent evidence from Sri Lanka suggests a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 pairs, with counts from the three known colonies totalling just 400 pairs (C. Kaluthota <em>in litt.</em> 2006). In South-East Asia, an estimated 1,083 nests were&#160;at Prek Toal on the Tonle Sap lake in 2014, the highest reported there ever, though 2013 had the lowest number of nest records at 803 (Visal and Mahood 2015). It probably breeds in small numbers on Sumatra, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, but probably no longer in <strong>Myanmar</strong> (G. Chunkino <em>in litt.</em> 2006, Weerakoon and Athukorala 2007). There are recent records of migrants in <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>, but it no longer occurs in the Philippines and China. Numbers recorded in Thailand have increased in recent years (P. Round <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. This is thought to be as a result of improved protection of the nesting colonies in Cambodia. A juvenile, presumably a vagrant, individual has recently been recorded on Amami-Oshima Island, Japan (Hisahiro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).<em> <p></p></em>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>In India, several key breeding colonies are in protected areas and some local communities have pelican conservation initiatives. In Cambodia, the breeding colonies at Prek Toal and Moat Khla/Boeng Chhma are core areas of Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. Conservation actions to reduce chick and egg collection and other forms of disturbance to the breeding colony at Prek Toal have been in place since the late 1990s. Eight out of 15 nesting sites in Tamil Nadu are protected. An awareness programme has been initiated in Sri Lanka as part of a project funded by the Conservation Leadership Programme. This has also set up research stations concerned with improving knowledge of the species (Weerakoon and Athukorala 2007). The provision of nesting towers has led to the founding of a new breeding site in the Kolleru area (H.

The reasons for this decline are largely unknown. Trend calculations are complicated by interannual variation in survey coverage and reporting across its range.&#160;Small populations of other Arctic breeding geese have shown dramatic population fluctuations and this may prove to be the case for this species. The species is precautionarily listed as Vulnerable, however if it is found that recent increases are genuine and not a result of improved monitoring efforts or range shifts the species may warrant further downlisting.<p></p>","It breeds in tundra or scrubby 'wooded' tundra (Madge and Burn 1988,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992)<strong></strong>, in close proximity to rivers and gulleys (Madge and Burn 1988). It favours high and dry areas on steep river banks and precipices, low hills, rock outcrops and rocky islands (Kear 2005). Less commonly it inhabits low islands in lowland areas (Kear 2005). Vegetative cover in its preferred habitats is usually thin and includes dwarf birch&#160;<em>Betula</em>, willow&#160;<em>S</em><em>alix</em>, and dead grass (Kear 2005).&#160;During the non-breeding season it inhabits open steppe and open rolling lowland hills, feeding among steppe, coastal lines, pasture, stubble and crop fields (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Throughout the day it flies to coastal and freshwater lakes to drink (Kear 2005). Occasionally it also roosts at these lakes, using the middle of the water or remote shallow areas and muddy and sandy beaches with low aquatic vegetation (Kear 2005). It will also roost on frozen lakes or on the sea (Kear 2005). The distribution of geese from year to year depends a lot on differences in lake water levels.&#160;On its breeding grounds it feeds primarily on Fabaceae and to a lesser extent grass leaves and the shoots of cotton-grasses&#160;<em>Eriophorum angustifolium</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>E. scheuchzeri</em>&#160;(Rosenfeld and Volkov 2001), as well as some&#160;<em>Carex and Equisetum</em>&#160;spp. (Kear 2005).<em>&#160;</em>Wintering geese feed on winter wheat, barley, maize, pasture and steppe grasses and, in Greece, natural grassland (Kear 2005). In Kazakhstan on passage they feed mainly on spilled grain on the fields after harvesting the wheat crops in autumn. They also feed on arid-adapted herbs such as&#160;<em>Salicornia&#160;</em>(Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. At migration staging areas the diet is thought to consist largely of grass shoots, supplemented with tubers and rhizomes (Kear 2005), as well as the salt marsh’s galophyte complex of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Puccinellia distans</span>&#160;and&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Aeroplus littoralis</span>&#160;(Rozenfeld 2011b, Simeonov and Possardt 2012).<strong>&#160;</strong><br/><br/>The species nests in hollows and fissures in the ground, usually 50-80 mm deep and 200 mm in diameter (Kear 2005).

Successful breeding seasons are also associated with good lemming years, and it has been suggested that this may be because predators are sated by the lemming population and so predation of geese is much lower.<br/><br/>This species is highly migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Following the post-breeding moult it migrates southwards over land in mid- to late-September (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, arriving on its wintering grounds in October-November. Here it is highly gregarious and occurs in flocks, regularly in association with the White-fronted Goose <em>Anser albifrons</em> (Madge and Burn 1988) Lesser White-fronted Goose 				<em>A. erythropus </em>and Greylag Goose<span style=""font-style: italic;""> A. anser</span>. The return journey is made between March and May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>, often together with <em>A. albifrons</em> (Kear 2005). It flies in dense flocks rather than in the defined V-formation typical of other goose species (Kear 2005), and arrives on its breeding grounds in small flocks of 3-15 individuals (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. It begins to breed in June in loose colonies, usually of around five to fifteen pairs (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, S. Rozenfeld<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, although up to 37 have been observed (Kear 2005).&#160;<p></p>","Deliberate hunting of birds occurs in Russia and Kazakhstan (Rozenfeld 2009, 2011b), and results from a recent tagging study suggest mortality owing to hunting could be very high - possibly up to 40% (N. Petkov <em>in litt</em>. 2015, 2016). Following land privatization, and especially the residential and tourist development boom in winter roosting and feeding areas, the quality of roosting areas has decreased. In addition, the low profitability of agriculture has reduced the area under winter wheat cultivation which, together with conversion to other crops, has decreased the availability of food. <a style=""mso-comment-reference:NP_1; mso-comment-date:20120503T1542"">Some key feeding sites have </a>been lost in Bulgaria<strong> </strong>(S. Dereliev <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Hunting pressure on waterfowl as a whole is also substantial in Bulgaria and Romania, including illegal shooting at <a style=""mso-comment-reference:NP_2; mso-comment-date:20120503T1542"">Red-breasted Goose (Simeonov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007, E.

However, conservation activities in the area of Shabla and Durankulak lakes  have reduced deliberate shooting of the species in 2010-2015 (N. Petkov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span>&#160;2012, 2016). Disturbance in the lakes used for roosts is also caused by poachers and fishermen (Dereliev 1997, D. Hulea <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Dereliev and Georgiev, 2002). Disturbance/chasing of feeding birds by hunters (because they associate with White-fronted Geese <em>Anser albifrons</em>, a legal quarry species) is a significant limitation on foraging behaviour and prenuptial accumulation of fat reserves, which has a negative effect on survival during spring migration and breeding (N. Petkov <em>in litt.</em> 2007, 2016). Hunting by tourists in Ukraine poses an increasing threat (WWT TWSG News 10 1997) and birds are shot at staging grounds in Russia.&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 67% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000). The increase in oil and gas operations in the region has seen a significant expansion into previously remote areas and has resulted in disturbance of breeding birds as well as direct habitat loss to a small degree. Further expansion of operations in the region is anticipated (Cranswick <em>et al. </em>2010). Other threats include industrial developments at breeding sites in Gydan and Yamal, the use of fungicides (Mateo <em>et al. </em>2016) and rodenticides in the wintering grounds, as well as displacement by windfarms in the wintering areas. A major recent threat is the expansion in windfarms in the wintering areas since 2008. Many thousands of wind turbines have been proposed in Dobrudhza area both in Bulgaria and Romania, including large complexes adjacent to IBAs and SPAs. Data analysis from wintering grounds in Bulgaria suggest that there is already impact of the constructed windfarms leading to displacement and shifting of the foraging areas (<a>Petkov <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012</a>).<br/><p></p></span></span>","Coordinated censuses in January 2003, 2004 and 2005 resulted in total population estimates of 33,600, 52,800 and 32,100 individuals respectively. The geometric mean of these totals 38,500. Recalculating this including the 2006 count of c.34,000 gives a revised geometric mean of 37,000 individuals. However, total counts of 40,800 in spring 2008 (primarily as a result of a large count in Kalmykia), 44,300 the following winter (Cranswick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and a potential population count of 56,860 in autumn 2010 (Rozenfeld 2011a) lend further weight to the suggestion that counts in the mid 2000s might be partially incomplete because birds wintered away from the traditionally surveyed sites. In 2015, Wetlands International increased its global population estimate from c. 44,000 to c. 56,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species breeds on the Taimyr (70% of the population), Gydan  and Yamal peninsulas, Russia (Hunter and Black 1996). In winter, prior  to the 1950s, much of the population occurred along the western coast of  the Caspian Sea, mainly in Azerbaijan, and in Iran and Iraq. The  wintering area then rapidly shifted to the western Black Sea coast, and  80-90% of birds now congregate in January/ February at 5-10 roost sites  on the Black Sea coast, particularly at Shabla Lakes and Durankulak  Lake, Bulgaria, Razelm-Sinoe lagoons, Romania, and in the coastal area  between the rivers Danube and Dniester in Ukraine (A. Mikityuk&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>1999,&#160;Rusev <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008,&#160;Cranswick&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010). Small numbers also  winter in Azerbaijan. The precise distribution in winter varies  according to the severity of the weather from the Crimean peninsula to  the Dobrudzha region of Bulgaria. In cold weather, small numbers are  occasionally on the Aegean shore of Greece and Turkey (Cranswick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.  </span>2010); during prolonged mild periods, significant numbers may remain in  Kalmykya, Stavropol and Rostov districts in Russia (S. Rozenfeld <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in  litt. </span>2012). Migration is believed to follow a relatively narrow route  south down the Ob to Kazakhstan (though a small number of ringing  recoveries and recent satellite tracking data point to some birds passing to the west of the Urals [Simeonov <em>et al. </em>2014]) and  then east to the Black Sea. There are four known main staging areas: the  Lower Ob, Middle Ob and Kumo-Manych depression in Russia, and the  Northern and Kostanay regions of Kazakhstan. They are also regularly  recorded in small numbers on passage in Hungary (e.g. Pigniczki 2008).  There may be other, currently unknown, staging sites (several new sites have been identified by satellite tracking [Simeonov <em>et al. </em>2014]) and knowledge of  the migration route, particularly in Siberia, should therefore be  considered incomplete. It is also possible that some wintering grounds  remain undetected (perhaps in eastern Ukraine and southwest Russia),&#160;and use of these areas during mild weather may account for the variation in winter survey totals in recent years.<br/><br/>Maximum population counts from wintering or staging areas were 60,000 between 1967-1970, 25,907 between 1976-1990, 75,879 between 1991-1995, 88,000 in 1996  (Aarvak <em>et al.</em> 1996), 60,444 between 1998-2001 (with a maximum of 88,425 in winter 2000) (D. Hulea <em>in litt</em>. 2003) and 56,860 in 2010 (Rozenfeld 2011a)<strong></strong>. It is unclear whether these represent genuine population fluctuations or are due to incomplete surveying of the species following suspected alteration its winter  distribution (as has been seen in the late 1960s following deterioration  of wintering conditions in Azerbaijan) with larger numbers of birds now  short-stopping and over-wintering in Ukraine (Rusev&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2008,&#160;Cranswick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and in areas in Romania (N.

It is thought to be undergoing a continuing decline in the number of subpopulations, and consequently in the area of occupancy.","This species occurs primarily in coastal shrublands and rocky areas, including creviced bluffs, rock outcrops, boulder deposits on river terraces and the risers of major rivers (van Winkel <em>et al</em>. 2018). It occupies a broader range of habitats where introduced mammalian predators are absent (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019). On the only predator-free island where this species occurs, animals use seabird burrows, grassland and woody vegetation including both native and exotic species (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019). Animals commonly live in dead standing trees (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). This species presently holds the global record for the greatest known longevity of geckos in the wild: one toe-clipped female specimen recaptured in 2015 was at least 53 years of age (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019). It reaches maturity at four years of age; generation length is considered to be at least 10 years but could be longer given this species' longevity (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019).","This gecko has been lost from the majority of its historical range following extensive habitat clearance in the 19th Century for agriculture, and is now almost entirely absent from the Canterbury plain (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). Surviving subpopulations in this area are confined to riparian areas that are under constant pressure from development (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). Exotic plantations and firewood collection that removes dead trees are secondary threats in this area (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). In the North Canterbury hills, surviving subpopulations occur in areas attractive for wind farm and other development (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). Christchurch earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 - and subsequent hazard mitigation work in the Port Hills - destroyed areas of suitable habitat and no doubt contributed to population declines (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019). Urban expansion of Christchurch itself and its satellite towns also threatens subpopulations in this area (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). The construction of irrigation channels to support the dairy industry has destroyed some riverside habitats at known localities (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019). As this species is almost entirely confined to the New Zealand mainland, with only a single subpopulation on a pest-free island, it is vulnerable to invasive mammalian predators, as well as to invasive Darwin Ants in at least part of its range (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019). Population recovery has been observed in Hinewai Reserve following predator control, providing direct evidence that these animals suppress numbers of this species elsewhere (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). Animals have been poached for the international pet trade, but not at a level that represents a threat to the viability of remaining subpopulations (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019).","This species' global population contains many thousands of individuals. Declines are ongoing throughout its range and it is likely that it has been lost from many of the more accessible localities where it occurred as recently as 30-50 years ago (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). Anecdotally, it has been lost from much of Birding's Flat on Kaitorete Spit (and is rarer where it survives) over the last 20 years following both clearance of coastal shrubland and invasion of this area by Darwin ants (M. Lettink pers. obs.). The only area of the mainland where it remains very common is Kaitorete Spit, however, densities have declined noticeably over the past 50 years (R. Hitchmough pers. obs.). It is locally quite common in the low hills of North Canterbury, but its distribution is patchy as a result of of historical land conversion (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019). There is no quantitative information available relating to population trends for this species overall, however it is considered to be at risk, and declining (Hitchmough <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). It appears to be stable on Montunau Island, where it is very common (R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019) andf from which mammalian predators are absent (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019), but this island is very small. The available distribution records suggest that the species occurs as a severely fragmented population, and it is absent from large areas of the Canterbury Plains (M. Lettink pers. comm. 2019).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to New Zealand, where it is restricted to the Canterbury region on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island, including Motunau Island (Chapple and Hitchmough 2016). It would historically have ranged throughout the Canterbury Plains and probably the adjacent hills of South Canterbury (from which no records exist, but its past occurrence is suspected due to likely historical habitat and the absence of related species - R. Hitchmough pers. comm. 2019), but now survives on the mainland only on the Banks Peninsula, Kaitortete Spit and the low hills of North Canterbury, and as highly fragmented relict subpopulations on river terraces and along riverbanks (R.

121229971,41688,Ursus arctos,Least Concern,,2017,2016-02-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of the Brown Bear has historically declined in North America, Europe, and Asia, and the species has been extirpated in North Africa. However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the world’s most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 km²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 km²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5‒15 bears per 1,000 km²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, Frković <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130–220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 km² and 2,200 km² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21‒29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of Gärdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (≈1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Sampling to date has demonstrated that salmonids occupy all other streams or stream sections in the Tantangara Creek catchment. Although the historical distribution is not definitively known, scientists working on the species strongly suspect it occurred more widely throughout the Tantangara Creek catchment before salmonid introduction and proliferation.&#160;Based on knowledge of the habitat use and ecology of other upland galaxiid taxa in the&#160;<em>G. olidus</em>&#160;complex,&#160;<em>G.&#160;tantangara</em>&#160;probably previously occupied all of Tantangara Creek down to the junction with the Murrumbidgee River. Historical records of the species were recorded further downstream in Tantangara Creek, below the waterfall, where the species is now not present. The contraction to the species’ present range equates to an estimated loss of extent of occurrence (EOO) of at least 90.5%. The current EOO and area of occupancy (AOO) are both estimated at 4 km<sup>2</sup>. It is projected&#160;that trout are likely to breach this barrier in the next 100 years (either through illegal translocation by anglers, or through drown out of the barrier in extreme storm event). Based on this threat there is a single location. Destruction of instream habitat is occurring via high densities of introduced feral horses, stream widening, stream shallowing; increased sedimentation of instream habitats, destruction of riparian vegetation and increased fire frequency.","This species has been recorded from a small (1.1 m average width and 0.1-0.2 m average depth), cold, clear and fast flowing alpine creek, flowing through an open forest of Eucalypts, low shrubs and tussock grass, which is often snow-covered during winter. Flow consisted predominantly of riffle and glide, with very few pools. A number of small cascades are present within the recorded area. In-stream substrate is predominantly cobble (~40%) with similar amounts of silt, boulder, pebble and gravel making the remainder. Roughly 75% of the stream bank is covered with vegetation, mostly small native shrubs and tussocks. Although uncommon, undercut banks are also present in-stream.","This species is considered to be impacted by alien salmonids, with Brown Trout (<em>Salmo trutta</em>) and Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) found immediately below the falls on this system and galaxiids are absent from this section. A severe decline in distribution and abundance, or likely extinction of the species, is projected if salmonid invasion past the delimiting waterfall occurs. As all age classes of this species are within the predation size range of salmonids, population decline following salmonid invasion is projected to be rapid and severe. The alien Oriental Weatherloach (<em>Misgurnus anguillicaudatus)</em>&#160;is spreading throughout the upper Murrumbidgee catchment, and could be introduced to Tantangara Creek (NSW FSC 2016) via angler use as bait. <em>Galaxias tantangara</em> has a very small distribution, and as such is extremely vulnerable to stochastic effects, with no alternative population or source to allow recolonisation (McDowall 2006). Hydroelectric development is proposed that will potentially transfer another alien fish species (<em>Galaxias brevipinnis</em>) into the Upper Murrumbidgee catchment.<br/><br/>Loss of riparian vegetation, overgrazing and sedimentation as a result of terrestrial pest animals (primarily feral horses) and bushfires represent local-to-catchment-scale threatening processes, which have resulted in general declines in aquatic ecosystem health (NSW FSC 2016). Although there is no direct assessment of the impact of these threats to this species, the extent of damage to instream habitats from feral horses has begun to be quantified with stream habitat at horse crossings significantly altered compared to non-crossing habitat (Allan and Lintermans 2018, unpublished data). The demise of many small streams subject to bushfire impacts during the recent Millenium Drought (van Dijk <em>et al</em>&#160;2013) suggest the risk to this species' habitat is high (NSW FSC 2016). Climate change is likely to alter temperature and stream flow regimes in this species' range. Snow cover in the alpine region due to anthropogenic climate change is expected to decline by 30-93% (depending on model used) by 2050 (Hennessy <em>et al. </em>2003, Nicolls 2005), substantially reducing snowmelt flow volumes during spring. Snowmelt is also likely to occur earlier in the season under climate change scenarios (Hennessy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Green and Pickering 2009). The relationship between these environmental parameters and the persistence or wellbeing of populations of this specie is unknown, but is of concern. The impact is suspected to occur via reduction in streamflow/loss of instream habitat, and water warming, possibly elevating water temperatures over a critical thermal maxima for the species. Climate change is also predicted to result in more extreme weather events, along with an increased risk of fire. Severe storms in burnt catchments often result in extreme sedimentation of streams, with major impacts on small stream habitats (Carey <em>et al.</em> 2003, Lyon and O'Connor 2008). A severe decline in distribution and abundance of this species is projected should an instream sedimentation event occur over the occupied section of the catchment during heavy rainfall following fire (NSW FSC 2016).","There is no quantitative information available relating to current populations trends for this species.&#160;Sampling to date (2002 (Raadik 2014), 2016/17 (H. Allan and M. Lintermans unpublished data)) has demonstrated that salmonids occupy all other streams or stream sections in the Tantangara Creek catchment. The remaining distribution of the species is confined to 3 km of a single stream upstream of a waterfall that excludes salmonid access.&#160;It is inferred from the response of other Galaxiid taxa to invasion by trout, and the current mutually exclusive distribution of trout and Stocky Galaxias, that if trout breach this barrier in the future, a projected severe decline (and likely extirpation) of the species is almost certain.",Stable,"This Australian endemic species is known only from the type locality of Tantangara Creek, upstream of Tantangara Reservoir, New South Wales (Raadik 2014, NSW FSC 2016).

Recent satellite telemetry and stable isotope data support earlier work (Allan 1994) that shows Ludwig’s Bustard to be nomadic and a partial migrant (Shaw 2013, Shaw &amp; Ryan 2015), moving to the western winter-rainfall part of its range in winter.  The breeding season spans from August-December, with the species nesting on bare ground with a clutch of 2-3 eggs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Jenkins and Smallie 2009)<strong></strong>. Chick-rearing is conducted solely by females (Jenkins and Smallie 2009)<strong></strong>. The diet includes invertebrates, some small vertebrates and vegetable matter, including the berries of <em>Lycium oxycladum</em>. There is strong evidence that the species undergoes movement with rains in pursuit of Orthoptera hatchlings, though vegetation remains important (Allan 1994). Flocks of up to 70 individuals have been recorded (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The primary threat to the species is collisions with overhead power lines, with potentially thousands of individuals involved in such collisions each year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Anderson 2002, Jenkins and Smallie 2009, Jenkins 2009, Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011, Shaw 2013)<strong></strong>. Bustards have limited frontal vision so may not see power lines, even if they are marked (Martin and Shaw 2010). Collision rates on high voltage transmission lines in the De Aar area of the Karoo may exceed one Ludwig's Bustard per kilometre per year (Anderson 2002, Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>, and there is evidence for this level of mortality on transmission lines across the Karoo, indicating that the problem is widespread (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011, Shaw 2013)<strong></strong>. Given that the extent of power lines in the Karoo is vast and expanding (Jenkins and Smallie 2009, J. Smallie <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>, with already over 17,000 km in place, it is estimated that such collisions alone are already enough to cause a rapid decline which may intensify in the future (Jenkins <em>et al. </em><em></em>2011). Recent surveys on the more prolific low voltage lines have also revealed substantial levels of mortality (Shaw 2013), and in addition to power lines wind farms are currently establishing in many parts of the Karoo.

A recent repeat of this census (2010-2012) in the South African part of the range estimated the current South African population at 114,000 birds (95% CI 87,000-148,000) (Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2015), and so the total population is inferred to fall within the range of 100,000-499,999 individuals. While there is therefore no clear evidence that the population has declined as projected (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011), there is not enough information with which to understand the trend; Allan’s (1994) estimate was probably a significant underestimate, and the confidence intervals of the current estimate are very wide.

Other populations breed in territorial pairs (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong> between July and December with a peak during the months of August and September coinciding with the peak of the floods<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). The most southerly populations often breed a little earlier in July-August <strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). During the non-breeding season the species is fairly congregatory, occurring regularly in flocks of 10-50 individuals (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>, and there are reports of flocks of up to 1,000 in the Okavango Delta in April-May (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Habitat </strong>In South Africa this species was found to occupy large home ranges of approximately 16 km<sup>2</sup>, which consist largely (75%) of grassland with a small core of essential wetland breeding habitat <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006).<strong> </strong><em>Breeding </em>It nests in shallow sedge-dominated wetlands, often above 2,000 m altitude (<strong></strong>del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>.

It frequents dambos (depressions), permanently isolated wetlands (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006) and vleis<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>) as well as using grasslands, pastures, and occasionally cultivated fields for foraging (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Dams and pans are used as roosting sites during the non-breeding season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Ethiopian population is less dependent on wetlands during this season, generally moving to drier, lower elevation habitats including ploughed fields<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). Birds that breed in the Okavango Delta often move to recently burnt ground in the dry season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Diet </strong>The species feeds on rhizomes, roots and bulbs of sedges (<em>Cyperus</em> and <em>Eleocharis</em> spp. [Bento 2002]), and grass sward and seed (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). It will also take animals including small aquatic snails, fish and frogs<strong> </strong>(Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Chicks are reported to eat insects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>).<strong> Breeding site </strong>Preferred nesting sites are where grass and sedge marshes are bordered by drier, flat to sloping grassland meadows, with medium height vegetation and water up to 1 m in depth (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The nest is a large mound of plant material (reeds and sedges), 1 m in diameter and protruding 20 cm above the water surface, usually with a moat of open water about a metre in diameter around it. A significant proportion of nests in the Okavango Delta are on small mud islands two or three metres in diameter, exposed by 20-30 cm as floodwaters recede, and in these cases, the eggs are laid on few pieces of reed or sedge stems.

R. J. Dean <em>in litt. </em>1999<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span><strong> </strong>Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002, McCann and Benn 2006, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Uys 2012). Other threats include nest disturbance<strong> </strong>(P. Leonard <em>in litt. </em>1999, P. Mundy <em>in litt. </em>1999,<strong> </strong>McCann and Benn 2006); grass-burning regimes (M. Herremans &amp; R. E. Simmons <em>in litt. </em>1999, T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), though in the non-breeding season burnt floodplains are used for feeding in some areas<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003); poisoning; collision with utility lines<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996); direct consumption of chicks; persecution, and traditional medicine<strong> </strong>(A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998). Increasing livestock farming, wars, desertification and agrochemicals are additional threats to the species's habitats<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Nest destruction through trampling by livestock is believed to be a problem<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The population is threatened by the illegal removal of eggs and chicks for international trade<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). Adults are also taken for trade and are hunted<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The level of exports from Tanzania is believed to exceed known legal exports<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The destruction of vegetation by fires probably leaves adults more susceptible to predation and hunting, and flood levels in turn influence the extent and intensity of fires (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Recent potential threats that could extensively affect a large portion of the Okavango Delta include the proposed hydroelectric scheme at Popa Falls in Namibia, papyrus cutting, channel modification, and the extensive aerial spraying of pesticide to eradicate the tsetse fly<strong> </strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The extent of suitable breeding habitat in the Zambezi Delta (Mozambique) and Kafue Flats (Zambia) and the suitability of remaining habitat for feeding is believed to have declined as a result of the interruption of the natural flooding regime by the Cahora Bassa (Tete province), Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe), and Itezhi-tezhi (Zambia) dams upstream, and hunting is also a threat in this country<strong> </strong>(Parker 2005, Bento <em>et al</em>. 2007). Breeding success appears to be low in the species<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b).<strong> </strong>A pre-fledging chick:adult ratio of 5.8% on the Okavango Delta in January 2003 indicates a low chick survival rate<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock 2003). However, each pair of this long-lived species needs to raise only two chicks that survive to adulthood over the course of their lifetimes for the population to remain stable<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The species is highly sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon home ranges which are impacted by adjacent land-use (Morrison and Bothma 1998).   <br/><p></p>","Its present world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals (Pittman 2007) or fewer (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), fewer than 8,000 individuals (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100, placed in the range 9,000-10,000. This increase though may not be a true increase in the population and further research to better understand the movements between the key flood plains in south-central Africa and the seasonal movements whereby cranes come together in large flocks in the drier season needs to be explored further (Morrison in press).

The total population appeared stable from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996), however when estimates from the 1980s are compared with those from 2006, it is judged to have declined significantly<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), perhaps indicating declines in the last 10 years. The key Zambian population at the Kafue Flats reportedly fell in the mid-1990s (Archibald and Meine 1996, Burke 1996) and was estimated at c.1,000 individuals in 2002<strong> </strong>(Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002), but may now be as high as around 2,900 individuals (Shunangu <em>et al. </em>2015). Significant populations elsewhere in Zambia include the Liuwa Plains (1,900 individuals [Viljoen 2015]) and the Bangweulu Swamps (African Parks Foundation pers. comm.<em> </em>to K. Morrison 2016). The Okavango Delta in Botswana also holds a significant population, of between 1,200 and 1,300 birds (Hancock 2008). The comparison of 2002 estimates with those from 1993 suggests marked declines in Mozambique, Zambia and possibly Botswana (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The substantial reduction in numbers since 1993 apparently reflects real declines at individual sites and regions, although the 2002 estimate may be influenced by an improvement in accuracy relative to previous estimates (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007) or fewer<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), not more than 8,000 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals<strong> </strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100 (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). It exists in three disjunct populations, the large south-central population and small Ethiopian and South African populations<strong> </strong>(Jones <em>et al.</em> 2006, Pittman 2007), which may be relicts from its former range<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. Protected areas (including Ramsar Sites) have been established in several key wetlands, notably in Zambia, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996; T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000; T. Fakarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). A major environmental flows initiative is underway for the Zambezi River basin, addressing the restoration of natural flooding patterns, conservation of basin wetlands, and control of invasive species in the Zambezi River basin (Beilfuss and Brown 2010).&#160; Key wetlands targeted by the program include the Kafue Flats, Zambezi Delta, Liuwa Plain, Busanga Swamps, and others, covering about 40% of the global Wattled Crane population. The initiative is a partnership between Zambezi basin dam operators and water authories, NGOs (World Wide Fund for Nature, International Crane Foundation), universities in the basin countries, and other stakeholders. In South Africa, and some other countries, action has included legal protection, marking and relocation of powerlines, awareness programmes, and encouragement of habitat protection, security and management by private landowners (Archibald and Meine 1996, Barnes 2000<strong>,</strong> Burke 1996). In the Kafue Flats, more than 800 ha of invasive <em>Mimosa pigra</em> was eradicated through aerial spraying and community-involvement in manual cutting (Shanungu 2009), although much of this has regrown due to a lack of follow up action (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). A conservation group conducted aerial surveys, field research and a community awareness programme in the Kafue Flats (Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002). Aerial surveys, nest monitoring<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Motsumi and Hancock 2004a, Nkape 2004) and monitoring of adult:juvenile ratios<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b) took place annually on the Okavango Delta in the early 2000s. Surveys and monitoring occur in several countries in south-central Africa (Zambia [International Crane Foundation (ICF) / Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) Partnership, in partnership with the Zambian Department of National Parks and Wildlife; African Parks Foundation], Zimbabwe [BirdLife Zimbabwe], Namibia [Namibia Crane Working Group], South Africa [ICF/EWT Partnership; Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, in partnership with the Endangered Wildlife Trust; KwaZulu-Natal Crane Foundation]), and also aim to drive more awareness amongst local communities (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 1993, an action plan was developed for the species at the African Crane and Wetland Training Workshop (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 1996). A continent-wide programme for the species was launched in 2001 to monitor the species's status and threats, and help develop effective conservation programmes for the management of wetland systems<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). National conservation plans have been developed for Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Following a workshop in July 2000, the Wattled Crane Recovery Programme was initiated for the South African population<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Pittman 2007). There are currently five partners in this South African programme, one aim of which is to establish a viable captive population and supplement the wild population (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2012). The Johannesburg Zoo has also built a dedicated chick-rearing facility, and several captive management facilities throughout South Africa now participate in the breeding programme<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). In 2005, it was announced that a veterinary fence would be constructed to the east of the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park in Botswana, effectively extending the park boundary and protecting grasslands used by the species from the high density of livestock in the area<strong> </strong>(BirdLife Botswana 2006).

Improve protection of birds outside of protected areas such as the Jao/Boro rivers of Botswana<strong> </strong>(Gibson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Increase educational campaigns (A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998), targeting landowners with breeding cranes,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>as well policy makers (Burke 1996, T. Fokarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). Employ satellite tracking to study the species's movements across its range (BirdLife Botswana Crane Working Group 2004, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). In South Africa, work with farming communities to conserve natural grasslands that surround wetlands<strong> (</strong>McCann and Benn 2006).

It shows high resilience to heavy deforestation and degradation in some areas (F. Dowsett-Lemaire<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012), although such changes are assumed to cause local declines in population density. The use of exotic invasive trees (especially <em>Eucalyptus</em> and <em>Pinus</em> spp.) for nesting permits persistence in degraded and mosaic landscapes (McPherson <em>et al. </em>2016a). In South Africa there may have been a 14% decline in range over the past c.25 years, using data from the Southern African Bird Atlas Projects (Cooper 2015). It shows dietary plasticity and can feed on a diversity of prey (although maybe almost entirely mammals [Swatridge <em>et al. </em>2014]) according to habitat type, which may allow it to persist in certain areas; and mesopredator release in some modified habitats may provide extra prey for this species allowing it to occur at higher densities than expected (see Swartridge <em>et al. </em>2014, Symes and Antonites 2014, McPherson <em>et al. </em>2016b, C. Symes <em>in litt. </em>2016).","Although the species is welcomed by foresters in some areas, it is subjected to a number of significant threats throughout much of its range, including deforestation (carried out for timber extraction, charcoal production, the encroachment of agriculture and plantations, shifting cultivation and mining), collisions with anthropogenic structures (wires, fences, vehicles, glass buildings, wind turbines) and electrocution on utility networks (S. McPherson <em>in litt. </em>2016, B. Reeves <em>in litt. </em>2016), competition from humans for prey species (with apparently unsustainable levels of exploitation for bushmeat in some areas), direct persecution in an estimated 90% of its range (e.g. for food, arrow-fletching, witchcraft, ornaments and its pest status and threat to humans) and human disturbance (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005, Thomsett 2011, McPherson 2015). Conflict with humans can arise because this species will take small amounts of livestock and pets (McPherson <em>et al. </em>2016b). In Ghana, it is threatened by deforestation and hunting, including of its main prey (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Some once-occupied areas in Ghana have now been almost totally deforested, whilst others, such as Bosomoa Forest Reserve, have been converted to teak plantations (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The species may have altered its diet to partly accommodate declines in primate abundance in parts of Ghana, but its population is unlikely not to have been affected by such a dramatic decline in its prey base (which has probably worsened further since the mid-1990s) (B. Phalan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).  Although the species appears to be doing well at Udzungwa, Tanzania, it  may be absent as a breeding species from several areas (e.g. Uzungwa  scarp, Kising’a-Rugaro, New Dabaga), owing to prey depletion by humans  (T. Jones <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). In Nigeria, it seems likely that the population has been impacted by widespread forest clearance in the south of the country (P. Hall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). In South Africa, wind turbines are becoming more of a threat to this species, with several reported casualties (B. Reeves <em>in litt.</em> 2016).","Ferguson-Lees and Christie (2001) estimate that total the population could number in the upper thousands, although given its range this is perhaps likely to be an underestimate and they also state that, for this reason, an estimate of tens of thousands might be expected. On this basis, the population is estimated at 5,000-50,000 mature individuals until better information becomes available.",Decreasing,"<em>Stephanoaetus coronatus</em> is a widespread resident of sub-Saharan Africa, occurring in easternmost <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sudan</span> and<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> South Sudan</span>, western <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ethiopia</span>, southernmost <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Senegal</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Guinea</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Liberia</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">C</span>ô<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">te d'Ivoire</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ghana</span> and southern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Togo</span>, southern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nigeria</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cameroon</span>, through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Gabon</span>, into <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Congo</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Democratic Republic of Congo</span>, south to north-western <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Angola</span>, east to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uganda</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Kenya</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tanzania</span>, south-east through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Zambia</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Malawi</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mozambique</span>, to northern and eastern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Zimbabwe</span>, north-eastern, eastern and south-eastern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">South Africa</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Swaziland</span> (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).

All drainages currently inhabited by <em>I. pricei</em> now harbour non-native Blue (<em>I. furcatus</em>) and Channel (<em>I. punctatus</em>) Catfishes, the non-native Black Bullhead (<em>Ameiurus melas</em>) is now known from the Yaqui Basin, and the Flathead Catfish (<em>Pylodictis olivaris</em>) has been recorded anecdotally in the Yaqui Basin (Varela-Romero <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Extirpation in most of its range in the United States resulted from ground water pumping that decreased spring flow, causing San Bernardino Creek to dry up; trampling by livestock made remaining habitat unsuitable.

The species is apparently extirpated in the Rio Sonora basin and in the Rio Casas Grandes, an endorheic interior drainage in Chihuahua, Mexico (Miller 2005, Varela-Romero <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent range-wide surveys indicated that <em>Ictalurus pricei</em> is now restricted to the Yaqui, Mayo and Fuerte river basins, though the species is possibly extirpated in the Mayo drainage (Varela-Romero<em> et al. </em>2011). There is mounting evidence that populations of native <em>Ictalurus</em> spp. south of the Fuerte River represent a distinct, undescribed species (Miller 2005, Varela-Romero <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Castaneda-Rivera <em>et al.</em> 2014, Ballesteros-Cordova<em> et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Three small, wild populations (introduced from hatchery stock) exist in the United States: Twin Pond (San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge) and House Pond (Slaughter Ranch), both in the Yaqui River Basin, and Big Tank (El Coronado Ranch) in the Sulphur Springs Valley drainage, all in Cochise County, Arizona (Baker <em>et al.</em> 2008, Varela-Romero <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Reasons for this recent decline are unclear, though the species has suffered from previous loss, fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat, and changes to fire regime in the breeding habitat. Likely causes of the recent decline are an outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease in 2014 and the effects of a ten-year drought on productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat that reduced the breeding condition of females. It is also likely that the lack of habitat burns in the preferred breeding habitat has reduced the availability and quality of preferred food plants. The species is therefore classified as Critically Endangered.<p></p>","The Orange-bellied Parrot breeds in a mosaic of eucalypt forest and rainforest bordering extensive moorland plains. Nesting occurs in tree hollows and the species feeds on the seeds of a range of grasses and sedges in moorlands. There is some evidence that early in the breeding season birds prefer to forage in areas burnt seven to 15 years earlier, whilst later in the breeding season they prefer areas burnt three to five years earlier (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011). After breeding, Orange-bellied Parrots migrate to saltmarshes, dunes, beaches, pastures and shrublands close to the coast (&lt;5 km), where there they feed on the ground or in low vegetation, almost exclusively on seeds, mainly of salt-tolerant coastal and saltmarsh plants (Loyn<em> et al</em>. 1986, Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).<br/><p></p>","The primary reason for the species's rarity is thought to be its specialist habitat requirements, and fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat by grazing, agriculture and urban and industrial development. Changes have also occurred in the breeding habitat, where there has been reduction of fire, which would normally produce favourable habitat structure for the species. Up until the 1990s, fire was regularly used by small-scale tin miners to reduce vegetation cover to aid mining and protect assets, coincidentally producing high quality foraging habitat for the species. Management of the area is now subject to stricter use of fire by the land manager and due to a combination of lack of resources and risk aversion, habitat management burns have rarely been implemented. This has resulted in a gradual decline in the habitat quality for the species. Disease is an important threat to the tiny population. An outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in 2015 infected 19 out of 26 wild Orange-bellied Parrot nestlings tested (Anon. 2015). One adult also tested positive for the disease. This contributed to a decline in the wild population from 35 to 23 mature individuals in 2016. Competition with introduced seed-eating finches may have affected winter food availability, while some former breeding habitat may have been vacated because of a change in the fire regime and competition with introduced Common Starlings <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, which fill nest-hollows with nesting material, rendering them unsuitable. The introduced Sugar Glider <em>Petaurus breviceps</em> is also implicated as a predator of incubating females, eggs and nestlings during the Birch's Inlet release and is a known threat to other species including the Swift Parrot (Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2014). Sugar Gliders are absent from Melaleuca and therefore may have had an influence on the contraction of the breeding range. Deaths from random events, such as predation by foxes and cats, or disease, are significant threats to such a tiny population. Ongoing degradation of remaining saltmarsh habitat on the mainland is a significant threat (C. Tzaros and M.A. Weston <em>in litt. </em>2003). A ten-year drought reduced productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat, reducing the breeding condition of females.&#160;Windfarm developments may kill about one bird per year (Smales <em>et al. </em>2005). Due to the low population size, the species is highly susceptible to genetic Allee effects, which might lead to further population reductions (Crates <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><p></p>","Surveys in early 2010 found fewer than 50 birds at Melaleuca and found no birds at any other historical breeding areas. The wild population was therefore estimated to contain fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals in 2010.&#160;The total wild population at the end of the 2015/16 season was only 35 (M. Holdsworth <em>in litt. </em>2016) and has decreased to 14 in 2017. The sex ratio is highly skewed (12 males and 2 females) (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt.</em> 2017). Captive breeding programmes have been carried out since 1986 to restock the wild population, with more than 300 individuals in different breeding centres in Australia and Tasmania (BirdLife Australia <em>in litt</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"This species breeds only in south-western Tasmania, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>. The current known breeding population is only found at one small site, at Melaleuca, but the historical distribution was more extensive and unsuccessful attempts were made to re-establish&#160;a population at Birch’s Inlet.&#160;Birds migrate to the mainland after breeding, sometimes stopping over on King Island, and overwintering at coastal sites in south-eastern South Australia and Victoria. Annual winter counts in Victoria, South Australia and Bass Strait from 1979 to 1990 varied between 67 and 122, with no significant change in numbers (Starks <em>et al.</em> 1992). Numbers recorded in mainland surveys have since declined, for example 48 birds recorded from 19 sites in 2007 (Saunders 2008). The overall population, which was estimated to number around 150 individuals in 2005 (M. Holdsworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2005), has since undergone a rapid decline (confirmed by data from both breeding and wintering sites): surveys in early 2010 found fewer than 50 birds at Melaleuca and no birds at any other historical breeding areas (Sims 2010). The wild population was therefore estimated to contain fewer than 50 individuals in 2010, and extinction in the wild has been predicted to take place within 3-5 years (Sims 2010). More recently, the total post-breeding wild population at Melaleuca was only 35, including 18 juveniles (M. Holdsworth <em>in litt. </em>2016). Based on mean annual survival estimates (Holdsworth <em>et al.</em> 2011) the return of mature individuals in 2016/17 was predicted to be 20-25. Low breeding participation of females appears to be a limiting factor in some years, with some females not breeding every year (Sims 2010).&#160;Only 12 and 13 young are known to have fledged at Melaleuca in 2008/09 and 2009/10 respectively, and urgent action was taken in 2010/11 to secure the captive population by the collection of 21 of 27 young as founders in that year (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011). In recent years the output of fledglings has recovered somewhat with an average of 25/year (14-39/year). The captive insurance population has expanded in recent years and by April 2016 consisted of about 325 individuals held at ten facilities under a cooperative breeding programme and is considered to be secure (A. Everaardt <em>in litt. 2</em>016). Re-establishment of the Orange-bellied Parrot at Birch's Inlet was attempted during the period 1999-2009 with a total of 410 captive-bred birds being released, which produced 71 wild-bred fledglings. However, the reintroduction attempt failed because mean annual adult survival of released birds was 0.30 - half that of wild birds (0.65) - and the low fertility rate of 0.55 mimics the low fertility of the captive population (0.57), which is significantly less than in wild birds (0.86). Breeding output at this site was further limited by nest competition and depredation.&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. A recovery team was established in 1980, a wide range of research projects are ongoing, and awareness-raising and education programmes are conducted. Much feeding habitat in Tasmania (including King Island), Victoria and South Australia has been reserved or is managed. Breeding, migration and winter counts are made annually, and almost 100% of the wild population is colour-banded. A captive breeding programme has been established and the population of about 350 birds is held at 10 institutions under a cooperative captive breeding effort. The captive population is predominantly derived from six founders collected in the 1980s (perhaps leading to low egg fertility as a result of inbreeding depression) but more recently has been bolstered by the inclusion of 21 new founders collected in 2010. Captive-bred birds that have been released have apparently migrated successfully between their breeding and wintering grounds (Loyn <em>et al. </em>2005, Anon. 2014), but few birds released on the breeding grounds return in the following breeding season (Troy and Gales&#160;2016), suggesting that most released birds fail to migrate or survive to the following year. As the population is severely male biased (six males per one female), a higher proportion of females is released in spring to correct the sex ratio  imbalance (Stojanovic et al. 2017). The survival rate and reproductive success of captive-reared birds are far lower&#160;than for wild birds (Holdsworth 2006, Holdsworth <em>et al.</em> 2011, Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2017). Moreover, the plumage of captive-bred birds is in poorer condition, which might prove to be energetically costly, especially during migration (Stojanovic<em> et al</em>. 2017). Of &#160;53 captive birds released in 2014 and 2015, just six survived to return to Melaleuca. An additional 27 captive bred individuals were released at Melaleuca in 2015.

The rate of the decline is difficult to asses but assumed to be at least 25% over three generations (10.5 years). Therefore, the species is precautionarily listed as Near  Threatened, but might warrant a further category change if new information on population trends becomes available.","Throughout its breeding range, the species occupies boreal spruce and fir forests. Being a long-distance migrant, it leaves the breeding sites in northern North America in August and arrives to the wintering grounds in northern South America by September/October (DeLuca <em>et al</em>. 2013). There, it occurs east of the Andes (below 3,000 m) in a variety of habitats,  including lowland forest, cloudforest, secondary growth, forest edges and plantations (Curson 2018). By April, the species migrates back to the breeding range, where it arrives mid-May/June (DeLuca<em> et al. </em>2013). Insects are the predominant food source, supplemented with fruits during migration (Curson 2018).","<p>Given its wide range of habitat use in the non-breeding range, forest  loss and degradation there is not thought to be a key threat (DeLuca <em>et al. </em>2013).  The remote nature of its breeding range would also appear to make  logging there unlikely to be a significant threat too (DeLuca <em>et al. </em>2013).  The species is frequently reported as suffering mortality by colliding  with large structures during migration, but this in part could be a  result of the species’s abundance, and so the impacts of this on its  overall population dynamics may in fact be trivial (DeLuca <em>et al. </em>2013).</p> <p>The species’s breeding range is likely being affected  by climate change. The area of the breeding range is predicted to expand by 2080 following a shift poleward (Ralston and Kirchman 2013). Yet, this shift potentially brings other  species into competition with the Blackpoll Warbler, and turn  lower-elevational areas into population sinks (DeLuca <em>et al. </em>2013).

The species breeds from May onwards, nesting later further to the north depending on the timing of the thaw (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It usually nests solitarily on smaller waters but may nest in loosely colonial groups on larger waters (e.g. several pairs nesting a few metres apart on the same lake) (Snow and Perrins 1998). On migration, large flocks of 200-1,200 individuals may form, with similar concentrations occurring on rich marine fishing grounds during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).

It generally avoids waters with dense floating or emergent vegetation and steep rocks above the water, and if feeding conditions are inadequate in the pool chosen for breeding the species may fly to the coast or to lakes with higher abundances of fish in order to feed (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season, the species frequents inshore waters along sheltered coasts, occasionally occurring inland on lakes, pools, reservoirs and rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, frogs, fish spawn, aquatic insects, annelid worms and plant matter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a small depression or a mound of plant matter, built in shallow water up to 10 m from the shore or very near the water's edge, on islets or small promontories (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998).

It shows a preference for freshwater habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with low banks<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), small islets<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys<strong><sup> </sup></strong>or among mossy bogs<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover<strong></strong> (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). It generally avoids areas with steep slopes or wetlands enclosed by forest<strong></strong> (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) the majority moult and overwinter at sea<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) on shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) (optimally 5-15 m) (Scott and Rose 1996) with abundant benthic fauna<strong></strong> (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. barnacles and shrimps)<strong></strong> (Johnsgard 1978), worms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), echinoderms, isopods, amphidods<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) and insects<strong></strong> (e.g. midges and caddisflies <strong></strong>[del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992])<strong></strong> as well as small fish<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and fish eggs<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as seeds, roots and tubers<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) close to water<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) or placed further away in dwarf heath<strong></strong> (Kear 2005).  <p></p>","<p>Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten this species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while development associated with oil drilling sites can cause additional, low-level impacts through human disturbance and the degradation of food resources (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). Some large populations border oil fields and proximity to drilling and transport puts the population at high risk of oil pollution (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, one study found that although the 1996 Sea Empress oil spill in Carmarthen Bay resulted in a rapid and drastic reduction in Common Scoter numbers in the area, complete recovery occurred after three winters with no observable long-term effects (Banks <em>et al</em>. 2008).  </p><p>Climate change is thought to negatively impact the species at present and in the future through habitat loss and ecosystem degradation. Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for this species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in Siberia (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher <em>et al</em>. 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Eutrophication in the Baltic Sea resulting from agricultural run-off, could also cause the loss of key prey items, e.g. bivalves (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>  The risk of bycatch is thought to affect a majority of the population, as reported in the Gulf of Gdańsk (Stempniewicz 1994), and the commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat, through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Further threats to food resources include the loss of benthic habitats caused by sand and gravel extraction, although Skov <em>et al.</em> (2011) suggest that in the present-day Baltic region, this is occurring at insufficient levels to be responsible for declines in waterbirds. Hunting is contributing to mortality in some parts of the species’ range, but not thought to drive significant population decline. In Denmark, c.2,800-5,200 Common Scoters are harvested per year (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006) but no data is available for other countries, although hunting of Common Scoters is legal in some EU countries (HELCOM 2013b). Interaction with wind farms could pose a potential threat to the species. While Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2007) showed that duck densities were more adversely affected by wind farms than other groups of species, Dürr (2013) found the opposite, stating that collision rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared to other species groups. Avian influenza is present in the population, but as yet there is no evidence that it has caused significant mortality events (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gudmundsson <em>et al.</em> 2010). High-speed ferries have been suggested as a major cause of Common Scoter disturbance by a study in the Kattegat Sea, Denmark (Larsen and Laubek 2005).<p></p>  <p></p>","The total population has been estimated to number 1,600,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), which probably includes c.1,070,000 mature individuals, assuming that they account for around 2/3 of the population.&#160;The European population is estimated at 107,000-131,000 pairs, which equates to 214,000-263,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species breeds in <strong>Iceland</strong>, eastern Greenland (<strong>Denmark</strong>) and northern <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, across Scandinavia and northern parts of western and central <strong>Russia</strong> (e.g. Collinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).

Radar surveys show that the species is declining rapidly on at least one of the other islands where it breeds (Kaua'i), and declines are probable on other islands too. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","On Maui, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, nesting takes place mainly between 2,000 and 3,000 m, in lava cavities with little vegetation nearby (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Elsewhere, for example West Maui (J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007) and Kaua'i (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007), it nests at lower elevations, amongst dense shrubs and ferns or in native grasslands with bracken (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998, P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2007). On Haleakalā, Maui, birds nest in rock crevices and tunnels that are over 0.5 m deep, often exceeding two metres (Simons and Hodges 1998, J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Pairs nest in cavities in the volcanic terrain, in burrows beneath rocks or at the base of clay cliffs (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007). At lower altitudes, they excavate burrows or nest in cavities often at the base of trees (Simons and Hodges 1998, P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007), although many burrows on Lana'i are not at the base of trees (J. Penniman<em> in litt.</em> 2007). On Lana'i, birds breed in dense uluhe fern habitat (<em>Dicranopteris linearis</em> and <em>Diplopterygium pinnatum</em>) and start breeding in March, whereas in Haleakalā, Maui, birds begin breeding in mid-February (Penniman <em>et al</em>. 2008). On Kaua'i, birds breed in montane wet forests, where burrows are located along ridgelines in predominantly native forest, often at the base of large trees. On average, birds take five to six years to reach maturity but begin visiting colonies to establish pair bonds and prospect nesting sites at 2-3 years (Hess and Banko 2006). Most eggs are laid in May and June, with most young fledging by December (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005). Birds nesting at higher elevations appear to finish provisioning chicks earlier, with most birds having departed the colony at Haleakalā by the end of October. The diet comprises mostly fish and squid, with squid constituting c.50-75% of the food ingested (Simons and Hodges 1998). It has been found that at least some birds nesting on Lana'i feed in waters around the Aleutian Islands, as shown through the use of tracking devices on several breeding individuals (P. Baicich&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2007).<em> P. sandwichensis</em> regularly is observed foraging in mixed species flocks in association with predatory fish species (Mitchell <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;<p></p>","<p>Historically the species suffered declines through harvesting by early Polynesians and during the period of Hawaiian settlement beginning c.1,800 years ago (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species may have been restricted to its current breeding range since the arrival of Europeans (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most serious current threat is predation by introduced vertebrates including Indian mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus,&#160;</em>feral cats, Common Barn-owls <em>Tyto</em> <em>alba</em>, rats, dogs, and pigs. Although not yet established on Kaua'i and Lana'i islands, mongooses represent an ongoing major threat to nestling and adult birds at breeding colonies on the other islands within the Hawaiian Petrel’s range. Feral cat and rat depredation, where unmanaged on other islands, continues to limit recovery capacity. Considerable efforts are ongoing to reduce the impact of cat predation on the species with cat-proof fences erected on Maui and Mauna Loa. Adults and nestlings are very susceptible to predation, as nests are on the ground, and they are naïve to predators.</p>  <p>A significantly lower percentage of birds come ashore to nest during El Niño years (c.40% compared to c.65% normally) (C.N. Hodges <em>per</em> Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003), suggesting that the species is sensitive to such disturbances in environmental conditions (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>  <p>Each autumn during the fledging season, some of the fledgling birds become grounded as a result of light attraction and disorientation. Occassionally, birds collide with sources of light, and mortality sometimes occurs as a result of collisions with fences and power-lines mostly on Kaua'i and Maui (Simons 1985, Cooper and Day 1998, Simons and Hodges 1998). Once on the ground, fledglings are unable to fly and are killed by cars, cats and dogs, die from environmental exposure or injuries, or are recovered by the public. The siting of the Kaheawa wind farm on Lana'i also appears to be causing ongoing mortality at a potentially significant rate.</p>  Some areas of nesting habitat have been lost to the pressures of modern urbanisation and degraded by feral goats and pigs and weeds. Nest burrows are trampled by feral goats, mouflon sheep and Chital Deer&#160;<em>Axis axis&#160;</em>(Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, H. T. Harvey and Associates 2015) however, these are now excluded from the largest colony and deer&#160;are not present at the majority of sites. On Lana'i, habitat degradation caused by the invasive tree, Strawberry Guava <em>Psidium</em> <em>cattleianum</em>, is considered to be the biggest threat to the long term survival of the colony (J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In the past, considerable amounts of the Hawaiian Petrel’s habitat were converted for livestock, however as the majority of colonies are now protected, this represents a much reduced threat.<p></p>","Spear <em>et al.</em> (1995) give a best estimate of 3,750-4,500 breeding pairs based on at-sea surveys. This roughly equates to 7,500-9,000 mature individuals, and 11,250-13,500 individuals in total. The discovery of possibly several thousand birds breeding on Lana'i during terrestrial surveys in 2006-2007 and two small colonies on West Maui (J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007), probably in the tens or low hundreds of birds (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007), may bring the estimated breeding population close to the upper estimate of 6,500-8,300 pairs calculated by Spear <em>et al.</em> (1995). However,&#160;the rapid decline in at least the population on Kaua'i would suggest that the population size may now in fact be smaller than this. Given uncertainty regarding overall trends, the upper and lower bounds from Spear <em>et al.</em> (1995) are used here, i.e. 3,750-8,300 pairs, or 7,500-16,600 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<p></p><em>Pterodroma sandwichensis </em>ranges in the central Pacific and breeds on the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>). There are approximately 2,547 known burrows within Haleakalā National Park (Haleakalā National Park 2015 <em>unpubl. data</em>). Two small colonies are present in the West Maui Mountains, but they are so far unquantified (Cooper and Day 2003, J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007), with numbers perhaps in the tens or low hundreds (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007). On Hawai'i, small numbers breed on Mauna Kea and 40-50 pairs were present on Mauna Loa prior to 1995 (Ainley <em>et al</em>. 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998). On Kaua'i, 1,600 pairs are indicated by observations of birds at a rafting site (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997). On Moloka'i, 5-10 birds were heard calling in 1980, suggesting small numbers (Simons and Hodges 1998), but there has not been a concerted effort to estimate numbers on this island (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Surveys in 2006-2007 located a colony in the cloud forests of Lana'ihale on the north side of Lana'i (P. Baicich <em>in litt</em>. 2007, A. Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2007). This population probably numbers several thousand birds, based on the volume of calling during night time listening surveys in April and May along the Lana'ihale ridge at the highest point in the uplands, although only 14 burrows had been found by October 2007 (J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007). Surveys have so far been hampered by weather conditions and the risk of habitat disturbance (J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I. On Maui, there is a long-term monitoring programme in the Haleakala National Park (Simons and Hodges 1998)<strong></strong> and efforts are made to control introduced mammals. In 1976, a perimeter fence was put up around the main colony to exclude feral goats and pigs from the habitat (Carlile <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. The predator exclosures placed around the national park may have facilitated an increase in the number of birds in eastern Maui (Cooper and Day 2003)<strong></strong>. The trapping of rats started in 1968, and since 1997 rodenticides have been used (Carlile <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>.

Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In 2006, a fence was completed to encircle a large portion of the breeding habitat on Lana'i; the purpose was to exclude ungulates that damage the vegetation thus impacting the island's water supply (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Simultaneously, a limited cat-trapping programme has been initiated in the fenced area (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. On Maui, Lana'i, and Kaua'i, grounded fledglings are collected and released, although the benefit of doing this has yet to be confirmed as very few banded individuals have subsequently been encountered (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Fencing erected for forest conservation has been modified to reduce collisions (Simons and Hodges 1998)<strong></strong>. On Kaua'i, auditory surveys to detect colonies are ongoing, and have included documenting the first known nesting sites on Kaua'i in the Upper Limahuli Preserve (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Also on Kaua'i, street lighting is shielded in critical areas and lighting on some buildings has been modified to reduce collisions (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998)<strong></strong>. A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006, under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, has enforced a campaign running since 2005, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua'i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. The island's electricity company is helping by darkening all of its 3,000 street lights, and shielding or turning some of them off. The company has also fitted large balls to power lines in an effort to reduce the number of birds that collide with the cables (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. Significant improvements have beem made in reducing light attraction and collision, although there is still a considerable amount of new and existing infrastructure that requires modification (N.

The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong>. It breeds in the high Arctic from late-May or early-June (depending on the timing of the Arctic thaw) <strong></strong> in single pairs or loose groups<strong></strong>, often with colonies of nesting gulls or terns (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005);<strong></strong> although it is not itself a colonial species (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. Males undergo short post-breeding moult migrations<strong></strong>, often gathering in small or large flocks (up to 4,000 in Iceland) (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> while females are incubating (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Females usually moult in the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, although large concentrations (500-1,000 individuals) of moulting females have been recorded away from breeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. During the moulting period the species is flightless for a period of c.3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The autumn migration begins after the moulting period in mid-August (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, with males tending to remain much further north than females or immatures (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong> leading to some sexual segregation during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. The species is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season<strong></strong> and is commonly observed in small or large flocks<strong></strong> sometimes of several thousand individuals (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The return spring migration generally begins in late-February (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> although flocks of non-breeders may remain in the south, often in winter quarters, during the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in tundra, wooded tundra<strong></strong> and moorland regions in the high Arctic<strong></strong>, occupying small, shallow<strong></strong>, freshwater lakes, pools and rivers<strong></strong> with grassy shorelines and high densities of invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It shows a preference for water less than 6 m deep (usually 2 m) for diving (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters on shallow coastal waters&#160; less than 10 m deep<strong></strong> (especially in the vicinity of sewage outlets)<strong></strong>, as well as sheltered bays<strong></strong>, estuaries <strong></strong> and brackish coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It is also found inland on large lakes <strong></strong> and reservoirs during this season (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species is omnivorous (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. During the winter, its diet consisting predominantly of molluscs (Johnsgard 1978) such as muscles, cockles and clams while in coastal habitats and <em>Hydrobia </em>snails while in brackish waters (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005). Other food sources include insects<strong></strong>, aquatic insect larvae<strong></strong>, crustaceans such as amphipods, worms, small fish<em></em><strong></strong>, and the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants such as sedges <em></em>and water weeds (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Breeding</strong> The nest is a shallow depression close to water<strong></strong> on the ground<strong></strong>, either in thick vegetation<strong></strong>, in cracks in rocks, under woody shrubs or under perennial herbaceous vegetation less than 50 cm high (Iceland) (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005). The species is not colonial but it will sometimes nest among gulls and terns (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, with neighbouring nests being placed as close as 1 m in some areas (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>In Scotland, UK the introduction of a sewage treatment scheme in the Firth of Forth, a large marine bay, resulted in a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species, with feeding flocks only remaining at outfalls where sewage continued to be discharged in large quantities (Campbell 1984)<strong></strong>. It was unclear whether the changes in the species's distribution were due to reductions in the number of food items borne in the sewage or to reductions in aquatic invertebrate abundance as a result of the new treatment system (Campbell 1984)<strong></strong>.   <p></p>","<p>Incidental capture in commercial fisheries poses a major threat to this species which shows a relatively high vulnerability to bycatch (Sonntag <em>et al.</em> 2012). Entanglement in fishing equipment causes an estimated 5-10% annual mortality in the Baltic region (Jensen 2009). The species winters near major fishing areas in Europe, North America and Japan, thus interaction with fisheries is common throughout the range.  </p><p>Wetland habitats critical to breeding success are potentially threatened by climate change. Remotely sensed imaging has revealed landscape-level changes, including the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska, associated with a warming climate, longer growing seasons and increased potential evapotranspiration (Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006). Audubon’s (2014) climate model predicts the loss of over half of the North American summer range with suitable climatic conditions, with similar trends likely in Eurasia. Climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes throughout the sensitive ecosystems in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reduced duration of spring snow cover in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Greater Scaup, possibly due to trophic mismatch, with a projected 12.9% decline in population by 2080, compared to the 1980 census (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Future ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Scaup diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Certain colonies in the Pacific Northwest may be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium originating from mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, raising the possibility that heavy metal pollution could be contributory to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). The Scaup’s habit of congregating around coastal sewage outlets in winter, also exposes it to risk from other pollutants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017).</p>  <p>Flocks often occur in vicinity of oil-related developments and are therefore susceptible to oiling and related pollutants, particularly when moulting and during winter. Oil pollution could also impact the species indirectly through decreased abundance or quality of invertebrate prey (Kirby <em>et al.</em> 1993, Kear 2005). Oil and gas exploration in Siberia may have disruptive impacts on breeding grounds and could potentially be associated with an increase in hunting pressures (Jensen 2009, Mineyev 1998). Wind farms may represent a threat to the Greater Scaup, having been shown to affect duck population densities more severely than those of other species groups (Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2007). However, it has been found that collision rates are lower than for other groups (Dürr 2013 <em>per</em> Fox <em>et al. </em>2015) and, as such, wind farms are likely to only be damaging to the population when inappropriately placed (Drewitt &amp; Langston 2006).<br/></p>  At present, direct persecution only appears to have a low impact on a minority of the population, with annual mortality in the EU estimated at 0.6% (Mooji 2005) or not more than 2% (Jensen 2009). In the last 10-year period with available data (2004-2014), the estimated harvest of Greater Scaup in US and Canada ranged from 56,000 to 104,000 birds and showed a decreasing trend in population size (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). Another study in North America found little evidence that harvest was  associated with population decline (Afton and Anderson 2001). Low levels of hunting have also been reported in north-western Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). Although wintering in densely populated coastal areas (Europe, N. America, Japan) makes the species an exposed hunting target, persecution is thought to have negligible effects on the population as a whole.<p></p>  <p></p>","The global population is estimated to number c. 4,920,000-5,130,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).&#160;The breeding population in Europe is estimated at 134,000-178,000 pairs, which equates to 269,000-355,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"Summer breeding grounds of the species range across the northern limits of Europe (including <strong>Iceland</strong>) and Asia, through the Aleutian Islands (year-round breeding) to Alaska (<strong>USA</strong>), and across to the Atlantic coast of <strong>Canada </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).

It breeds from late-May onward<strong></strong> in single pairs or loose groups (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, the males leaving the females soon after the start of incubation <strong></strong> (between late-June and early-September) to gather in small flocks for a flightless moulting period (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. Some populations undergo extensive moult migrations of up to 1,000 km, while others moult on waters near the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Females moult between early-August and early-October on the breeding grounds (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, often abandoning their young at the start of the moult which then gather into large parentless groups (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. The southward autumn migration occurs from September to October after the post-breeding moult (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> and non-breeders may oversummer in the wintering areas (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Outside of the breeding season the species is highly gregarious<strong></strong>, in winter gathering into large aggregations of perhaps several tens of thousands of individuals to roost or to feed in inshore and offshore waters (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. The species is diurnal and regularly dives to depths of 3-10 m when foraging, with a maximum dive depth of 50-60 m (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on marshy grass tundra in the high Arctic<strong></strong>, especially where habitat mosaics are formed by hummocks and ridges together with moist depressions<strong></strong>, freshwater lakes<strong></strong>, bogs<strong></strong>, slow rivers<strong></strong> or pools of standing water, it is common among willows or dwarf birch in the arctic-alpine zone (Scandinavia) (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. It generally avoids wooded tundra (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species also breeds on small rocky islands off mainland Arctic coasts and on larger offshore islands,  using promontories, deltas<strong></strong>, coastal inlets<strong></strong> and islets in fjords (Greenland) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998<em></em>)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>The species winters at sea, generally far offshore<strong></strong> in waters 10-35 m deep<strong></strong>, as well as in saline, brackish or fresh estuarine waters, brackish lagoons <strong></strong>, and inland (very rarely) on large, deep freshwater lakes (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species shows a preference for marine foods during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>, its diet consisting predominantly of animal matter such as crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and cladocerans<strong></strong>), molluscs, other marine invertebrates (e.g. echinoderms, worms) and fish (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The species also takes freshwater insects and insect larvae ands well as plant material such as algae, grasses, and the seeds and fruits of tundra plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a natural depression on dry ground positioned in the open, amongst vegetation<strong></strong>, partially hidden by overhanging boulders<strong></strong> or under low shrubs (e.g. willows or dwarf birch) usually close to water (Johnsgard 1978, Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Although it is not a colonial species some pairs may nest in loose groups, and the species may also nest in association with Arctic Terns (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","<p>A major decline observed in the wintering population of the Long-tailed Duck in the Baltic Sea coincides with heavy bycatch mortality in gillnet fisheries, with an estimate of at least 90,000 birds (of different species) killed annually (Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2009). This species is highly susceptible to gillnet mortality and is the most frequently recorded victim in the eastern and south eastern Baltic Sea (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011), with annual mortality estimates ranging from 1 to 5% for the total Baltic Sea population (Bellebaum <em>et al.</em> 2013). Age ratios of gillnet victims in the southern Baltic suggest a decline in breeding success of c.75% over the 20th century (J. Bellebaum <em>in litt</em>. 2012). </p>  <p>The effects of chronic oil pollution from small-scale oil discharges in non-breeding areas is a significant threat as Long-tailed Ducks form large aggregations that overlap with major shipping and oil transportation routes. Further expansion of such activity in the northern part of the range is likely to increase the scope of this threat (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Large, catastrophic oil spills still occur, although the frequency of incidence has reduced (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Industrial activity within the breeding range poses a threat through direct mortality from oil pollution (Gorski <em>et al</em>. 1977, Kirby <em>et al.</em> 1993, Y. and O. Mineev <em>in litt.</em> 2012, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017) as well as the degradation and loss of wetland habitat due to petroleum pollution, drainage and peat-extraction (Grishanov 2006). Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, which are key prey items. In the Baltic, these activities are currently occurring at insufficient levels to be responsible for declines in waterbirds (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011). A mortality event in 2006-2007 ascribed to pollution resulted in ‘several thousand’ dead Long-tailed Ducks being washed up along the Hatpudirskaya bay coast (Y. and O. Mineev <em>in litt</em>. 2012). Development of large offshore wind farms could have negative effects on the species, through restricting access to foraging areas and by altering the suitability of benthic habitat.</p>  <p>The species has previously suffered heavy losses from avian cholera outbreaks (Friend 2006) and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Future outbreaks of disease may be expected and may compound observed declines in parts of the range. The introduced Round Goby <em>Neogobius melanostomus</em> has become established in the Baltic where it feeds on benthic invertebrates and could affect food supplies for Long-tailed Ducks, with unknown severity of impact (Almquist <em>et al</em>. 2010, Dagys 2017). The Round Goby appear to considerably reduce mussel density in shallow water (less than 20 m) in the Baltic Sea, and the numbers of Long-tailed Duck in these areas have decreased correspondingly (Hearn <em>et a</em>l. 2015).</p>  <p>The species is still hunted across the majority of its range (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The mortality from hunting has fallen considerably in line with the recorded decline in the species, partly due to reduced numbers of birds available but also as a result of tighter regulation and fewer active hunters (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2015). However, bag size has recently increased in Finland (19,400 birds in 2013), which may reflect greater numbers present during winter (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). The sustainability of present-day hunting levels is unclear, but these populations are already subject to significant mortality from other threats so require close monitoring. Previous hunting levels cannot be assumed to have been sustainable, and better quantification of additive mortality from all threats is needed to be confident in the size of any harvestable surplus (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  The results of autumn migration monitoring at various Baltic sites show that juveniles now represent a very low proportion of the population (Hario <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ellermaa <em>et al.</em> 2010), indicating that insufficient young are being raised to compensate for adult mortality (low recruitment). This low breeding success has been linked to the collapse of the formerly distinctive 3-4 year cycle of Arctic rodent abundance since the mid-1990s as a consequence of climate change, which may lead to greater rates of predation on alternative prey (Hario 2009, Iles <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, breeding success also appears to have declined in locations where rodents are absent, with poor female condition leading to bypassed breeding (A. Kondratyev <em>in litt.</em> 2012). In addition, ocean acidification may impact mollusc density and quality, further reducing prey availability (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009). More information about the effects of climate change on lower trophic levels is required, but prey density and size is likely to be impacted by changes in sea temperature, and key foraging ecologies may be altered, but there is uncertainty over whether resources are lost or have shifted their distribution.<br/><br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated to number 3,200,000 to 3,750,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2017).",Decreasing,"This species has a circumpolar range, breeding on the Arctic coasts of North America (<strong>Canada</strong>, Alaska, <strong>U.S.A.</strong> and <strong>Greenland</strong>), Europe (<strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>), and Asia (<strong>Russia</strong>). It winters at sea further south, as far as the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, South Carolina and Washington in the United States, <strong>Korea</strong> on the Asian Pacific coast, and other areas including the Black Sea and Caspian Sea (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). According to monitoring data from the Baltic Sea, where the western Siberian and northern European populations winter, the population there has declined significantly since the early 1990s at least (Hario <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ellermaa <em>et al.</em> 2010, Nilsson and Månsson 2010, Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011). An estimated total of c.4,272,000 individuals was counted there in 1992-1993, falling to c.1,486,000 individuals in 2007-2009, which suggests that a decline of c.65% has occurred over a period of 16 years (Skov <em>et al</em>. 2011). Research on the tundra of eastern European Russia since 1973 suggests that a steep decline may have occurred there (Y. and O. Mineev&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). There is no evidence to suggest that the geographical distribution of this population has shifted sufficiently to account for this decline (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011, L. Nilsson <em>in litt</em>. 2011, J. Bellebaum i<em>n litt.</em> 2012, M. Ellermaa <em>in litt.</em> 2012), though small increases in wintering numbers have been recorded in Finland. The estimation of a real and severe decline is supported by data from migration bottlenecks in the Gulf of Finland where the numbers observed on migration have fallen dramatically since the early 1990s at least (A. Lehikoinen <em>et al. in litt.</em> 2012).&#160;North America holds the second largest population (c.1 million birds [Wetlands International 2017]). The Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey (WBPHS) indicates large declines from the early 1950s but a relatively stable population since 1989 (Flint 2013); on a shorter time-scale, the population appears to have declined from 1980 to 2002 and then increased from 2007 to 2012 (Bowman <em>et al. </em>2015). Population trends vary among regional surveys; breeding numbers on the Arctic Coastal Plain were stable during 1986-2012 but increasing 2003-2012; on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding numbers were stable during 1988-2012 but decreased during 2003-2012; on western Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, breeding numbers probably decreased from 1992-94 to 2004-05; and on Kodiak Island, Alaska, wintering numbers were stable during 1991-2005 (Raven and Dickson 2006; Zwiefelhofer <em>et al. </em>2008; Stehn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;However, this species is especially poorly monitored because its breeding distribution is largely outside the area covered by breeding waterfowl surveys, and because of its offshore distribution during winter and the lack of comprehensive winter surveys (T. Bowman <em>in litt.</em> 2012).&#160;No trend data are available for the third largest population (c.1,600,000 birds [Wetlands International 2017]), which breeds in western Siberia and winters off eastern Asia. The fourth and smallest population (c.36,000–99,000 birds [Wetlands International 2017]), which breeds in Greenland and Iceland and winters in the north Atlantic, is poorly monitored and trends are uncertain, although it may have been stable until the 1990s (Wetlands International 2017).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Conservation Actions Underway</span><br/>CMS Appendix II.

Population trends outside Europe are unknown. Extrapolated over three generation lengths and allowing for uncertainty, the population is thought to be declining at a rate sufficient to be listed as Vulnerable. Should population trends become less uncertain both within and outside its European range it may merit uplisting or downlisting.","The species is exclusively marine, found on rocky coasts and offshore islands (Nettleship <em>et al</em>. 2014). It nests on grassy maritime slopes, sea cliffs and rocky slopes. During the winter it is wide-ranging, found in offshore and pelagic habitats.<br/><br/>The species is a pursuit-diver, catching most of its prey within 30 m of the water surface but&#160;capable of diving to 60 m (Piatt and Nettleship 1985, Burger and Simpson 1986)<sup></sup>. They prey on 'forage' species, including juvenile pelagic fishes, such as herring <em>Clupea harengus</em>, juvenile and adult capelin <em>Mallotus</em> <em>villosus</em>, and sandeel <em>Ammodytes</em> spp. (Barrett <em>et al</em>. 1987)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. At times, they also prey on juvenile demersal fishes, such as gadids; planktonic crustaceans; and polychaete worms (Harris and Hislop 1978, Barrett <em>et al. </em>1987, Martin 1989, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996, Harris <em>et al. </em>2015)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the southern and eastern parts of its range, sandeels usually form the majority of the prey fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973, Hislop and Harris 1985, Harris and Wanless 1986, Martin 1989, Harris and Riddiford 1989).&#160;However, there are exceptions, such as at Skomer Island in 1969 when sprat made up the majority of the diet fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973), and in the Lofoten islands, where first-year herring are often the commonest food of chicks (Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006).<br/><br/>When feeding chicks, birds generally forage within 10 km of their colony, but may range as far as 50 to 100 km or more (Harris 1984,&#160;Anker-Nilssen and Lorentsen 1990,&#160;Rodway and Montevecchi 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. A boat transect run on one day in 1970 found that 85% of all birds seen were concentrated within just 3 km of the colony (BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, but other studies have found peaks in the density of foraging birds at up to 40 km distance from the colony (Webb <em>et al.</em> 1985, Stone <em>et al.</em> 1992, Stone <em>et al. </em>1993, BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Similarly, surveys and GPS tracking at the Isle of May, Scotland, suggest that birds forage close to the breeding colony, but also at other sites up to 40 km away (Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1990, BirdLife International 2000, Harris <em>et al. </em>2012)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Various studies (Pearson 1968, Corkhill 1973, Bradstreet and Brown 1985, BirdLife International 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, based on different breeding colonies, have estimated the theoretical maximum foraging radius at anywhere from 32 km (Corkhill 1973)<strong><sup></sup></strong> to 200 km (Bradstreet and Brown 1985). <p></p>","<p>This species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as increased sea surface temperature (SST) and associated shifts in prey (e.g. Herring, Sandeel) distribution, abundance and quality (Durant<em> et al.</em> 2003, Sandvik<em> et al. </em>2005). Breeding failures are usually assumed to be due to food shortages (e.g. Martin 1989, Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006, Harris and Wanless 2011, Anker-Nilssen <em>et al.</em> 2016), as changing temperatures can cause mismatches between plankton blooms, prey abundance peaks and Puffin breeding seasons, leading to poor chick growth, shortened nesting periods and lower fledging success (Durant <em>et al. </em>2006). Sandvik <em>et al.</em> (2005) demonstrated decreased survival in North Atlantic seabirds (including the puffin) with increasing SST. There are several recorded examples of food stock collapse and its detrimental consequences for Puffins; The Sandeel population collapse near Shetland in 1985-1990 led to successive years of breeding failures (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2004), and another Sandeel crash in South and West Iceland and the Faroes in 2003-2005 led to food scarcity and collapse of Puffin populations with some colonies having 0% breeding success (Hansen and Sigurdsson <em>in litt. </em>2016).</p>  <p>Extreme weather and storms can cause mass mortality of seabirds, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter storms at sea, and represents a potentially growing threat due to the predicted increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (Melillo <em>et al. </em>2014). In Pop Witless Bay, extreme cold and wet weather in 2011 caused the death of thousands of chicks across Witless Bay Reserve (Wilhelm <em>et al.</em> 2015). A severe wreck in March 2016 also delayed breeding on Isle of May (Newell 2016). The 2002 Norway wreck could have caused the death of as many as 100,000 birds, diagnosed as prolonged exposure to adverse feeding conditions at sea (but may also have been caused by disease or climatic factors affecting prey abundance) (Anker-Nilssen<em> et al.</em> 2013). A large wreck occurred in March 2013 along the coast of Scotland/northeastern UK, also coinciding with periods of extreme weather (3,055 and 1,364 birds collected on Scottish and English coast, respectively), where the majority died of starvation, likely due to difficulty feeding at sea (Harris and Elkins 2013). Productivity fell to 0.46 in the Farne islands in 2015 due to flooding caused by two major storms that destroyed nests with chicks (Wildlife review 2015). More such examples have been recorded throughout the species’ range.</p>  <p>The threat of climate change to food stocks is exacerbated by the unsustainable harvesting of prey species by commercial fisheries, causing further reductions in food availability and subsequent low breeding success (Breton and Diamond 2014). Major fisheries have been noted as contributing to the collapse of key prey fish species since the 1960s and been linked to reproductive failure at colonies such as Røst, Norway (reduced recruitment due to food shortage in breeding season is considered the most likely cause of decline during 1986-2012) (Tasker <em>et al. </em>2000, Anker-Nilssen <em>et al.</em> 2003, Miles <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition to overharvesting of prey stocks, commercial fisheries are a cause of direct mortality. The Atlantic Puffin’s foraging strategy (diving) makes the species susceptible to being caught in gillnets and other fishing gear, but bycatch has not been recorded in significantly large numbers (Tasker <em>et al.</em> 2000, Rogan and Mackey 2007) and likely has a “trivial effect” on Puffin populations (Harris and Wanless 2011).</p>  <p>At the breeding colonies, the species is vulnerable to invasive predators. American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em> is known to take puffins from burrows, and the escape of mink from fur farms in Iceland in the early 1930s drove many colonies to extinction in the following decades (Harris and Wanless 2011). Mink are still causing low rates of chick survival in parts of the range, including Hornøya, Norway (Barrett 2015). Rats <em>Rattus</em> spp. depredate eggs and chicks and have been linked to drastic colony declines and local extinctions in Sweden (Harris and Wanless 2011), on the Faroe Islands (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007), Lundy Island (Lock 2006), Shiant Islands (Lockley 1953), and Ailsa Craig and Puffin Islands (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2004) (see also TemaNord 2010). Recolonisation and population recovery can be seen after rat eradication (Lock 2006).</p>  <p>Hunting of puffins, mostly for human consumption, is allowed on the Faeroe Islands and Iceland (Thorup <em>et al. </em>2014), yet uncontrolled harvesting in nesting grounds may lead to local declines. Adult birds are taken during the nesting season, thus causing reduced reproductive success and significant adult mortality, in addition to the general effects of disturbance. 10,000 individuals were recorded to be taken annually in the Nólsoy colony (Faeroes) and 150,000 in Iceland. This is suspected to limit recovery of populations and may exceed recruitment rate on Iceland, while the Nólsoy population is considered stable only due to migration (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007). The species is particularly vulnerable to disturbance when nesting, and human intrusion associated with other recreational activities (tourism, walks) may also impact the species. Nest desertions have been recorded (Nettleship <em>et al. </em>2014), and at one study site a 40% decrease in breeding success was seen in a frequently visited area compared to the control site (Rodway<em> et al. </em>1996).</p>  <p>The species is also vulnerable to oil spills and other forms of marine pollution. Past oil spills have had severe impacts on affected puffin populations; the wreck of the Torrey Canyon in 1967 was linked to decline in puffin numbers at Sept-Iles (Brittany) and the wreck of the oil tanker Amoco Cadiz (1978) badly affected moulting puffins in the region, killing 1,391 confirmed puffins which coincided with a 44% reduction in the Sept-Iles population. The number of Puffins killed is likely an underestimate, as many will not be recovered or identified on beaches after wrecks (Harris and Wanless 2011). Oiled puffins are often unable to fly, accentuating the effects of reduced food supplies and extreme weather preventing feeding. However, other oil spills seem to have had less effect on Puffin populations; the Tricolor spill in 2003 (Netherlands) was not found to have been a major cause of a local puffin wreck (35% of birds were oiled, most after death) (Camphuysen 2003). Nonetheless, the greatest impact of oil spills is likely to be on long-term condition of adults and ecosystem degradation, imposing a further risk to the Atlantic Puffin’s food resources. Various incidences of other marine pollutants have been recorded in the species; in 1970 21% of carcasses found in Scotland, and 22% of those shot off the coast of Norway contained elastic threads and other plastic particles (nylon thread, plastic beads etc). Given that the same proportion of pollutants were measured in healthy and deceased Puffins on Isle of May, pollution is regarded unlikely to be the primary cause of death, but may still pose a risk by accumulating over time and accentuating other threats for individuals already compromised by low food availability, adverse climatic conditions or hunting. The highest proportion of pollutants were found in first year birds, which may be explained by higher mortality among young birds with higher loads and only the less polluted birds reaching adulthood (Harris and Wanless 2011).  </p><p>Increasing numbers of offshore windfarms could result in displacement, but the risk of collision is considered very low (Bradbury <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, a study into puffin vision suggests they may be vulnerable to collision with man-made objects related to underwater wind farms (Martin and Wanless 2015).<br/></p>","The European population is estimated to be 4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, which equates to 9,550,000-11,600,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The global population size is estimated at&#160;12–14 million mature individuals (Harris and Wanless 2011; Berglund and Hentati-Sundberg 2014).",Decreasing,"The Atlantic Puffin can be found throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, from north-west Greenland (<strong>to </strong><strong>Denmark</strong>) to the coastline of Newfoundland (<strong>Canada</strong>) and Maine (<strong>USA</strong>) in the west, and from north-west <strong>Russia&#160;</strong>down to the Canary Islands, <strong>Spain</strong> (in winter) in the east (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. The population in <strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>, which together account for 80% of the European population, decreased markedly since the early 2000s (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;In much of Iceland breeding has generally failed every year since 2003, but in the north, at least, it has been borderline sustainable (G. A. Gudmundsson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015, E. Hansen <em>in litt. </em>2016, A. Petersen <em>in litt. </em>2016). The largest Norwegian colony, Røst, has experienced sharp declines&#160;from almost 1.5 million breeding pairs in 1979 to only 289,000 pairs in 2015, and has produced virtually no chicks in the last 9 years&#160;(T. Anker-Nilssen <em>in litt</em>. 2015, Anker-Nilssen <em>et al. </em>2016). Most other Norwegian colonies are much smaller, including that at Runde, which has also declined; however most colonies remain unmonitored (A. O. Folkestad&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015, T. Anker-Nilssen <em>in litt</em>. 2015, 2016). Numbers on the southern coast of the Barents Sea have increased such that declines in the total population in Norway are estimated at approximately 33% since the early 1980s (Fauchald <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Populations in the Faroe Islands (Denmark) and Greenland are also reported to be decreasing (BirdLife International 2015).<br/>The population size was estimated to be increasing in the U.K. during 1969-2000, and populations in the North Sea are probably currently stable or increasing after a decline in the 2000s due to two very low overwinter survivals of adults (Harris and Wanless 2011,&#160;<a>Harris <em>et al.</em> 2013</a>).&#160;A reduction in the recruitment of juveniles into the breeding population is thought to be the most likely factor involved in a sharp decrease in the number of puffins at the Fair Isle (U.K.) breeding colony; from approximately 20,200 individuals in 1986 to 10,700 individuals in 2012 (Miles&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Adult survival probability remained similar across the 27 years of the study, whilst breeding success, the number of feeding visits by adults to chicks and the size of available prey fish all decreased. Trends from North America are uncertain, with the population at Great Island, Witless Bay showing increases between 1979 and 1994, but it has potentially stabilised or is in decline now (Wilhelm <em>et al. </em>2015). A restoration project off the coast of Maine has also had some success (D.

The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory and breeds from April or May to June or August (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in isolated solitary pairs (Fjeldsa 2004), sometimes also nesting in loose colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) of up to c.20 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). Post-breeding adults undergo a flightless wing-moulting period (Fjeldsa 2004) after which they migrate south either singly or in small loose flocks, with concentrations of over 2,000 individuals occurring at favoured staging sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). During the winter the species typically feeds singly and rarely aggregates into flocks (Fjeldsa 2004). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on small (less than 3 ha), shallow (less than 2 m deep) inland waters with abundant emergent vegetation&#160;(e.g. reedbeds),&#160;and stretches of open water, showing a preference for waters in forested areas or in shrub tundra further to the north (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldsa 2004). Suitable habitats include small pools and lakes, backwaters of large rivers, pools cut off from the sea in estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and coastal lagoons (Fjeldsa 2004). In coastal locations the species often makes foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas, and if foraging at sea it shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). <em>Non-breeding</em> When moulting, on passage or during the winter the species frequents large inland lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldsa 2004) or shallow coastal areas (Fjeldsa 2004) with abundant fish stocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), often considerable distances from the shore, amongst islands in archipelagos or over drop-off zones (Fjeldsa 2004). When foraging at sea the species shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of invertebrates (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as adult and larval aquatic insects (e.g. water beetles, water bugs and dragonfly larvae), crayfish and molluscs (Konter 2001), although fish are also be important locally or seasonally (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species typically breeds in isolated pairs with more than 50 m between neighbouring nests (Fjeldsa 2004), although in some cases (e.g. on predator-free islands of floating vegetation attached to emergent vegetation beds) semi-colonial nesting may occur (Fjeldsa 2004).","<p>The introduction of large fish, such as the non-native Rainbow Trout, to many inland waterbodies for freshwater fisheries and recreational fishing has resulted in greatly increased resource competition for invertebrate and smaller fish prey (HELCOM Red List 2013). The productivity and suitability of waterbodies used by the species is also thought to be impacted by the expansion of timber plantations throughout the boreal zone, however, the impacts of this are presently unknown. The species is also highly susceptible to bycatch in gillnets, with tens to hundreds caught annually in the Baltic Sea (Zydelis <em>et al</em>. 2013). This is considered likely to be the driver of a very rapid decline over the past few decades in the Baltic Sea (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011) but represents only a small part of the global wintering range. Bycatch is also a threat in North American coastal waters.</p>  Red-necked Grebes were among the species most severely impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, demonstrating little recovery in numbers within three years (Day <em>et al.</em> 1997). However, its very large range places only a small proportion at risk of direct mortality in a single incident. Persistent organochlorine pollution has been documented to reduce egg viability dramatically in the past, thus greatly reducing reproductive success (De Smet 1987), but bans on the use of such compounds has reduced the threat this poses to populations. Many freshwater sites throughout the breeding range have become eutrophied through the effects of agricultural run-off and large-scale freshwater fisheries, the impact of which is unknown. It is considered to be at relatively high risk of collision with wind turbines and other offshore infrastructure due to undertaking nocturnal flights and having only low manoeuvrability (Garthe and Hüppop 2004), although the effect of this on the population has not been quantified. The species has also been recognised as a species of high vulnerability to climate change in a full life-cycle assessment in America (Culp <em>et al.</em> 2017), but actual impacts presently unknown.","The global   population is estimated to number c.190,000-290,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015), while national population estimates include:   c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs, c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and   c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in China; &lt; c.100 breeding pairs, &lt;   c.50 individuals on migration and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in   Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on   migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).&#160;The European population is estimated at 27,700-47,900 pairs, which equates to 55,400-95,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species can be found in western <strong>Canada</strong>, north-west <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, eastern <strong>Russia</strong>, north-east <strong>China</strong> and northern <strong>Japan</strong>, wintering from Japan and <strong>Korea</strong> through the Aleutian Islands to California (both U.S.A.), and off eastern the U.S.A. south to Florida.

It also attends trawlers and will form large congregations where food is plentiful. Breeding is highly seasonal starting between March and April, usually in large colonies on cliffs and offshore islands, but also sometimes on the mainland. Young birds will migrate to the extreme south of its range, whereas adults range less extensively but still regularly winter in the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","Northern Gannets are consistently recorded as bycatch across fisheries in the Atlantic. It is the species most freqently killed as bycatch in fisheries assessed in Portuguese Atlantic waters, and captured at a relatively high rate in demersal longline operations, but also set-nets and purse-seines (Oliveira&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Total estimates of numbers killed are lacking. In nearshore water off the east coast of the U.S., estimates of under 500 individuals per year suggest that population level impacts may be relatively small; however, this is derived from observers on less than 5% of fisheries within a small proportion of the range, and there is no cumulative assessment of impact (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). Considering the observation of bycatch in fisheries across the range of the Northern Gannet (Smith and Morgan 2005, García-Barcelona&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010, Oliviera <em>et al. </em>2015) and evidence of increased breeding populations following the closure of Canadian gillnet fisheries (Regular <em>et al. </em>2013),&#160;levels of bycatch are sufficient to cause significant declines in the species.

Goats and pigs denuded the island’s vegetation, likely degrading Trinidade Petrel breeding habitat, but were eradicated in 2004 and 1965 respectively (Alves <em>et al.</em> 2011, Kruger <em>et al</em>. 2018). Mice are the only remaining invasive mammal on Trinidade Island and have been seen foraging eggs from seabird nests (Alves <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2011) as well as eating seeds thereby slowing the rate of vegetation regrowth, this is unlikely to have a significant effect on the Trinidade Petrel as it nests in relatively inaccessible areas with little vegetation.</p>  There is some potential for effects due to human development.

Existing demographic studies of populations in France and Malta indicate a population decline, caused by low breeding success due to predation by introduced mammals and low adult survival owing to fisheries bycatch and predation. However, some more recent studies have shown population increases and there may be large as yet undiscovered colonies in the Eastern Mediterranean or the Black Sea. If further study and monitoring provide evidence of large stable or increasing populations, the species may warrant downlisting in the future.</p><p></p> <p></p>","It breeds in burrows, rocky cavities or big caves on rocky coastal and offshore islets, and on steep, inaccessible cliffs on the mainland. In the non-breeding season it disperses widely within the Mediterranean and Black Seas, often congregating in large flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998).<p></p>","<p>The most serious threat to the species is mortality from incidental capture in commercial and artisanal fisheries, followed by predation by invasive predators (predominantly Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> and to a lesser extent, Feral Cats <em>Felis catus</em>). A study in France and Malta (Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2011) implicated fishing bycatch as a critical cause of mortality for the species, since the majority of the adult mortality of birds breeding in Malta occurred during the non-breeding season, and adult survival in France remained low after feral cat removal. This pattern is consistent with the presumed cause of low adult survival probabilities in the Balearic Shearwater <em>Puffinus mauretanicus </em>(Oro <em>et al</em>. 2004, Tavecchia <em>et al</em>. 2008, Genovart <em>et al</em>. 2016). Long-liners in particular affect the species (Arcos <em>et al</em>. 2008, Louzao <em>et al</em>. 2011, Militao <em>et al</em>. 2013), often on an irregular basis, but impacting fairly large numbers at a time. Since <em>Procellariiforms </em>are generally long-lived, their populations are highly sensitive to changes in adult survival. The increased adult mortality induced by bycatch is therefore a significant danger to them and a highly important threat (Lebreton 2000). Breeding success may also be affected by reduced abundance of anchovies and sprats due to competition from fisheries (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008). Direct persecution (bird shooting) remains pervasive in Malta, and both legal and illegal shooting activities have affected many local bird populations for decades (Magnin 1986, Raine 2007, Raine and Temuge 2009). Illegal shooting was likely responsible for the extremely low survival rates between 1969 and 1994 (Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>The species has been shown to suffer substantial predation pressure by introduced mammalian predators on breeding grounds (Bourgeois <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bonnaud <em>et al</em>. 2009) with observed population declines in Italy being attributed to alien predators, predominantly rats (Capizzi <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sultana and Borg 2006). Rats are thought to limit reproductive success by depredating chicks and eggs, as evinced from nest traces (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2000). The Italian population of Yelkouan Shearwaters accounts for more than half of the global population and black rats are present on about 85% of the Italian islands, and on virtually all of those larger than 10 ha (Baccetti <em>et al</em>. 2009). On the Tavolara archipelago, Italy, the colony size has been much reduced in the last 30 years and vast sectors of the islands have been deserted; breeding success was assessed for the first time in 2006 and it was found to be zero in several colonies, attributed to rat predation (J. J. Borg <em>in litt</em>. 2006). However, Martin <em>et al</em>. (2000) detected no significant effect of rats on the distribution of Mediterranean Shearwaters, highlighting that rats were introduced to the Mediterranean islands more than 2000 years ago and the communities have had time to reach an equilibrium. They also showed that larger bird species, on larger islands appear to be more resistant and are able to maintain healthy population sizes in the presence of rats. Local extinctions by rats seem to have been concentrated on the smaller islands. Feral cats are another major threat. On the Hyères islands, cats have been identified as the primary predator of the species. Shearwater remains were found in up to 6% of cat scats, representing hundreds of adults killed each year, especially during the pre-breeding period (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008). The population on Port-Cros increased following feral cat eradication, implying that cat eradication may have led to higher recruitment in addition to a modest increase in adult survival (Bonnaud <em>et al</em>. 2012). The high level of cat predation on Levant Island in the Hyères islands could result in the extinction of the colony within four decades (Bonnaud <em>et al</em>. 2012). </p>  <p>Increasing tourism and coastal urbanization in the Mediterranean create sound and light pollution at colonies and causes disturbance and damage to fragile breeding habitats (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008, Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2011). The gregarious behaviour of this species makes it particularly vulnerable to oil spills and the intense maritime traffic in the Mediterranean and Bosporus increases the risk of spillage events. Light pollution at sea from bunkering areas, oil platforms and other at-sea structures may be an important threat for some colonies. Less prominent threats include collisions with off-shore wind farms (Raine <em>et al</em>. 2010), competition with native Scopoli’s Shearwaters <em>Calonectris diomedea </em>for nest sites (Bourgeois <em>et al</em>. 2015), pollution and contaminants including plastic (R. Crnkovic <em>in litt</em>. 2012, Codina-García <em>et al</em>. 2013), PCB (Bourgeois <em>et al</em>. 2011) and other organic contaminants. Two out of four eggs analysed on the Hyères islands exhibited PCB levels of concern and contamination could have caused breeding failure in these cases. Despite small sample sizes, Bourgeois <em>et al</em>.’s (2011) findings implied a high variability of contamination levels. It has also been suggested that the location of breeding sites along rocky coastlines and cavities in unstable substrates make the species vulnerable to changes in rainfall or storm surge intensity under climate change, but this potential threat is currently not supported empirically (Bourgeois <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p></p>","Figures point to a total of 15,337-30,519 pairs, roughly equating to 46,000-92,000 individuals, based on a population assessment covering the species's entire range (Derhé 2012). However, this number is at odds with preliminary counts conducted in early February when c. 75,000-90,000 individuals have been recorded migrating through the Bosporus [J. Tavares and D. Sahin. <em>in litt. </em>2012, D. Sahin <em>in litt. </em>2015]), at a time when most breeders are already around their colonies in Malta, France, and Italy. More surveys are urgently needed to confirm breeding population sizes, particularly in the Aegean Sea and in Turkey.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is endemic to the Mediterranean basin, but its precise distribution is not well known and numbers are disputed (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008). The main breeding colonies are concentrated in the central and eastern basin of the Mediterranean, from Sardinia&#160;through the central Mediterranean, the Adriatic and the Aegean (Borg <em>et al.</em> 2010). The species is known to breed in <strong>France</strong> (627-1044,&#160;Cadiou 2015), <strong>Italy</strong> (9,000-20,000 pairs, 12,791-19,774 according to BirdLife International 2015), <strong>Malta</strong> (1,370-2,000 pairs, according to Barbara <em>et al. </em>2015), <strong>Algeria</strong> (8-10 pairs), <strong>Tunisia</strong> (176-200 pairs), <strong>Croatia</strong> (300-500 pairs, 300-400 pairs according to BirdLife International 2015), <strong>Albania</strong> (1-10 pairs), <strong>Greece</strong> (4,000-7,000 pairs) and <strong>Bulgaria</strong> (0-10 pairs) giving a global estimate of 15,300-30,500 pairs according to Derhé (2012) and 19,400-31,200 pairs according to BirdLife International (2015). Breeding is assumed in <strong>Turkey</strong> on offshore islands or mainland cliffs in the Aegean and Mediterranean, but so far no colonies have been identified and more surveys are needed (D. Sahin <em>in litt.</em> 2015).</p><p>A small population may also breed on the eastern Balearic Islands in <strong>Spain</strong>, although the existence of the species here is somewhat controversial, given the taxonomic uncertainty of the birds breeding in Menorca (Arcos 2011, Curé <em>et al. </em>2010, Genovart <em>et al. </em>2012). During the non-breeding season some birds migrate north-eastwards towards the Black Sea, although some birds may remain close to breeding colonies or disperse around the Mediterranean (Militao <em>et al.</em> 2013, Péron <em>et al.</em> 2013, Raine <em>et al.</em> 2013, Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014). More than 90,000 individuals were recorded passing through the Bosphorous in early February 2014 (D. Sahin <em>in litt.</em> 2015), at a time when most breeders in France and Malta have usually returned to their colonies.</p><p>Population trends in Albania, Algeria, Bulgaria, Greece, Tunisia, Croatia, France and Turkey are currently unknown (BirdLife International 2015). The population has been estimated to be declining rapidly in Italy (N. Baccetti <em>in litt.</em> 2011), however trends reported for the European Red List of Birds suggest the population may be increasing (BirdLife International 2015). The reported increase in the Italian population is highly dependent on the trend of the most important breeding site, Tavolara, where numbers are thought to be steadily increasing (E. Dupre, L. Serra <em>in litt.</em> 2015). However it is not clear whether reported increases are a result of changes in methodologies for monitoring population trends (N. Baccetti <em>in litt. </em>2015). Declines have previously been reported for France (Bonnaud <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2012) and Malta (Borg and Sultana 2002, Raine <em>et al</em>. 2009, Sultana <em>et al.</em> 2011; Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2011), although the Maltese population was reported as increasing in the 2015 European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015) but this may be as a result of better knowledge of the species rather than a genuine increase (B. Metzger in litt. 2015). Nine colonies have gone extinct over the last 60 years (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008) and since 2009, one breeding colony off Sardinia (San Pietro Island) has been reported as absent, possibly extinct (N. Baccetti <em>in litt.</em> 2011), and no breeding has been recorded anymore in Corsica (Cadiou 2015). Most worryingly, breeding success at many colonies appears to be extremely low and adult survival probabilities across the western Mediterranean have been reported as too low to maintain stable populations (Oppel <em>et al. </em>2011).</p><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation&#160;</strong><strong>and Research&#160;</strong><strong>Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>EU Birds Directive Annex I; Annex II of the Bern Convention.

A rat eradication on Montecristo Island, Italy was completed in 2012 and has increased the breeding success of Yelkouan Shearwaters.

There is a species action plan (SAP) being prepared for this species by the French partner of Birdlife (La Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux), in collaboration with the Yelkouan Shearwater working group, and within the framework of the LIFE EuroSAP.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Determine whether the species breeds in Turkey. Search for colonies at sites in Greece and Tunisia.&#160;Carry out population censuses&#160;at breeding colonies for which there is currently little reliable, up-to-date population size data, particularly&#160;those in Sardinia, Sicily and Greece.&#160;Continue breeding and non-breeding period counts at the Bosphorus and conduct breeding and non-breeding counts at other bottleneck sites. Research ecological requirements and carry out extensive demographic monitoring. Research the impact of introduced predators across breeding range. Research impact of predator control/ eradication programmes on annual survival and breeding success at different sites. As a precaution, control or if possible eradicate feral cats and rats at breeding colonies, according to a priority analysis and at sites with evidence of predation.&#160;Quantify extent of mortality from accidental bycatch.&#160;Encourage policymakers to implement and enforce measures that reduce accidental bycatch of Yelkouan Shearwaters and other seabirds in commercial fishing operations in the Mediterranean and Black seas. Propose the species for listing on Annex I of ACAP to address seabird bycatch (C. Carboneras&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2015).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong></strong><strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is highly migratory (Madge and Burn 1988<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span>del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">)</span><strong></strong> and breeds from mid-May onwards<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988) in solitary pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, occasionally nesting in association with gull or tern colonies<strong> </strong>(Kear 2005). Non-breeding birds spend the breeding season in flocks on open water<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). After breeding (from June onwards [Scott and Rose 1996]) the adults migrate to moulting sites<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(males travelling and moulting before the females)<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988), <strong></strong>where they become flightless for 3-4 weeks<strong></strong>  (Scott and Rose 1996). When moulting and overwintering the species is  highly sociable and can occur in large flocks (Madge and Burn 1988,  Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> of several thousands of individuals<strong></strong> (Scott and Rose 1996), although it is more common in small scattered groups of c.100 individuals<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species mainly forages by diving and may feed at depths of 30-40 m during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on wooded<strong><sup> </sup></strong>coastlines (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, small freshwater lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, pools and rivers<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998) in northern coniferous forests (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, wooded Arctic tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong> and alpine zones (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>,  especially where there are boulder-covered or small rocky islands  available for nesting with extensive herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and  low trees <strong></strong>(Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> The majority winter at sea on shallow inshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>, especially in estuaries or inlets where there are large mussel-beds<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also occur on freshwater lakes and estuaries during migration<strong> </strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, as well as crustaceans, worms, echinoderms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), amphipods, isopods<strong></strong> (Kear 2005), small fish, and (in freshwater habitats) adult and larval insects<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species may also consume plant material on its breeding grounds<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. leaves and shoots)<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression positioned on the ground<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in tall grass, among hummocks or under bushes<strong> </strong>(Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), usually within 100 m of open water (occasionally up to 2-3 km away)<strong></strong> (Kear 2005). The species usually nests in solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005),<strong></strong> but it may form loose congregations (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong> (e.g. on islands [Kear 2005]) with neighbouring nests as close as 3 m apart <strong></strong>(Snow and Perrins 1998), and will also nest in association with gull or tern colonies<strong></strong> (Kear 2005).<strong></strong> <p></p>","<p>The species is highly susceptible to bycatch in fishing nets and is likely to be also caught in derelict fishing gear as observed for other scoter species (e.g. Good <em>et al.</em> 2009). The species may also suffer from resource competition with commercial fisheries exploiting marine benthic organisms and shellfish (Kear 2005).  </p><p>Climate change is expected to impact this species in a number of ways. Remote sensing has shown the shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in Siberia which provide important breeding grounds for this species (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration has been linked to declining Scoter populations in North America and this is likely due to trophic mismatch, so may also affect Siberian populations (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Siberian Scoter diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>During moulting and winter aggregations, the species is highly susceptible to oil spills and other marine pollutants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005) and one catastrophic oil spill could potentially destroy a large proportion of the global population if it occurred in a key moulting or wintering area (Madge and Burn 1988). Oil and gas exploration is a pervasive threat in the Arctic and is likely to increase in the future (Poland <em>et al</em>. 2003, Henderson and Loe 2014), with human exploitation of natural resources in the taiga and lower tundra regions of its breeding range causing habitat degradation (Kear 2005). </p>  <p>The footprint of large offshore wind farms may exclude Siberian Scoter from some foraging areas and through disturbance, as it does reduce duck densities more than other seabird groups (Garthe and Hüppop 2004, Stewart <em>et al. </em>2007), however the impact on other scoter species appears minor and the majority of the Siberian Scoter's range does not have any current plans for large-scale wind farms. Collision mortality is also likely to be a minor threat as collisions rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared with other species groups, which is consistent with their high avoidance rates at offshore wind farms (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). </p>  <p>There is a small risk that future outbreaks of H5N1 (avian influenza) could pose a risk to the species (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is mostly asymptomatic in wild birds and there is no record of significant mortality in this species. </p>  <p></p><strong></strong><p></p>","The global population has been estimated at 600,000-1,000,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), probably including c.400,000-700,000 mature individuals, on the basis that they account for around 2/3 of the population.",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It now requires an urgent acceleration in targeted conservation actions in order to prevent it from becoming functionally extinct within a few decades. <p></p> <p></p>","This species inhabits arid and semi-arid grasslands with scattered short scrub, bushes and low intensity cultivation in flat or gently undulating terrain. Birds congregate in traditional less disturbed grassland patches to breed during mid-summer and monsoon. It nests in open ground, laying only one clutch (consisting of one and very rarely two eggs) per year. Outside of breeding season, it probably makes local and possibly long distance nomadic movements (largely unknown) in response to various factors, using areas rich in food resources and surrounded by natural grass-scrub habitat (including agricultural fields [G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016]) for easy navigation. It requires different microhabitat envelopes for different activities, such as grasslands with relatively tall (vegetation 25-100cm) and dense cover, high insect resources and less grazing for nesting; short sparse vegetation (&lt;25 cm vegetation) on slightly elevated ground for display; sparse vegetation (&lt;25 cm vegetation) with minimal scrub for roosting; and moderate (25-50 cm) vegetation or medium sized trees for shade or roosting (Rahmani 1989, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","Historically, widespread hunting for sport and food precipitated its decline, accelerated by vehicular access to remote areas. High intensity poaching still continues in Pakistan (which is probably shared with western Rajasthan and Kachchh populations), where 49 birds were hunted out of 63 that were sighted over a period of four years (Khan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Some poaching continues in India as well (Sridhar 2005, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011, Anon. 2013a, Anon. 2015), including one documented case where mine-workers that lost their livelihoods when mines near Gwalior were closed for the creation of the Ghatigaon Bustard Sanctuary hunted bustards to undermine the criteria on which the area was first designated as a sanctuary (Sridhar 2005). Additionally, in 2012, a bird was poached inside the protected area in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan (P. Patil&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012, G. Bhardwaj&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Hunting was also prevalent in Maharashtra in the past (Anon. 2015).&#160;Egg-collecting was rampant in many states during the early 19th century, and prevails very sporadically in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011). <br/><br/>However, the current threats are mostly from habitat loss and degradation, caused by; 1) widespread agricultural expansion and mechanization of farming; 2) infrastructural development such as irrigation (including a canal at Nannaj GIB Sanctuary [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]), roads, electricity pylons, wind turbines and constructions; 3) mining and industrialization; 4) well intended but ill-informed habitat management (Singh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006); and 5) lack of community support (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2011, 2013, 2015). With increased availability of water due to Government irrigation policies, agriculture has spread over vast arid–semiarid grasslands. For example, the Indira Gandhi Nahar Project has caused drastic hydraulic changes and massive agricultural conversion in and around the Desert National Park Sanctuary. Moreover, irrigation facilities and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in the crop pattern from bustard–friendly traditional monsoonal crops (sorghum, millet, etc.) to cash crops (sugarcane, grapes, cotton, horticulture, etc.), which are not suitable for the species. Due to ill-defined land distribution policies and the ambiguity arising from segregated ownership between private, community and government bodies, encroachment is a major problem in many bustard areas, especially in and around bustard sanctuaries of Maharashtra, Kachchh and Rajasthan. <br/><br/>Activities such as mining, stone quarrying, growth of industries, heavy pesticide use, grassland conversion and power projects along with the expansion of roads, electricity pylons, wind turbines, solar energy projects and other infrastructures have increased the severity of habitat degradation and disturbance (Anon 2015).&#160;The population in Madhya Pradesh has been lost due to trespassing, encroachment, mining and quarrying activities (Anon. 2015).&#160;Two individuals in Maharashtra (P. Patil <em>in litt</em> 2011) and one individual in Kachchh were reportedly killed by collisions with power-lines (Gadhavi 2014). Traditionally, grasslands and scrub have been considered as wasteland and the Forest Department policy, until recently, has been to convert them to forests with plantation of fuel/fodder shrub/tree species, even exotics like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Prosopis juliflora</span>,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><em>Acacia tortilis</em>,<em>&#160;</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gliricidia&#160;</span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eucalyptus </span>spp., under social forestry and compensatory afforestation schemes (Forest (Conservation) Act 1988; Indian Forest Act 1927) resulting in further loss of habitat. Afforestation has been highlighted as a problem at five sites used by the species:&#160;Thar desert (Rajasthan),&#160;Naliya (Gujarat), Nannaj (Maharashtra), Ranibennur (Kamataka) and Rollapadu (Andhra Pradesh) (Anon. 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016, G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016). Overgrazing on unprotected lands has also led to degradation of some areas (Mathew 2007, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Anon. 2013c, P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011), especially in the Thar desert (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016), and nest failure is commonly attributed to trampling by livestock (Anon. 2013c, Collar and Kirwan 2015). Hunting and egg collection remains a threat (Anon. 2014a). Free-ranging dogs pose a threat at all sites in India through disturbance of nesting adults and destruction of eggs (Anon. 2014c, 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015), while free-ranging pigs may also pose a threat (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Nests may also be predated by House Crows (<em>Corvus splendens</em>) (Collar and Kirwan 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Antagonism towards the species by local people is a major threat, and one reported to be increasing around Desert National Park Sanctuary due to political interests of local leaders (Anon. 2015). <p></p>","The species's total population was estimated at c. 300 individuals in 2008, indicating that there are probably fewer than 250 mature individuals remaining, hence the population is placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species&#160;occurs in the Indian Subcontinent, with former strongholds in the Thar desert in the north-west and the Deccan tableland of the Peninsula (BirdLife International 2001). It has been extirpated from 90% of its former range and is now principally confined to Rajasthan. In 2014 a survey of the Thar Desert, Rajasthan,&#160;estimated the species was present at a density of 0.61 ± 0.36 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, yielding abundance estimates of 103 ± 62 in the sampled area (16.9 km<sup>2</sup>) and 155 ± 94 individuals in the Thar landscape (25,488 km<sup>2</sup>). During the survey, 38 individuals were detected (Dutta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), and surveys in 2015 found 40 individuals (G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016). Smaller&#160;populations (likely to be considerably fewer than 15-20 birds [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]) are present in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, with birds now absent from Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2015), <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>. It is also reported to breed in <strong>Pakistan</strong>, however, information on breeding activity has not been published (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Recent declines have been noted in several areas, including Maharashtra (Kasambe<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2006, P. Patil<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2011, Anon. 2015), Kachchh (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012) and Rajasthan (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015). In Maharashtra, the latest population estimates suggest a population as low as 10 individuals (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2016, G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016), and numbers have been falling in the Bustard Sanctuary since at least the late 1980s, with the 2010 census recording only nine individuals and only three individuals (one male and two females) recorded in 2014 (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2014), while breeding has not been recorded there since 2007 at least (P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). A recent survey in Nashik, Maharashtra failed to find the species (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2014), whilst a survey in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra provided an estimate of six or seven birds between April 2012 and May 2013 (Anon. 2014b). Populations in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are considered at risk of local extinction (Anon. 2015).&#160;In Kachchh the latest population estimate is fewer than 20 birds at densities of 0.05 per km<sup>2</sup> in c. 400 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The species is likely to be close to disappearing from Karnataka (Kumara and Mohan Raj 2007, S. Kottur <em>in litt</em>.), and it is thought to have completely disappeared from the states of Haryana, Punjab, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2015), India, but some apparently survive in&#160;Pakistan, with reports from several localities (Khan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, Anon. 2013c, B. Lechleiter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011). Indian states in order of importance for the species are as follows: Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (Anon. 2015). Sites in order of priority for the species are: Desert National Park Sanctuary (Rajasthan), Naliya (Gujarat), Warora (Maharashtra) and Bellary (Karnataka) (Anon. 2015).<br/><br/>Its total population has declined from an estimated 1,260 individuals in 1969 to c. 300 individuals in 2008 (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010), equivalent to a reduction of c. 82% over 47 years (three generations), assuming an exponential trend. The results of a recent genetic study, in which the effective population size was estimated from the diversity of mitochondrial DNA, provide support for an estimate of fewer than 1,000 birds, and likely about 500 during the period 2006-2010, when samples were collected (Ishtiaq <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). This study found very low genetic diversity for such a widespread species, probably owing to a bottleneck event caused by its widespread extermination possibly even before the mid 19th century (Ishtiaq <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Population viability analysis predicts a high probability of local extinction within 50 years for populations numbering fewer than 30 individuals, with the more secure population of over 100 individuals showing sensitivity to the loss of one additional adult each year to human causes, indicating that present levels of off-take are unsustainable (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Current levels of hunting may result in the extinction of even the largest western Indian population in the next 15-20 years (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. In India it is legally protected under&#160;Schedule 1 (<span lang=""EN-IN"">Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act 2002 [<span lang=""EN-IN"">Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India&#160;2003])&#160;and there are severe  penalties for killing an individual. It has been the focus of several  publicity initiatives aimed at reducing hunting. Since 1981, extensive  fieldwork has investigated its status, distribution and ecology, and a  detailed conservation strategy has been published. Protected areas have  been specifically established for the species (Sonkhaliya-Sorson,  Lala-Naliya, Gaga-Bhatiya, Karera, Ghatigaon, Nannaj and Ranibennur), and  populations occur in some others (Desert National Park Sanctuary and Rollapadu  Wildlife Sanctuary). Desert National Park Sanctuary has now been proposed as a Biosphere Reserve by the Indian government (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Despite some failures (local extinctions in Sorson, Karera,&#160;Ghatigaon,&#160;Gaga-Bhatiya and Ranibennur), there have been some successes, and one female was recently seen in Sonkhaliya Lesser Florican area (D. Nandan <em>per. </em>P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).  Rehabilitation of grasslands has benefited the species in some  areas (particularly Desert National Park Sanctuary [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]). Grassland restoration through tree (<em>Gliricidia spp.</em>)<em>&#160;</em>removal has taken place at the GIB Sanctuary in Maharashtra (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016) and within six months Great Indian Bustards were seen in the area (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Tree removal&#160;is also planned for the Rollapadu Sanctuary (Anon. 2015).&#160;A programme of management to remove an invasive weed species,&#160;<em>Prosopis juliflora</em>, from&#160;grassland in Kachchh proved successful as within seven days, Great Indian Bustard was observed in the cleared area (Anon. 2014c).&#160;<br/><br/>The Indian government has provided financial support to  conservation actions for this species in some regions (Anon. 2009), and&#160;in association with several NGOs and experts has developed guidelines for State Action Plan for Resident Bustards’ recovery programme (Dutta <em>et.al.</em> 2013), as well as identifying key policies to protect grassland habitats (Anon. 2011a). 'Project Great Indian Bustard' has been launched in Rajasthan including  constructing breeding enclosures for the species and developing infrastructure to  reduce human pressure on habitats (Anon. 2013b). In Kachchh, a pilot programme has been established to neuter stray dogs around the core areas of the Bustard Sanctuary (Anon. 2014c). At the same time the dogs are vaccinated against rabies which will benefit the local community. Meetings and processions with local communities have been carried out in  the past by the Bombay Natural History Society (Rahmani 2006) to  generate support for birds among local people; and a&#160;procession was organised to establish a statue of Great Indian Bustard in a Hindu temple at Sankhala village in Rajasthan (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). More recently (March  2011), the Great Indian Bustard Foundation group held a two-day meeting with  communities within and around the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary at  Nannaj (Patil 2011). Nearly 600 villagers attended and discussions  covered the problems of local people and threats to the species (Patil  2011). School awareness programmes and large-scale community awareness programmes are also underway (e.g. Rahmani 1998, Sanctuary Asia 2016). Publicity materials and media stories have been produced to raise awareness of the species in India (Anon. 2015), and engagement activities with shepherd communities have aided in species monitoring and raising awareness (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>In August 2013 a three-year BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Programme/RSPB funded project was initiated with Bombay Natural History Society (Anon. 2014a), and a further project supported by the Whitely Fund for Nature (WFN) has also begun (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). A programme of research was set up to monitor the species and its grassland habitats (Anon. 2014a). In India, workshops on implementing conservation plans were held in four states with Great Indian Bustard populations, capacity-building workshops were also held for members of the local community, NGO and Government staff (Anon. 2015). A community awareness campaign was held in the Thar desert, Rajasthan between February and March 2014. Advocacy work under this project has helped to reduce community resentment against the species (including initiating a livestock health-check programme),&#160;and led to well-informed conservation planning, better coordination between different stakeholders, and mutual cooperation between different departments over conservation issues (Anon. 2014d, Anon. 2015).&#160;Community resentment may also be further reduced by making protected areas more targeted towards the habitats where the species occurs, as has been attempted in Maharashtra (Varghese <em>et al. </em>2016). Emergency conservation has been prepared for&#160;Rollapadu&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary, Andhra Pradesh, and for Karera and Ghatigaon GIB Sanctuaries in Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2014d).&#160;To clear confusions over land records and ownership related issues inside Desert National Park a new scientific map is being prepared (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Rajasthan State Forest Department has initiated a process of transferring land inside Desert National Park Sanctuary from State Revenue Department to State Forest Department, and the Rajasthan State Forest Department has secured more breeding habitat for species by increasing the number and size of closures across important breeding patches (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Additionally,&#160;the Rajasthan State Forest Department has banned construction of any new wind turbine in prime bustard landscape (e.g. in region of Jasialmer [G. Bharwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016]) without prior permission and clearance from the government, and predator-proof fences are being made to prevent the entry of free-ranging dogs, pigs, foxes, and monitor lizards into Great Indian Bustard breeding areas (G. Bharwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016, P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Planting of plant species other than local grasses has been discouraged in prime habitat by Rajasthan Forest Department and waterholes are being strictly maintained with a constant supply of water (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Camera traps have been installed at waterholes to monitor threats and species movement (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;BNHS has initiated an advocacy with Indian Army in order to monitor and protect individuals inside army managed restricted areas (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). A protected area for the species has been reportedly proposed by NGOs in Pakistan (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>The PEP and WFN projects have also supported local communties. The measures involved include developing the community network to monitor the species and its threats and supporting ecosystem-based livelihood practices. For instance, the&#160;Rajasthan State Forest Department (in collaboration with BNHS) has initiated livelihood leverage for women near Desert National Park through the setting up of local craft businesses, and have&#160;involved local community Eco-Development Committees (EDC) into conservation actions benefiting people (Anon 2016). These programmes have also directly supported local livelihood through efforts such as the ‘Local Community Nature Guide Program’ at Desert National Park Sanctuary (Anon 2014d, Anon 2015, Anon 2016); and&#160;BNHS in collaboration with Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) and Rajasthan State Forest Department have organised field training on the prevention of wildlife crime with special reference to Great Indian Bustard for ground level staff of State Forest Department Staff in Jaisalmer (Anon 2016).&#160;More guards have also been recruited to help protect the Great Indian Bustard in Desert National Park Sanctuary, and the local youth have been engaged in monitoring and patrolling by the State Forest Department (Anon 2016).&#160;Additionally, a capacity building programme was organised on Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act for State Forest Department Officers in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>Threats such as large powerlines and wind turbines have been mapped over prime habitat (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016), and considering the threat of disturbance from wildlife photographers during breeding season, photography of Great Indian Bustard has been banned in Gujarat and has been discouraged elsewhere in India (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). The Government of India (Wildlife Institute of India) in collaboration with Rajasthan State Forest Department has also proposed an ex-situ conservation project in Rajasthan (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><strong><br/></strong><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>A vast array of conservation actions have been proposed for this species, from a range of sources (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India have set up a Task Force to guide field implementation of bustard conservation actions. The Government of India has published guidelines for the state action plan for resident bustards’ recovery programme through meetings and workshops involving many parties (officials, experts, local people) (Dutta <em>et al.</em> 2013). Rajasthan State Government has set up a sub-committee on rationalisation of boundaries of Desert National Park Sanctuary (Upadhyay <em>et al.</em> 2015) and put forward measures through&#160;‘Project Great Indian Bustard’; and&#160;IUCN Bustards Specialists Group along with Bombay Natural History Society and Rajasthan State Forest Department has published a 30 points action plan for saving Great Indian Bustard in Thar Desert, Rajasthan (Collar <em>et al. </em>2015). Broadly speaking, the proposed conservation actions are:&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>1) To consolidate core breeding areas identified across the species’s range by creating strict refuges during prime breeding months (March–September). This will require acquiring government lands that are not owned by Forest Departments; making all core areas inviolate by chain-link-fencing and patrolling guards; and removing nest predators therein. It has also been proposed that&#160;southernmost part of Desert National Park Sanctuary should be de-notified as it is highly degraded because of agriculture, pockets of grasslands should be developed by handing over revenue lands to Forest Department, privately owned areas and tourist zones such as Sam sand dunes could be excluded from protected area boundaries.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>2) To formulate landscape conservation strategies in priority areas (informed by telemetry research). Evidence-based habitat management interventions should be planned and implemented (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012) including work to exclude any road construction activities and tall shrub/tree plantations as well as limiting grazing regimes. Infrastructure developments (roads, electricity network and wind turbines) known to have a negative effect on the species should be curtailed or minimised near core breeding areas, replaced by bustard-friendly alternatives (underground electric cables and passes), or have bird flight diverters attached. These actions can be achieved by declaring priority areas as community or conservation reserves or Eco-sensitive zones through legislation.&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>3) Community outreach. Local livelihoods should be linked with bustard conservation in priority areas by subsidy/incentive driven agro-environmental schemes that promote bustard-friendly farming practices, such as pesticide-free farming of short palatable crops separated by long fallow periods, and stall feeding of livestock during peak monsoon months. Community outreach to reduce resentment to the species should also be attempted, including providing facilities and services (e.g. local health care) (Anon 2011b, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Establish a&#160;‘Conservation Reserve’ or ‘Community Reserve’ under Indian law, with a view to financing, retaining and promoting traditional agriculture throughout, aiming at organic and fence-free farming with sustainable livestock levels.&#160;In association with NGO-Tiger Watch and Bombay Natural History Society, Rajasthan State Forest Department has also planned a ‘Great Indian Bustard Village Guardian Programme’.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>4) Provide more support and equipment to park staff, to better protect areas; and&#160;establish a volunteer warden programme modeled on those operating in tiger reserves elsewhere in India, to monitor and patrol areas as directed by park/police staff; potentially in conjunction with the army.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>5) Consider commencing an <em>ex situ</em> conservation breeding programme as an insurance against extinction. Since <em>in situ</em> conservation measures will require at least 5-10 years to be implemented and the rapidly declining population trend provides a window of &lt;5 years for procuring eggs from the wild, the implementation of a conservation breeding programme would have to be taken up urgently. However, this is not an alternative to effective habitat management, and is only a mechanism to repopulate extinction-prone small stocks after their habitats have been restored. Importantly, a recent study modelled the species's population dynamics and found that establishing effective <em>in situ</em> conservation measures within the next 10 years and not removing eggs from the wild would recruit more adult females to the wild population within 30 years than a programme of captive breeding and releases (Dolman <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span

This decline is projected to increase in the near future as a result of the loss and degradation of lowland forest and wetlands, and through direct exploitation and disturbance.<p></p> <p></p>","It is primarily recorded from small or large rivers, usually with sand or gravel bars, often within or adjacent to subtropical/tropical broadleaved forest, from the lowlands up to at least 1,500 m, and marshes/lakes near wet grasslands (Choudhury 2000, A. W. Tordoff <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. It is generally solitary but may aggregate into small flocks and family groups during winter (D. Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2006,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><strong> </strong>Pradhan<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>2007) and tends to frequent inaccessible and undisturbed areas. The species is known to breed and roost in Chir pine forest<strong>&#160;</strong>(A. W. Tordoff <em>in litt</em>. 2006, D. Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2006), and may also nest in&#160;<em>Terminalia myriocarpa</em><em>&#160;</em>(G. Maheswaran <em>in litt. </em>2016). Four nests located in Bhutan in 2003-2007 were solitary and located in large Chir pines on ridges or steep slopes at 500-1,500 m, near the confluence of a small forest stream with a larger river (Pradhan 2007, Pradhan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Nesting took place in March-early June, and individuals then moved up to 30 km to feed on sand bars in large braided river systems in winter (Pradhan 2007, Pradhan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). <p></p>","The main threats are presumed to be widespread loss, degradation and disturbance of forest and wetlands. The species is also very sensitive to human disturbance, for example it took 48 hours for a pair to return to their breeding site following a disturbance (Mondal and Maheswaran 2014). Wetlands have become degraded as a result of pollution, rapid growth of aquatic vegetation, and the over-exploitation of resources. Increasing disturbance and habitat degradation from settlement, conversion to agriculture, harvesting of wetland resources and, more locally, poaching are thought to present significant threats in key protected areas (e.g. Namdapha National Park) in north-east India, Bhutan and Myanmar (W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Natural forest fires have destroyed nests in Bhutan. In Bhutan, hydroelectric dam developments as well as road improvements have resulted in significant habitat degradation, and can affect heron populations (Price and Goodman 2015). Rivers act as busy transport routes for the human population, exacerbating disturbance of this specie<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>s (W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2006, D. Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2006).   <p></p>","Though a complete population census is yet to be conducted, the current population size is thought to be best placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals (D. Wilson and J. Eames <em>in litt.</em> 2006). &#160;This equates to 75-374 individuals in total, rounded here to 70-400 individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Ardea insignis</em> is known from the eastern Himalayan foothills in <strong>Bhutan</strong> and north-east <strong>India</strong> to the hills of <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, north <strong>Myanmar</strong> and, historically at least, across west and central Myanmar  (BirdLife International 2001). The first confirmed record of this species in China was made in 2014 in Lushui County, Yunnan Province on the border with Myanmar (S. Chan <em>in litt</em>. 2014). It may also occur in south-east Tibet, China, but is now extinct in Nepal. Birds may visit the Brahmaputra lowlands in winter. Although historical reports suggest it was previously common in Myanmar, it has evidently declined throughout its range given the paucity of recent records. Most of the few recent records come from sites in Assam and&#160;Namdapaha in&#160;Arunachal Pradesh, India (Maheswaran 2007, A. Choudhury <em>in litt. </em>2016), a few sites in Bhutan, and parts of Myanmar. In Bhutan, there is a small population of 30 known individuals (with six juveniles) as of July 2007 (Pradhan 2007), with the total national population unlikely to exceed 50 individuals (Pradhan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The birds were observed along the Phochu, confluence of Phochu-Mochu, Punatsangchhu, Kamechu (Digchu), Zawa, Ngagshina and Burichu confluence (Pradhan 2007), with another recent sighting along the Drangmechhu River (Wangdi <em>et al. </em>2017). Six active nests were recorded in Bhutan in 2007, two from a new site, and by 26 July 2007 they held six chicks in total. Due to natural forest fires, three nests were abandoned. &#160;A further three active nests with five chicks were recorded in 2009, although only three chicks remained on a subsequent visit (Anon 2009)<strong></strong>. Six breeding sites from two rivers of central Bhutan have been recorded, and the eastern part of the country has not been thoroughly surveyed (Pradhan <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>2007)<strong></strong>. The species has also been reported from the Thim Chhu, Lungtenphu (C. Feijen<em> in litt</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>. A massive hydroelectric scheme may have recently caused its expiration from the Sunkosh Valley (K. D. Bishop <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Two adult birds were recorded in Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, Sarpang in February 2014 (Anon. 2014). The annual survey of White-bellied Heron in Bhutan reported 22 birds in 2014, an increase from 2013 when 20 birds were recorded (Anon. 2014).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, the 21,700 km<sup>2</sup> Hukaung Valley tiger reserve (the largest area of suitable habitat within the species's range) is believed to support approximately 26-28 individuals (Price and Goodman 2015)<strong></strong>, and Hpon Razi Wildlife Sanctuary and Hkakabo Razi National Park hold small populations. White-bellied Heron has been recorded along rivers elsewhere in Kachin State, such as the Nam Sam Chaung, although little is known about its status in these areas<strong> </strong>(A. W. Tordoff <em>in litt</em>. 2006). Despite an increase in survey effort within the species's range in Myanmar there has been no corresponding increase in the number of records and the species was apparently absent from large areas of suitable habitat (J. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2006, D. Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. One recent repeat survey failed to record the species in an area where it had been seen in 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(D. Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. The findings of field surveys have also been supported by reports from local people which suggest that the species has declined in the region in recent years<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(D. Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. This evidence suggests there may be fewer than 250 individuals remaining<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(J. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2006, D. Wilson<em></em> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006)<strong></strong>. In north-east India, a few individuals are regularly seen in Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh (Maheswaran 2007). Up to six individuals were recorded in Namdapha Tiger Reserve in January 2014, this was followed by a breeding pair at the same location in March 2014, a first for India (Mondal and Maheswaran 2014). The nest observers had to leave the area before they were able to confirm whether the pair had successfully raised a brood, however a second visit was planned for July-August 2014. Further nest building was noted at this site in 2015, though nesting appeared to fail following a storm (G. Maheswaran <em>in litt. </em>2016). Records from other sites are sporadic and there are no recent sightings from a number of former sites including Jamjing Reserved Forest, Dibru-Saikhowa National Park,&#160;Kaziranga National Park, Nameri National Park&#160;and Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Choudhury <em>in litt. </em>2012. 2016).

A área tem sido amostrada desde a descrição da espécie, em 2001, porém sem novos registros. Todas as localidades de registro da espécie estão acima da UHE Serra da Mesa, restando poucos trechos fora de sua área de inundação. A localidade-tipo da espécie, no córrego Bateias, atualmente está inundada pela represa da UHE. A área de ocupação registrada e estimada de <em>A. minutus</em>, onde a espécie ainda pode ser encontrada, assumindo extinções locais na área de inundação da hidrelétrica, é de 310 km<sup>2</sup>. Considerando como principal ameaça atual incidente sobre a espécie os impactos causados pela construção da UHE Serra da Mesa, foram definidas no máximo quatro localizações: trechos do rio Traíras, córrego Acaba Vida, córrego Acaba Saco e córrego Bateias. Além disso, <em>A. minutus</em> sofre com ameaças difusas como a degradação ambiental, a agropecuária e a urbanização. Portanto, indica-se um declínio continuado na área de ocupação, extensão de ocorrência e qualidade do habitat da espécie. Desta forma, <em>Ancistrus minutus</em> foi categorizada como Em Perigo (EN).","<em>Ancistrus minutus</em> é a espécie do gênero <em>Ancistrus </em>que alcança menor porte, chegando ao comprimento corporal total de 5,7 cm (Fisch-Muller 2003).

It appears from recent counts that the population is now stable, probably as a result of extensive conservation actions. If evidence continues to show that the population remains stable, the species may be downlisted to a lower category of threat in the future.<br/><p></p> <p></p>","During the breeding season, the species inhabits basaltic lakes in the arid Patagonian steppes at elevations of 500-1,200 m<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Chebez 1994); saline and bitter-salt lakes are used by non-breeding flocks and at least some birds wintering on the Argentinian coast (Johnson and Serret 1994). Aquatic vegetation (mainly <em>Myriophyllum elatinoides</em>) on the breeding lakes is essential material for floating nests and as habitat for several aquatic invertebrates that form its basic diet<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Chebez 1994). During the first week after hatching, chicks are fed with aquatic beetles (<em>Limnaea </em>spp.)<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994). The species breeds in colonies of up to 130 pairs from October to March<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994), but has an exceedingly low reproductive rate with an average of 0.2 young reared per adult per year (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). However, while potential resources for breeding are apparently limited, the resources for adult survival appear to be plentiful, and under natural circumstances adult mortality may be extremely low (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). It occasionally establishes colonies in areas marginal to its main range (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). Individuals tend to have a high fidelity towards the plateaus where they were born (Roesler <em>et al.</em> 2016).<p></p>","The principal threats to the species appear to be introduced American Mink <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neovison vison,&#160;</span>salmon and trout and climate change (S. Imberti <em>in litt.</em> 1999,&#160;Imberti and Casañas 2010,&#160;Casañas<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2013, Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/>American Mink threaten the species at all stages of its life, with nests, chicks and adults all vulnerable to predation (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Fasola and Roesler 2018). In 2010-2011, an American Mink<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span> killed more than half the adults in a breeding colony of two dozen nests on the Buenos Aires plateau (Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a). Further losses to lone mink occurred in 2012-2013, with 15 adults and 7 juveniles killed at El Cervecero and 10 adults and 5 chicks killed at the very remote C199 colony in La Siberia plateau (<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>Casañas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Given that the Buenos Aires plateau currently holds a large proportion of the population, the presence of American Mink is a serious threat (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Furthermore, American Mink are known to exhibit 'surplus killing', which means that the presence of a single animal could result in the loss of whole grebe colonies (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Efforts to eradicate American Mink are complicated by its dispersal behaviour, with young males dispersing widely and re-occupying lakes (Fasola and Roesler 2018).<br/><br/>Recently, the introduction of trout has been correlated with a decline in breeding numbers at certain lakes (S. Imberti&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006,&#160;Konter 2008)<strong></strong>. These exotic salmonids compete for food with the Hooded Grebe and modify lake conditions, increasing levels of cyanobacteria which may be harmful to grebes (Lancelotti<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Izaguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Francisco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>Surveys between 2006 and 2013 found a number of lakes completely dry, and water levels at known breeding sites were 2-3 m lower than in previous years<strong></strong>&#160;(Konter 2008, Imberti and Casañas 2010, Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a, Casañas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Anecdotal reports indicated reduced winter snowfall without a corresponding increase in precipitation at other times<strong></strong>&#160;(Konter 2008). Research has indicated that lower water levels exacerbate the detrimental impact of introduced fish on the lake conditions and thus on the grebes (Izaguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Given the small size of the population, the failure of an entire colony's breeding effort due to exceptionally high winds, as observed in 2013 at La Siberia, is another potentially serious threat (Casañas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The apparent increase in the incidents of these exceptional winds over the last two decades (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) may be related to overgrazing and/or climate change (Imberti and Casañas 2010).<br/><br/>Excessive grazing by sheep (which causes erosion at lakeshores and limits the growth of emergent vegetation), predation by Kelp Gulls <em>Larus dominicanus</em> at some lakes and attacks by Flying Steamerducks <em>Tachyeres patachonicus</em>&#160;(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997, Imberti and Casañas 2010, Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). The population may be limited by the carrying capacity of rather few lakes with good nest vegetation (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). Volcanic eruptions in the breeding area may have a negative short-term effect because of heavy ash fall, but a long-term positive effect on the productivity of the wetlands (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). There is oil exploitation on the potential migration route to the Atlantic<strong></strong>&#160;(S. Imberti&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999). Light pollution from cities, as well as oil exploitation and mining, may pose a threat on migration routes (Roesler <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Poor habitat conditions in breeding lakes may have increased competition for nest sites with other waterfowl species (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015). By-catch from fisheries may pose a threat in the winter range (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2016b). The planned construction of two hydroelectric dams on the Santa Cruz River may cause changes to the species's wintering habitats and food availability, thereby threatening the species's wintering areas (Aves Argentinas 2016, Roesler <em>et al. </em>2018a). Research has indicated that although the species winters at three estuaries, before returning to their breeding grounds they congregate at the Santa Cruz-Chico estuary, with almost 95% of the total population recorded there in August 2016 (Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a), meaning that any impact of dams on this estuary could have a great impact on the population.","In 2013, a simultaneous count across all plateaus known to have ever held grebes and visiting virtually every lake with historic records of the species, resulted in a count of 691 adults and 144 chicks in 12 colonies (Casañas<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). During the summer of 2014/2015, 771 adults, 138 juveniles and 12 colonies were recorded across 18 lakes (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys during the breeding season in 2015/2016,&#160;&#160;2016/17&#160;and 2017/18&#160;counted 753, 749 and 776 adults, respectively (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b, 2017, 2018b). The total population is therefore estimated at 650-800 mature individuals.",Stable,"This species&#160;breeds on a few basaltic lakes in the interior of Santa Cruz, extreme south-west <strong>Argentina</strong>. The only known wintering grounds are located at the estuaries of río Coyle, río Gallegos and río Chico on the Atlantic coast of Santa Cruz (Johnson and Serret 1994<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>,<strong> </strong>Imberti <em>et al</em>. 2004, Roesler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011b)<strong></strong>. It is apparently a summer visitor in the Torres del Paine National Park in Magallanes, southern&#160;<strong>Chile</strong>, but there are no confirmed breeding records for the country (Roesler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011b, S. Saiter and F. Schmitt <em>in litt</em>. 2013, Donoso <em>et al.</em> 2015, Roesler 2015). The total population was estimated at 3,000-5,000 individuals in the mid-1980s, with half of these on Meseta de Strobel (Fjeldså 1984, O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). Counts on the wintering grounds suggest a decline of 40% over a period of seven years (S. Imberti <em>in litt</em>. 2006). Surveys conducted in December 2006 and January 2009, which revisited key known breeding sites surveyed in 1987 (Lagunas del Sello, del Islote and Tolderia Grande) and 1998 (Encadenadas), also found sharp declines; numbers fell from 452 to 51 at Laguna del Sello, from 700 to 0 at Laguna del Islote, from 90 to 0 at Tolderia Grande<strong></strong> (H. Casañas <em>in litt</em>. 2009) and from 198 to 0 at Lagunas Encadenadas<strong></strong> (Konter 2008). While there is speculation that numbers fluctuate dramatically at breeding sites from year to year driven by movements rather than actual population fluctuations (Fjeldså 1986), overall declines detected on the wintering and breeding grounds appear to have been real and rapid (Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011b). In both the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 breeding seasons, the species was most abundant on three plateaus: Buenos Aires, Strobel and Siberia,&#160;with five lakes holding almost 85% of the population (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Comparing the total counts made across the same 58 lagoons in 1984-5 (2,352 individuals) and 2010-11 (471 individuals) suggests an overall population reduction of 80% over 26 years, most of which occurred in the Strobel plateau (Roesler <em>et al. </em>2012, Roesler 2016). In 2013, greater resources allowed a simultaneous count across all plateaus known to have ever held grebes and visiting virtually every lake with historic records of the species, resulting in a count of 691 adults and 144 chicks in 12 colonies (Casañas<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). During the summer of 2014/2015, 771 adults, 138 juveniles and 12 colonies were recorded across 18 lakes (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Three new lakes holding the species were identified; however, on the Strobel plateau the number of lakes holding the species decreased. Surveys during the breeding season in 2015/2016,&#160;&#160;2016/17&#160;and 2017/18&#160;counted 753, 749 and 776 adults, respectively&#160; (Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b, 2017, 2018b).&#160;<p></p>",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Aves Argentinas is Species Guardian for Hooded Grebe and, along with the local NGO Ambiente Sur, is coordinating the conservation effort. Patagonia National Park was created in 2014, covering 52,000 ha that includes over half of the breeding colonies&#160;(Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015). The site where the species was discovered in 1974, Laguna Los Escarchados, was declared a reserve in 1979, but is now known to hold only a marginal population (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Comprehensive surveys have taken place to locate all breeding colonies with ongoing monitoring to assess breeding success and mortality. Surveys of the breeding population have taken place annually since 2009 (Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b). Surveys of wintering birds have been carried out along estuaries of the Atlantic coast (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2018b). Research on the species's migration routes is underway, with the use of colour rings and GPS transmitters (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, 2018b). Blood samples have been taken to perform genetic analyses and stable isotope analysis to better understand the species's diet.<br/>'Colony  Guardians' have been established with local communities  (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2016a). These  are local people assigned to protect nests from predators, and to  collect breeding data. Their efforts have improved survival rates at a  number of colonies; recruitment is significantly enhanced at nests with Colony Guardians  (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2016a). An awareness-raising program has included displays and theatre productions within the region and the production of a video highlighting the plight of the species, which has been presented to over 100,000 people. An interpretation centre has been established at Río Gallegos, an important wintering area for the species (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Workshops have been held in 2014 and 2016 to provide updates on conservation work and engage with the scientific community (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b). Members of the Hooded Grebe Project have met with fishing, environmental and conservation agencies in Santa Cruz to inform them of key sites for the species to support decision-making (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). In August 2015, a 'Hooded grebe month' took place, involving&#160;educational, recreational, cultural and artistic activities (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b). Teachers have been trained about the species's biology and threats (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b).<br/><br/>A monitoring protocol and control program for invasive species has been devised, targeting American Mink, Kelp Gulls (Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2013) and salmonid populations at breeding lakes and identifying routes of arrival. Work is ongoing to eradicate American Mink from the high plateau areas (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>, </em>2016b). In 2014/2015, 40% fewer mink were captured compared to 2013/2014 indicating that these control measures were proving to be effective. A regulation has been passed banning the introduction of trout on the Buenos Aires plateau and a large number of trout have been removed from Laguna El Islote (Casañas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a). In 2015, Kelp Gull were controlled on the Buenos Aires plateau by shaking eggs to reduce breeding success (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;<br/><br/>&#160;A captive rearing programme has been initiated near the Strobel Lake population, with the aim of raising wild eggs in captivity and releasing them back to Strobel Lake in order to boost the population (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015), although by 2018 no captive-reared chicks had so far been released (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2018a).<br/><br/>Experiments to prevent the loss of colonies to wave action during exceptionally strong winds have been undertaken, but were halted due to the risk posed to the grebes (Casañas <em>et al.</em> 2013, Roesler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018a).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Continue comprehensive surveys of breeding colonies and winter censuses of estuaries and unfrozen lakes.

The species continues to be impacted by habitat degradation, principally this is increased turbidity of water resulting from sedimentation flows from upstream deforestation (for instance in Nagaland, India) (K.

Therefore, it is listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","The species breeds in steep and extremely rugged terrain at 160-1,200 m. It usually nests in burrows associated with the root structure of trees, including Ohia lehua (<em>Metrosideros polymorpha</em>) and a dominant understory of densely matted uluhe fern (<em>Dicranopteris linearis</em>) in montane mesic forests on steep slopes (<strong></strong>Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007). In general, it can nest in any habitat that is free of predators (Troy <em>et al. </em>2016, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>The breeding season begins in April, when birds return to prospect for nest sites and, following an exodus in late April, egg-laying in early June is highly synchronised (NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Pairs produce one egg, which is incubated for an average of 53-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 81-94 days (NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Most young fledge by November (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The age at first breeding is around six or seven years (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The species's diet is not well known, although it likely consists of fish and squid,&#160;particularly flyingfish and Purpleback Flying Squid (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ainley <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong></strong>. It forages for hundreds of kilometres offshore, often in large, mixed species flocks associated with schools of large, predatory fish that drive prey species to the ocean surface (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>","<p>The main threat to this species is thought to be predation by non-native species (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 1999, Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005, NSWG 2005). Predation of adults and juveniles by feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> and Barn Owls <em>Tyto alba</em> has been documented on almost every colony on Kaua'i, including the most remote sites (NSWG 2005, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans</em>, Black Rats <em>R. rattus</em>, Brown Rats <em>R. rattus</em> and House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> were inadvertently introduced to the Hawaiian islands as a result of human activity and shipwrecks (Duffy 2010) and may depredate eggs and chicks (NSWG 2005). Brown Rats appear to be more associated with human settlement and do not appear to be as severe a threat as the other two introduced rat species (Raine <em>et al</em>. 2017). Another potential predator, the Small Indian Mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, has recently been discovered on Kaua'i (NSWG 2005), and could potentially be a greater threat than cats as its smaller size means it may be able to enter breeding burrows more easily (Duffy and Capece 2014). It is yet to establish a permanent presence on the island (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2016), although it has a history of incursions onto Kaua'i and one was trapped there in 2016 (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt</em>. 2016). When the Two-spotted Leafhopper <em>Sophonia rufofascia</em> first established on the Hawaiian Islands, it led to habitat loss through feeding on the Uluhe Fern D<em>icranopteris linearis</em> which provide cover for shearwater burrows (Cooper and Day 1998). The leafhopper was a cause for great concern not only for shearwaters, but also for agricultural crops and native flora; hence a biological control programme was initiated and the insect is now hard to find on Hawai'i (Coll and Wajnberg 2017). Dogs have been shot at Ka'ena Point, while attacking nestling albatrosses and shearwaters (Duffy 2010), but the scale of their impact is unknown. Habitat loss due to conversion and introduction of herbivores like domesticated goats and pigs pose another threat on the Hawaiian Islands (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2012), and have been suggested as a contributing factor for the recent abandonment of some colonies (Troy and Holmes 2008, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>On Kaua'i, hurricanes Iwa and Iniki devastated the forests in 1982 and 1992, dramatically reducing available nesting habitat and reducing breeding attempts for Newell’s Shearwaters (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Given that a large proportion of the population breeds on Kaua'i, catastrophic events, like hurricanes, represent a serious threat (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>During the 1980s and 1990s an estimated 70 adults and 280 subadults each summer, and at least 340 fledglings each autumn, died as a result of collisions with power-lines and communications towers, or indirectly because of light attraction (Podolsky <em>et al.</em> 1998, Anon. 2007). In the surveyed areas on eastern and southern Kaua'i, 350 adults are reported dead each year from collisions with power lines (Podolsky <em>et al.</em> 1998). Fledglings on their first flight to the ocean are particularly susceptible to attraction to artificial light. The birds are attracted and disoriented by coastal street lights and once grounded, unable to fly and often killed by cars, cats or dogs, or die from starvation or dehydration (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005). Between 1978 and 1981, more than 5,000 individuals were grounded on Kaua'i, and more than 30,000 have been found as victims of fallout since 1971 (Anon. 2007, Griesemer and Holmes 2011). Intense rescue programmes have been initiated to find grounded birds and return them to the sea (Everett and Pitman 1993). On Kaua'i, approximately 1,500 fledglings are recovered annually after becoming grounded (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005), although with the suspected steep population decline on Kaua'i, the number of grounded birds is expected to have decreased proportionately (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Collision with artificial structures (such as powerlines and wind turbines) is another key threat to the species, particularly in flight corridors for subadult and adult birds accessing inland colonies. Nine communications towers have recently been constructed on the Hawaiian Islands without proper consultation, and these are now the subject of an ongoing lawsuit (Anon. 2007). A field of wind generators was planned for Kaua'i and Lana'i (Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 2009 <em>in</em> Duffy 2010), without accounting for the potential impacts on this species. Although wind farms have been shown to have only minor effects on other bird species elsewhere, night-flying Shearwaters may be particularly vulnerable and the cumulative effects of construction and maintenance, erosion, vegetation clearing and noise should be accounted for (Duffy 2010). It is not confirmed whether the wind farm projects will be realised (T. Holmes <em>in litt</em>. 2007, A. Raine <em>in litt.</em> 2016).</p>  <p>Plastic pollution poses yet another threat. On Kaua'i, 50% of Newell’s Shearwater fledglings necropsied during 2007–2014 contained plastic items in their digestive tract and there is evidence that the mass and the number of items ingested per bird have also increased since the 1980s (Kain <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is thought that consumption of even small quantities of plastic, including fibres and small fragments, exposes birds at all stages of the breeding cycle to plastic-associated co-pollutants and associated impacts survival (Kain <em>et a</em>l. 2016).</p>  On Hawai'i, cinder mining has resulted in habitat loss at several colonies (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1983 <em>in</em> Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997, Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005) and together with other causes of habitat degradation (invasive vegetation, agriculture and urbanisation) contributes to the exposure and increased predation of ground-nesting birds (Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997). The species is also likely to be impacted by the commercial fishery through bycatch and indirect ecosystem effects resulting from overfishing of tuna <em>Tunnus</em> spp. (Mitchell <em>et al. </em>2005, Waugh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<p></p>","There have been several population size estimates for this species (see  Griesemer and Holmes 2011), but the most recent gives a minimum  population estimate of 27,011 individuals (Joyce 2016), which roughly equates to 18,000 mature individuals. However, given the decline on Kauai and near extirpation from Maui, the population size could now be far smaller (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016). The population size is therefore precautionarily placed in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Puffinus newelli</em> nests principally on the mountains of Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>). Small colonies exist on Moloka'i, Hawai`i and possibly Maui, with unconfirmed records from Lana`i. After not having been recorded on Oahu since the 1700s, a survey carried out in 2016-2017 located the species in two sites at Mount Kaala and at Poamoho, suggesting that it regularly visits or even breeds on the island (Young <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In the late 1970s, a cross-fostering experiment was carried out at Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge (Kaua'i), in which 90 eggs were placed in nests of the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (<em>A</em><em>rdenna pacifica</em>) (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. Subsequently, 30 young were fledged. Four breeding pairs nesting in 2006 were believed to be descendents of fostered birds (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. Between 2006 and 2013, colony calls were played at the Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge and artificial burrows constructed to attract nesting pairs, as there is a low threat from alien predators or collisions with artificial structures (Anon. 2007). Subsequently, up to 13 pairs have been recorded there (N. Holmes and A. Raine&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. After the construction of a predator-proof fence in 2015 within the Refuge, 8 chicks were translocated to the site from montane colonies and were raised to fledging (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is planned to translocate up to 50 chicks to the Refuge over a five year period (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Also since 2015, social attraction has also been employed in an attempt to save the population on Maui. While the results are looking favourable, it is too soon to evaluate success (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>In total, predator control and monitoring activities are in place at six colonies on Kaua'i, which involve the control of cats, rats, pigs and Barn Owls as well as monitoring the effectiveness of these activities through the use of cameras and acoustic monitoring devices (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). On Kauai', Barn Owl control is also carried out at another five colonies located along the Na Pali coast, Kalaheo/Kahili and Hanalei valley (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). The effectiveness of Barn Owl control is being monitored through the deployment of acoustic recording devices via helicopter in management areas (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>There is an active programme to control lights across Kaua'i. Building's lighting has been effectively re-designed to reduce collisions (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006 under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has enforced a campaign, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua`i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. In the course of the campaign, also street lights are darkened or turned off by the island's electricity company.&#160;<br/><br/>Moreover, the electricity company of Kaua'i has started incorporating a range of  measures to reduce powerline collisions, including moving lines  underground, lowering them, fitting diverters and testing a ‘laser  fence’ on key lines to make them more visible to birds moving at night  (Griesmer and Holmes 2011, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Several lawsuits have already been brought forward for violations under the Endangered Species Act (Harrison 2009), including against a hotel which was responsible for over one quarter of all birds downed as a result of light pollution. However, there is still a considerable amount of infrastructure that needs to be modified. It is not expected that the threat posed by artificial lighting will ever be completely eliminated (N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Yet overall, significant improvements have been made to reduce light attraction and collision (N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>.  Over 30,000 downed birds have been rescued and released through the  Save Our Shearwaters programme since 1979 (Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017),  although few of  these birds have subsequently been found again (NSWG 2005, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016). <p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Enforce regulatory compliance to minimize light attraction (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Continue predator control in remaining populations in north-west Kaua'i (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Establish predator-free colonies through fencing, trapping of predators, and use social attraction to entice shearwaters to nest within (Griesemer and Holmes 2011, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016). Continue to use radar observations to monitor population trends and develop methods to monitor breeding success (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Conduct long-term demographic studies to measure the success of habitat and predator management (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Continue to retrieve grounded birds (N.

152845178,60344,Anguilla anguilla,Critically Endangered,A2bd+4bd,2020,2018-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> exhibits facultative catadromy (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000, Tesch 2003), has multiple life stages, and is semelparous (Tesch 2003) and is panmictic across a continental spatial scale (Als <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pujolar <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>b</em>); these life history traits and characteristics made application of the IUCN Red List criteria challenging. Anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk31280999"">The IUCN Red List criteria prioritise indices of mature animals at their breeding area. I</a>n the absence of such data for the eel, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of European Eels, leaving ‘continental’ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of (pre-) spawning stock biomass, but such data sets for migrating silver eel are low in number, spatially limited and only recent (most only since 2010). The index data best representing the geographic range of <em>A. anguilla</em><em>, </em>over adequate time scales to apply the Red List criteria<em>,</em><em> </em>relate to glass eels, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood (Westerberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). While there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock (e.g. Dekker, 2004, Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011), evidence is lacking to support such hypotheses and to deviate from the common view that the European Eel is a panmictic species, i.e. all individuals come from a single spawning stock. As such, escapement from a specific river/country/region will not be directly reflected in subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. Furthermore, it is most precautionary to assume that each and every part of the continental distribution area potentially contributes to the reproductive process, or that each part may be the key part (Dekker 1999). Therefore, the IUCN Red List criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the most comprehensive estimate.</p><p>Yellow and silver eel data for <em>A. anguilla </em>have an uneven geographical spread and do not fully represent the stock across its range. Nevertheless, a cursory analysis of these data found that over three generation lengths (39 years; see Habitat and Ecology), the mean decline in yellow and silver eels was found to be greater than 50% (see Population). Both analyses on yellow and silver eels indicated declines within the range of Endangered (EN) category. <a name=""_Hlk26366036""></a></p><p>Compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, are strong correlations between recruit series from sites over the range showing substantial declines during the period of the last three generations (Bornarel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The ICES recruitment index is 98.6% lower in the ‘North Sea’ series, and 94% lower in the ‘Elsewhere’ series, compared to the 1960–1979 reference level (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). It is noted, however, that the most recent statistical analyses conducted on these recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, the numbers of silver eels may continue to decline, reflecting past declines in recruitment. </p><p>Sampling for leptocephali in the Sargasso Sea was undertaken in 2011, and results compared with previous sampling across the same area occurring in 1983 and 1985 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). The reduction in catch rate was 89% between 1983 and 2011, and 64% between 1985 and 2011 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation indicates a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding grounds over this time period, suggesting a lower abundance of spawners, higher egg and/or larval mortality and/or a reduction in spawning success. Thus, data on leptocephali and recruits to continental waters indicate declines within the range of Critically Endangered (CR). </p><p>A suite of threats have been implicated in the decline of European Eel recruitment and stock: barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines and pumps; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly&#160;<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>); exploitation of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation.&#160;The significance of these threats individually or synergistically may vary across spatial range of the eel. Further research is required to fully quantify and understand the complexities of individual and combined threats.</p><p>Eel Management Plans (EMPs) have been developed in European Union Member States after implementation of the EU Council Regulation No 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the European Eel (EU 2007). The Regulation set the objective of each EMP to be to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock” (EU 2007), and that EMPs would be prepared with the purpose of achieving this objective in the long term. </p><p>A number of management measures are being implemented in line with EMPs,&#160;including control of fisheries, bypassing turbines and pumps, easing of barriers and restocking - transfer of eel from one watershed to another. Quantifying the effects of these measures on silver eel escapement biomass is complicated in many cases because (i) measures are not implemented in isolation, making it difficult to identify individual contributions, and (ii) measures affecting earlier life stages will take years to influence silver eels, and ultimately spawning stock. There remains a great deal of debate as to whether restocking benefits the eel spawning stock and thus enhances future recruitment. Regulations and management actions currently focus on increasing escapement from continental waters, although these do not take account of eel condition or quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). &#160;&#160;</p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). It was concluded that the Regulation has been important in catalysing activity towards the recovery of the European Eel and remains a relevant document (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). However, despite progress, the eel remains in a critical condition and recovery could take decades, and further ambition is required (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>).</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2007,&#160;&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;was listed in Appendix II of CITES (the&#160;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#160;of Wild Fauna and Flora)&#160;due to concerns over the impact of international trade on this species (this listing came into force in March 2009).&#160;In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded it was not possible to perform a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF) for this species (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). Exports out of, and imports into, the European Union (EU), have since ceased due to ongoing concerns over the decline in recruitment and stocks. However, trade continues within the EU and from non-EU countries within its range to other non-EU countries. In 2014, <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> was also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).</p><p>The limited understanding of the complex relationship between recruitment, growth phase, and escapement makes it difficult to determine how declines in one will affect the other. However, it has been concluded that low recruitment will very likely ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at least one generation length (13 years; see Habitat and Ecology). Further, since there is a short time period (~two years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low breeding stock. As such it was deemed appropriate to assign&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;a Critically Endangered (CR) listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (A2bd+4bd).</p><p>This category status remains unchanged from the previous assessment. Ultimately the CR category accounts for a proportional decline in population over a continental scale and this species has undergone a substantial decline over the last three generations. Although implementation of management measures has shown improvement, there is still concern over the effectiveness of EMPs to generate recovery to historic reference state within an appropriate timeframe, in the context of multiple threats (European Commission 2020). Continued, and ideally increased, effort will be essential in promoting recovery. A drive to fill data gaps – particularly in relation to the southern range of this species – would allow a more spatially comprehensive assessment in the future. </p><p>                          </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters (ICES 2015). It also occupies open ocean areas during migrations but is rarely observed in this habitat. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea; it is stocked elsewhere.<br/> <br/> <strong>Ecology:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is facultatively catadromous, living in fresh, brackish and coastal waters but migrating to pelagic marine waters to breed (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000). While there is some understanding of the eel’s continental life history, relatively little is known about its marine phase. The migrations in the European Eel’s life cycle are the longest and most oceanographically complex of the Anguillid species (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2002). </p><p>There are no exact data about specific spawning sites, however, it is hypothesised that spawning takes place in an elliptic zone, about 2,000 km wide in the Sargasso Sea, in the West Central Atlantic (from 70° W and eastward to 50° W) (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2019). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). The adults are assumed to die after spawning (Tesch 2003). Oceanic migration of leptocephali is estimated to take about two years on average before they arrive at the continental shelf (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The mechanisms by which leptocephali reach the European and N. African coasts are not well understood. In the Atlantic region, recruitment has been found to follow a South to North gradient over a period of around four to five months (ICES 2020). This starts in September in the North-West and occurs progressively later in the Channel and North Sea (ICES 2020). Recruitment to the Mediterranean is slightly more complex, publications suggest most eel ascent occurs between December and March, and landings suggest a peak in January. Although in some areas, recruitment occur over a wider period, even year-round (ICES 2020). <br/> <br/> Glass eels enter freshwater as sexually undifferentiated individuals. Development and differentiation of the sexual organs are thought to be closely correlated with body size and associated with the yellowing phase of the life history. Sex determination is principally driven by environmental factors with density-dependence producing more males at high densities (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Male European eels initially grow faster than females, however, females achieve a greater age and size than males when sexually mature. Furthermore, the mean length increases significantly with latitude in females but not males, whereas age increases significantly in both (Durif <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Aprahamian unpub. data). Male fitness is maximised by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time minimising strategy) such that males tend to emigrate at a length of &lt;450 mm (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Conversely, females adopt a more flexible size-maximising strategy prior to migration that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity (Davey and Jellyman 2005). There is considerable geographic variation in mean length at metamorphosis of male and female European eels (Vøllestad 1992). Dekker <em>et al</em>. (1998) described the extreme sizes in each of the life stages of the European eel from data at a long-term capture locality in the Netherlands, this paper also discussed the international situation, finding no more extreme values (sizes (cm): Min–Max, glass eels: 5.4–9.2, yellow: 6.9–133.0, silver (Male): 21.2–44.4, Silver (Female): 26.4–101.0). Driven by density-dependence, there are often skewed sex ratios at individual localities as well as geographic bias associated with latitude.<br/> <br/> Eel growth increases with temperature, as documented in aquaculture (Sadler 1979, Dosoretz and Degani 1987, Holmgren 1996, Ciccotti and Fontenelle 2001), and growth rate is generally faster in saline water than fresh (Acou <em>et al</em>. 2003, Daverat and Tomas 2006, Cairns <em>et al</em>. 2009). Furthermore, those individuals produced in saline waters usually have significantly higher fat content and contain lower loads of the swim bladder parasite, <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> and thus may have improved chances of reaching their spawning grounds (ICES 2009, Marohn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Body burden of toxic compounds, that are thought to affect migration and reproductive success, are also variable over regions and river basins, dependent on local pollution pressure (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the growth phase, dependent on size, eels feed on a variety of organisms including fish, amphipods and decapod crustaceans. In saline muddy-bottomed habitats, eels forage on bivalves, shrimp, small fish and polychaete worms. The tendency towards piscivory has been linked to eel length: there is evidence that eels &gt;40 cm have the ability to consume larger prey such as fish or crustaceans (Moriarty 1974, Mann and Blackburn 1991, Yalçın-Özdilek and Solak 2007). Lammens <em>et al</em>. (1985) observed periods of low chironomid biomass to be a factor resulting in eels switching to prey on fish. In a comparison of two lakes in Germany, piscivory in eels was also concluded to be controlled by macrozoobenthos density (Dörner <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>      </p><p>The age at which eels undergo the transformation to the silver stage and undertake their spawning migration, is hugely variable and dependent on latitude and temperature of the environment in which they have grown, food availability, physical barriers that block migration routes, growth rate and sex differences. Estimates for average ranges of the continental growth phase were suggested as approximately 2–15 years for males and 4–20 years for females (Tesch 2003) – noting that much older individual eels occur especially in the latter. Durif <em>et al</em> (2009) examined a number of data sets from across the species range in relation to age at silvering which indicated a range of 2 to 15 years for males and 2 to 30 years for females. From these ranges, an estimated generation length of 13 years was used for this assessment, inclusive of a two-year larval migration and one-year spawning migration of silver eels (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has however been stated that there is variability in the accuracy of the methods used to age eels (ICES 2015). Assessment of available data on generation length during the IUCN Red List process highlighted that defining the required single generation length value for species with a broad range of ages-at-maturation such as eels was extremely difficult. Factors that can significantly affect this parameter include longitude and latitude, sex, growth rates, habitat quality and resource availability.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is susceptible to a number of natural and anthropogenic threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat loss/degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). The occurrence and significance of these threats varies considerably from area to area across the species range. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Dekker 2004, Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures (listed below), are less likely to have a significant positive effect on the stock than a combined approach. </p><p>There is a significant body of information including a great deal of contradiction in peer-reviewed and grey literature, and in expert opinion, relating to these threats. The assessment process and accompanying external review indicated that a comprehensive discussion of these threats and their impacts was significantly beyond the scope of this assessment.

In the AMBER (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers) project has begun tracking barriers across Europe, compiling them into a ‘Barrier Atlas’ to better inform management and conservation (AMBER International 2019). The project is ongoing, but so far around 415,000 barriers - complete or partial, with degree of obstruction not often fully quantified - have been recorded within this tool (AMBER International 2019). Relating in particular to hydropower, 21,387 plants are recorded currently in existence in Europe, with a further 278 under construction, and 8,507 planned (Schwarz <em>et al</em>. 2019).<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> In the Iberian Peninsula, 80% of eel habitat had been lost when compared to a 19<sup>th</sup> century baseline, as a result of dams causing fragmentation (Clavero and Hermoso 2015). A full life cycle model developed by Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggested the decline of the European Eel between 1975 and 1985 may be somewhat attributed to habitat loss. The model projected a reduction in suitable eel habitat, by 16% in the Mediterranean and 71% in the North and Baltic seas (Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. 2015). Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial use (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). For example, Portugal, Spain and Morocco have been impacted by dam construction and/or drought in recent decades (Kettle <em>et al.</em> 2011). Further, it has been hypothesised, that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this species’, particularly the female’s, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success (van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000).</p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in <em>A. anguilla</em> – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding area (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p><p>The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American Eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif <em>et al</em>. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to larval metamorphosis being impeded due to the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Miller and Tsukamoto 2016). <a name=""_Hlk13652216"">Using a high-resolution ocean model, Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. (2014) found ocean current variations to be a major driver in the onset of decline in European Eel recruitment that occurred in the early 1980s. Although after this period, the correlation between oceanic fluctuations and eel recruitment was lost, and lack of recovery was likely a result of other pressures (Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. 2014). </a>Pacariz <em>et al</em>. (2014), however, found that the overall success of larval drift from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958–2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson <em>et al</em>. (2012). Politis <em>et al</em>. (2017) found 18°C to be optimum temperature for spawning of <em>A. anguilla</em> under experimental conditions. The results suggested <em>A. anguilla</em> may inhabit a deeper layer of the Sargasso Sea during early life stages and may be vulnerable to changes in temperature as a result of ocean warming. A recent ICES WGEEL report described climate change and increasing ocean temperature under “new and emerging threats”, due to unusually warm and dry periods occurring throughout European countries (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). This warm and dry period resulted in higher water temperatures, reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, and in some cases habitat loss through drought, creating stressful conditions for eels and other freshwater biota (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). There were several reports of eel mortalities from European countries, connected to warmer water, increased instances of disease, or deaths that could not be explained (ICES2018<em>c</em>).</p><p>The parasite nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>), introduced when the Japanese Eel (<em>A. japonica</em>) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach its spawning ground. There multiple proposed impacts which include a negative effect on silver stage physiology (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012); swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007); and a reduced ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Prevalence of <em>A. crassus</em> has been found to be higher in smaller eels (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017, Hafir-Mansouri <em>et al</em>. 2018), with the proposal that smaller eels feeding mainly on invertebrates have a greater infection intensity than larger, piscivorous eels, because of increased chance of encounter with infected invertebrate hosts (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p><p>Lipophilic pollutant contaminants and metals act as stressors within the continental stage of the European Eel life cycle (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). This can result in damage to the respiratory system, tissues and organs, alter the regular function of endocrine processes, osmoregulation, and haematological dynamics, as well as decreasing protein content, reducing the ability of an eel to cope with physiological stress (Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019, De Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Lipids are essential for allowing normal migration and reproduction (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). As pollutants impair lipid metabolism and storage, it may reduce the ability of silver eels to migration (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). Chemicals stored by eels and released when fat stores are broken down during migration, could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al</em>.&#160; 2019). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low-quality gametes, as well as transmission of pollutants to the larvae (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Sühring <em>et al</em>. 2015, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016;,Freese<em> et al.</em> 2017, 2019, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Nowosad <em>et al</em>. 2018). Ultimately, pollutants may be affecting eels at molecular and individual levels, but also scaling to population and community wide effects (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019). Lipophilic chemical pollutants have been identified as a cause of recruitment failure, although current policies focusing on increasing escapement from continental waters do not consider eel quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). To mitigate impacts of contaminants, it may be valuable for management to integrate methods to improve the condition and quality of both habitats and escaping eels (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). This may also be considered in relation to stocking activities, by ensuring eels have suitable, unpolluted rearing habitat (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Predation also represents a threat to <em>A. anguilla</em> and is increasingly being discussed in relation to competition with commercial and recreational fisheries. Cormorants in particular have been a focus of recent research, which has found eel consumption by cormorants to be of a similar quantity to that of fishery landings in both the Baltic Sea (Hansson <em>et al</em>. 2018) and some lakes in Sweden (Ovegård 2017). Human factors may exacerbate the threat. Under experimental conditions, acoustic disturbance has been found to reduce anti-predation behaviour in eels, affecting likelihood of survival (Simpson <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>Unsustainable exploitation is a threat to the species. Fishing for the European Eel began with small scale fisheries up to the late 1800s, before shifting during the mid-1900s to larger scale, commercial exploitation, with production peaking between 1960–70 (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016, Dekker 2019, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Across its distribution, all continental stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and period of collection. Trade of European Eel continues within the European Union (EU) for consumption, culture and stocking, although export from the EU has been banned since 2010 although over this time period commercial landings of yellow and silver eels have remained relatively consistent (around 2000–3000 tonnes) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>) (see Conservation). Indeed, it seems that yellow/silver eels are declining while glass eel catches increase (European Commission 2020<em>a</em>).</p><p>                          </p><p>Despite the ban on trade outside of the EU, under-reporting, illegal fishing (poaching) and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European Eel fisheries (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is little information regarding illegal exploitation of the European Eel, which is thought to be driven mainly by demand from East Asia for use as a substitute for <em>Anguilla japonica</em>, due to the reduced abundance of glass eels of this species (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Assessment of the impact of this component of fishery exploitation is therefore extremely difficult. Export of European Eel outside of EU borders is visible through trade statistics, and enforcement agencies report the tonnage of successful operations where shipments have been intercepted, and seizures made (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). A review of exploitation, including an attempt to understand the scale of eel trafficking for the European Eel was conducted by Stein and Dekker in Kaifu <em>et al</em>. (2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Determining changes in the stock of European Eel is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, eels in continental waters, and escapement. Not only can there be a large time lag (10's of years) between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed, for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the population dynamics of the oceanic phase of <em>A. anguilla</em> (ICES 2013<em>a</em>). </p><p>Assessment of datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account the following: consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether data were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.</p><p>There are more available datasets for <em>A. anguilla</em> in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa. For the purposes of analysing recruitment trends, ICES often refers to the North Sea subpopulation in separate terms to the rest of Europe. This is because the rate of decline in abundance of <em>A. anguilla </em>recruitmen<em>t </em>has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to elsewhere (ICES 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985. Declines in both the North Sea and elsewhere indices are presented and considered. Unless otherwise stated, data were accessed through relevant contacts in the EIFAAC/ICES/GFCM Working Group on Eels (WGEEL).<br/> <br/> </p><p><strong>Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Glass eel and young-of-year recruitment data used to inform this assessment were taken from the analysis provided in ICES (2019<em>a</em>). Data used in the ICES recruitment index were from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium in the “North Sea” series, and UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy in the “Elsewhere” series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment is based largely on data from the Baltic area where only yellow stage eels are recruited (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). <br/> <br/> Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent-wide decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. The ICES recruitment index fell to its lowest historical level in 2012: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960–1979 (ICES 2012). In the most recent ICES report, the provisional 2019 recruitment index was at 1.4% of the 1960–1979 reference level in the ‘North Sea’ series, and at 6.0% in the ‘Elsewhere’ series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These provisional values for 2019 show a slight decrease from final 2018 values, which were 1.9% in the ‘North Sea’ index, and 8.9% in the ‘Elsewhere’ index (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). However, statistical analyses conducted on recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment to European waters was 26.4% of the 1960–1979 reference in 2018 (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Data collection for 2019 was stated to be ongoing and so not available at the time of publication (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). The overall decline in recruitment will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES 2012). <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Yellow Eel (standing stock): </strong><br/> There were few time-series data sets available to this assessment for the yellow eel life stage, and they only cover a small amount of the geographical range. Data sets were made available from Skagerrak (southern Norway), Den Burg (Netherlands) and the East Anglian River Basin District (RBD) in the UK (Rivers Blackwater, Colne, Chelmer, Stour) (Environment Agency 2019). Skagerrak and Den Burg data derive from beach seines and fyke nets, respectively, and the East Anglian RBD data derive from electrofishing surveys. Data from Skagerrak contained mostly yellow eels, with some silvers, whereas the other data sets were for yellow eel only.<br/> <br/> The analyses of yellow eel data suggest declines that were not as severe as that of recruitment:&#160;in the East Anglian RBD, the mean decline&#160;was between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data,&#160;over a period of three generation lengths (39 years);&#160;in Skagerrak and Den Burg, the mean decline mirrored this trend.&#160;There is a variety of published literature describing abundance trends in yellow eels not captured within this analysis - note the following examples are not comprehensive. In the Bristol Channel, sampling conducted between 1981 and 2009 at power station cooling water intakes found yellow eel abundance to decline by 15% per year, to 1% of the level in 1980 (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, abundance decline has been documented in the River Meuse, in Belgium (Matondo and Ovidio 2016), and Ireland, in both the Foyle Estuary (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Lough Sheelin, in the upper River Shannon catchment (MacNamara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Conversely, a study to establish the status of stocks in England and Wales found rivers along the West coast, and some in the northeast remained similar, whereas declines were observed in the south-east (Bark <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fisheries-independent monitoring conducted on six sites along the Swedish west coast found yellow eel CPUE to display a slow increase between 1975 and 2003, after which it decreased, before increasing again from around 2011 (Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Declines in yellow eels were identified earlier than that of glass eel recruitment, occurring since the 1960’s (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016). The less pronounced decline in the yellow eel data analysed here compared to those reported for glass eel indices could be partially due to density-dependent mortality confounding the effects of changes in recruitment (Svedäng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline. </p><p><strong>Silver Eels:</strong><strong><br/> </strong><br/> For silver eels, there is similar uneven geographical spread of data.&#160;Data sets of silver eel escapement were available from France (MNHN-Dinard and UMS PatriNat unpub. data.), Norway and Ireland and were collected from scientific surveys. Note that the silver eel escapement estimates generated for EMPs are only available from 2010 and therefore not dating back long enough to be used in these analyses.</p><p>Based on these data, silver eel decline does not appear as pronounced as for recruitment indices but, similar to yellow eels (standing stock), they indicated a mean decline of&#160;&#160;between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data, over the period of three generation lengths (39 years).&#160;Again, the less pronounced decline compared to recruitment indices may be due to density-dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in recruitment and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>Note</em>: The 2019 ICES data call included a request for available data on abundance trends for the standing stock of yellow and silver eels (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Information collected for yellow eels included long-term monitoring across various habitats for 70 sites, and for silver eels across 28 sites (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These data have not been reported by ICES yet, but future analysis will provide a more accurate understanding of the situation.</p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011), for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007), as well as in Sweden (Gärdenfors 2010), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN Comité français, MNHN, SFI and AFB 2019), Ireland (King <em>et al</em>. 2011) and north Belgium (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). Indeed, the European Eel showed the largest negative trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Norway the status is now Vulnerable (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015).<br/> <br/> For the North African range there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that <em>A. anguilla</em> is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).</p><p>Currently, the best estimate metric for translation into the IUCN criteria for ‘Mature Individuals’ is the silver eel life stage, although this has its limitations. Following escapement from continental waters, there is the possibility that a proportion of silver eels may succumb to the effects of sub-lethal impacts incurred during growth / escapement and/or be predated before reaching the breeding area to spawn. </p><p>                      </p><p>An alternative metric that could be used in place of silver eel escapement is numbers of leptocephali collected close to the breeding area, as this would also give an indication of the state of the spawning stock. In 2011, sampling across the breeding area for <em>A. anguilla, A. rostrata</em> and other non-anguillid species was conducted, following the same methods as previous sampling in this area that occurred in 1983 and 1985, just after the beginning of the decline in eels occurred in 1980 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). Results from this study were compared with the previous sampling, and significantly lower numbers of European Eel leptocephali were collected in 2011, with a reduction in catch rate of 89% and 64% compared to sampling in 1983 and 1985, respectively (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation depicts a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding area over this time period, suggesting a reduction in the spawning stock, and correlating with the reduction in recruitment to continental waters. This is of great concern for the future resilience of the population.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> occurs in most inland waters of Europe and is distributed from North Cape in northern Norway, southwards along the coast of Europe, all coasts of the Mediterranean and on the North African coast (Schmidt 1909, Dekker 2003<em>b</em>). It very rarely enters the White and Barents seas, but it has been recorded eastward to the Pechora River in northwest Russia. The species occurs in low abundance in the Black Sea region where it migrates east to the Kuban drainage (occasional individuals reach the Volga drainage through canals). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> also occurs in northern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. A report by the ICES Study Group on Anguillid Eels in Saline Waters (SGAESAW) indicates that eel stocks can contain a mix of freshwater residents, saline water residents, and inter‐habitat migrants (ICES 2009). The continental distribution of the European Eel is over an area of approximately 90,000 km²&#160;in Europe and parts of North Africa (Moriarty and Dekker 1997), with a substantially larger range if their marine distribution is considered. </p><p>For several decades prior to a cessation of import to, and export from, the EU in 2010, <em>A. anguilla</em> was also exported to Asia for seed stock in eel farms (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species may well have been introduced in some parts of Asia (through escape or release from farms, e.g. Arai <em>et al</em>. 2017), however these will not contribute to the spawning stock and therefore areas of introduction have been excluded in the range information. </p><p>    </p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring, before eggs hatch and leptocephalus larvae migrate back across the Atlantic to begin the continental phase of their life history (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk17388906""></a><a name=""_Hlk17388861"">The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver</a>, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There is clear evidence for this in the case of <em>A. anguilla</em>. Traditionally, European Eel was consumed within its European and North African range states – yellow and silver eels were fished for direct consumption, and glass eels were caught for farming and also for consumption (mainly in Spain). Although still consumed within Europe, in recent decades European Eel became increasingly important in fulfilling demand in East Asia (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crook 2010, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>According to FAO data, total annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production (catch and aquaculture) has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Historically, eel farms used species of local provenance. France, Spain, Portugal and the UK are the principal fishing nations for glass eels, and Italy, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands the main producers of farmed European Eel for consumption within Europe. However, towards the end of the 1990s, a decline in stocks of Japanese Eels, combined with the apparently cheap and abundant supplies of European Eel glass eels, led to many Asian eel farms in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, supplementing farms with the European Eel (<a name=""_Hlk17273106"">Briand <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>, Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>Concerns over the impact international trade was having on European Eel led to it being listed in Appendix II of CITES in 2007. This listing came into force on 13 March 2009 – since then any international trade in this species needs to be accompanied by a permit. In December 2010, however, the European Union (EU) decided to ban all imports and exports of European Eel to and from the EU, as authorities felt they were unable to determine that trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of the species (a requirement for issuance of permits for CITES Appendix II-listed species). There were a number of exceptions to this ban: trade in “pre-Convention” specimens was permitted until the end of 2015), and internal EU trade is still allowed. Trade from non-EU range States to non-EU countries also still occurs (Musing <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>Global FAO catch data for European Eel are available for the period of 1950–2017, peaking at nearly 20,000 t in 1968 but declining thereafter and between 2013 and 2017, annual catches averaged just over 3,000 t. Over 60% of these catches were reported by five EU Member States: Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The principal non-EU range States reporting catches (10% of the total) were Egypt, Norway, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco (FAO 2019). Fishing of various life stages continues in a number of range States, but in many cases, catch is now being limited by quotas or other measures set as part of National Eel Management Plans, fulfilling requirements outlined in Eel Regulation - see Conservation Measures. Reported annual glass eel landings in the EU have declined since 1980, to 62.2 t in 2018, and 58.6 t in 2019 (provisional) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years. According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight; China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown in farms, which includes <em>A. anguilla </em>(Musing<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2018).</p><p>Due to a lack of species-specific Customs data, the precise quantities of European Eel in trade are still unknown. However, imports reported by East Asian Customs of live juvenile <em>Anguilla</em> eels from European Eel range States for farming purposes (defined as “live eel fry” in East Asia) provide a good indication of the amount of European glass eels in trade outside of the EU (both legal and illegal). Between 2003 and 2008, annual live eel fry imports from European eel range States to mainland China, Taiwan, Province of China, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong fluctuated between ~36 and 70 t. In 2009, annual imports dropped to ~9 t and in 2010 they increased again to nearly 28 t. Since 2011, reported annual imports of live eel fry from <em>A. anguilla </em>range States remained less than 10 t. France and Spain were the principal source countries among <em>A. anguilla </em>range States until 2010 (when commercial<em> A. anguilla</em> trade to and from the EU was banned). Imports from non-EU <em>A. anguilla </em>range States, especially from Morocco, began in 2009 and gradually increased over the years, despite a ban for export of glass eels being imposed in this range state since 2013 (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). Due to the reduced availability of European glass eels over the last decade, increasing quantities of glass eels of other <em>Anguilla</em> species have also been imported into East Asia to fulfil demand in farms (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>Since 2009, species-specific CITES trade data for European eel have been reported. Between 2009 and 2016, over 1000 t of live <em>A. anguilla </em>and another ~1000 t of meat/bodies were reportedly exported from a number of European Eel range States (mainly Morocco and Tunisia). Main destinations were Korea and Hong Kong. In addition, over 50,000 t of meat/bodies were re-exported, mainly from China to Japan (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There are serious concerns over illegal harvesting and trade of <em>A. anguilla.</em> In recent years, authorities have increasingly reported the involvement of organised criminal networks in the movement of legally and illegally sourced European glass eels from the EU to East Asia, principally to China, and have seen traders regularly change travelling routes and their <em>modus operandi </em>to circumvent controls (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). In 2015, EUROPOL initiated Operation LAKE, a European initiative aimed at combatting illegal eel trade. Under this umbrella, there have been a number of investigations into eel smuggling in air freight and personal luggage. For example, in 2017, Greek and Spanish authorities dismantled an international criminal network suspected of having smuggled 10 t of eels from the EU to China; raids led to the arrest of 32 individuals and seizure of 2 t of <em>A. anguilla </em>worth EUR 2 million (Europol 2017). However, European Eel appears to still be in the supply chain in East Asia – a recent paper indicated it was prevalent in supermarket products in Hong Kong (Richards&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>While there is demand for the species, pressures from trade, and unknown quantities in illegal trade, continue to be a serious conservation concern for the species. </p><p>                    </p><p>A detailed recent analysis of trade in <em>A. anguilla</em>, including Customs, CITES and seizure data, is provided in Musing <em>et al. </em>(2018).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination, which is of particular concern when dealing with a panmictic stock. Protection can be achieved effectively at a national or local level, distributed throughout individual management units, but an international objective is necessary to orchestrate this management (Dekker 2016).<br/> <br/> The Eel Regulation (EC Regulation 1100/2007; EU 2007) is an EU-wide recovery plan for the European Eel, adopted in 2007. As instructed by the regulation, EU member states have been developing and implementing Eel Management Plans (EMPs) with the objective to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.” (EU 2007). Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and most actions have focussed on commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping station obstacles, and measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control (ICES 2013<em>b</em>,&#160;European Commission 2020<em>a</em>). Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries (ICES 2013<em>b</em>).</p><p>In a review of EMPs, eel biomass per hectare fell within a narrow range for most countries, apart from France and Spain, whose values were higher than what was reported for other countries (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). The most recent reporting (2018) did not provide mortality rate estimates for all EMPs, and therefore rates could not be summed to reflect the state of impacts across Europe (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). In December 2017, EU Member States reached an agreement prohibiting fishing for eels &gt;12 cm in marine waters of the Atlantic and North Sea over a three-month period (determined by each Member State) between 2018 and 2019 to aid eel recovery (Council of the EU 2018). In 2019, in line with measures implemented by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), this decision extended the mandatory closures to recreational and glass eel fisheries covering brackish waters (Council of the EU 2019).</p><p> As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total was required to reserve a minimum of 60% of their catch from 31 July 2013 onwards for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking waters with glass eels from elsewhere). Although there is evidence showing restocking to be beneficial at enhancing silver eel production within water bodies, the overall effectiveness of restocking programmes at enhancing the spawning stock remains open to debate (ICES 2016). Reviews (ICES 2012, 2016, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of restocking to the recovery of the panmictic European Eel state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions can be drawn either way. Until restocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012). </p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). Overall, escapement of silver eels remains below the 40% target biomass (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Catches of yellow and silver eel life stages were found to have declined, while glass eel catch has been steadily increasing (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Overall, there has been progress towards a reduction in fishing effort, but in some Member States’ effort has risen (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Anthropogenic mortality unrelated to fishing has not significantly declined, and this has received little focus in the EMPs and related actions (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). The report ultimately stated ""The Regulation’s success in ensuring the recovery of the European eel is still far from certain, as it is widely recognised that the recovery of the European eel will take many decades. In this respect, further ambition is needed to implement the Regulation with a greater focus on non-fisheries related measures.""</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In addition to the Eel Regulation, in 2007, the European eel was included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (CITES 2007). The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time exporters were required to acquire permits. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and export is deemed non-detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF). In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded an NDF was not possible for this species, and so a zero import/export policy was set for the EU, which is still in place (EC 2010, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2018, several reports investigating the challenges and lessons learnt in relation to implementing the Appendix II listing, including its enforcement and illegal trade were published (CITES 2018, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2008, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010). In 2014, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) to catalyse collaborative conservation across range States, providing additional support for conservation and monitoring of the species (CMS 2014). Since the listing there have been three range state meetings in order to develop a mechanism under which signatories will work. At the most recent CMS Conference of the Parties in 2020, it was agreed a species Action Plan would be developed for the European Eel.</p><p>              </p><p>Across Europe, programmes for “trap and transport” (downriver transport), and “assisted migration” (upriver transport), are in place to provide eels with access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. When applied to migrating silver eels, it can have a significant and immediate effect on local escapement. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, future recruitment (e.g. for barriers: van der Meer 2012, McCarthy <em>et al.</em> 2014, Béguer-Pon <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by eliminating the barriers to navigation, or at least, providing more effective passage for eels.<br/> <br/> Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. A number of assessment models have been developed; Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam) (Bevacqua and De Leo 2006), Eel Density Analysis (EDA) (EDA 2.2: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2015, EDA 2.2.1: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2018), German Eel Model (GEM) (GEM II: Oeberst and Fladung 2012, GEM III: Oeberst and Fladung 2014), and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II) (SMEP: developed by El-Hosaini, Bark, Knights, Williams and Kirkwood; Aprahamian <em>et al</em>. 2007). Using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe, earlier iterations of these models were reviewed by Walker <em>et al.</em> (2011). The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/> In 2019,&#160; ICES stated that: “The status of European eel remains critical”, and that “all anthropogenic impacts (e.g. caused by recreational and commercial fishing on all stages, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) that decrease production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to,&#160; or kept as close as possible to,&#160; zero in 2020” (ICES 2019<em>b</em>). In 2019, provisional recruitment estimates remain low across the geographical range. Although, recruitment during the period of 2011–2019 has shown an increasing trend, statistically significant from zero. This highlights the necessity for continued, effective conservation across the range for <em>A. anguilla</em>.&#160;</p><p></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The wild bird and the <em>P. maracana</em> apparently produced infertile eggs, although one experienced very early embryo death, subsequent DNA analysis revealing a hybrid. <p></p>","The decline of the species has generally been attributed to two principal factors. First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio São Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record. The remaining caatinga habitat has suffered degradation and clearance as a result of grazing by cattle and goats (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012).",The species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild (Butchart <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2018).,,"This species was known for over 150 years, from small numbers of traded birds and a hunted bird taken by von Spix, until it was traced in 1985-1986 to near the rio São Francisco in north Bahia, <strong>Brazil</strong>. Only three birds remained and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw <em>Propyrrhura maracana</em>, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female <em>C. spixii</em> was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line<strong></strong> (Caparroz <em>et al. </em>2001). The wild bird was still paired with the female <em>P. maracana</em> in January 2000 (Y. de Melo Barros <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000) but neither bird has been seen since the end of that year. In 2000, the total number of publicly declared birds in captivity was 60, but 54 of these were captive-bred (Schischakin 2000). The official captive population in 2015 totalled over 100 individuals (EcoAmericas 2015), with further individuals in private ownership. There have been occasional local reports, including from Serra da Capivara National Park, and a bird was filmed near Curaçá in June 2016, but this is now thought to have been a release from captivity. There have been no other records since 2000, despite fieldworker presence and surveying effort. Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant (Akcakaya <em>et al.</em> 2017, Keith <em>et al.</em> 2017, Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2017) the probability of Spix's Macaw being extant in the wild was estimated at 0.00006 based on records and surveys, and 0.083 based on threats (Butchart <em>et al.</em> 2018). Based on the probability thresholds recommended by Butchart <em>et al.</em> (2018), the species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild.<p></p>","Spix's Macaw has historically been trapped for food locally, as well as traded internationally as a cage-bird.",Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong><br/>CITES Appendix I and protected under Brazilian law.

Habitat loss and degradation are thought to be the key threats. Among these, fire suppression is probably the most serious threat, but also urban development, intensive grazing and browsing by livestock and native and introduced ungulates, and agricultural conversion have caused significant habitat loss in North America (Grzybowski 1995, J. Lyons <em>in litt.</em> 1999, USFWS 2018a). In the wintering range, habitat has been cleared for agriculture and grazing, reducing the potential suitable area or causing habitat fragmentation and declines in habitat quality (<span class=""hps"">Miles <em>et al</em>. 2006, González-Medina<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009)<span class=""hps"">. Further threats include brood parasitism. Brown-headed Cowbirds (<em>Molothrus ater</em>) inflict rates of parasitism of up to 100% at some sites (Grzybowski 1995, Farrell <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rates of nest predation as high as 50% in some locations have been reported. Snakes and birds are the primary predators of this species, with mammals, ants (e.g. fire ants <em>Solenopsis </em>spp.) and katydids also found to predate the species (Stake and Cimprich 2003, Campomizzi <em>et al</em>. 2009, Conkling <em>et al</em>. 2012, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Furthermore, habitat may be fragmented by the development of oil and gas pipelines as well as access corridors for windfarms (L. O'Donnell <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The high return rates of birds to breeding territories suggests few threats on the wintering grounds, even though less than 10% of the wintering area is protected (Grzybowski 1995, <span class=""hps""><span class=""hps"">Vega Rivera <em>et al</em>. 2011, USFWS 2018a).

In Ireland, logging of mature trees in conifer plantations may pose a threat to nesting Merlins (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018).","The European population is estimated at 20,000-41,700 pairs, which equates to 40,100-83,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).&#160;Europe forms approximately 15% of the global range so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 267,000-556,000 mature individuals. Partners in Flight (2020) estimate the North American population at approximately 1,600,000 mature individuals, and the global population at 3,200,000 mature individuals. Given the wide range of the population estimates, the global population is placed in the band 250,000-3,200,000 mature individuals.",Stable,,"In North America, falconers harvest a small number of Merlins each year, but this is carefully regulated and is unlikely to have a significant effect on populations (Millsap &amp; Allen 2006).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation actions underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendix II, Raptors MOU Category 3, EU Birds Directive Annex I.

However based on ongoing deforestation across breeding areas and trapping pressures across wintering grounds, the population is inferred to be undergoing a continued decline. Thus, the species now qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.&#160;<p></p>","The species inhabits regions of 'Satoyama', described as the natural environment between native nature and urban areas (Wild Bird Society of Japan [Tokyo]&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). It breeds from suburban forest patches to heavily forested areas, including coniferous, broadleaved and degraded forest, on hills and the lower slopes of mountains (up to 1,500 m), where there are watercourses and damp areas. It winters in dark, deeply shaded forest near water up to 2,400 m.&#160;The preferable nesting trees are broadleaved trees such as <em>Prunus</em>&#160;and <em>Quercus</em> sp. (Ishikawa <em>et al</em>. 2012), while they nest on coniferous trees, such as pines and cedars, in some areas (Yamashina 1941, Kurahara 1990). It forages mainly in forest, but will use swamps, rice-fields and farmland and is mainly crepuscular. Breeding has been recorded from April to August (Komiya and Sugita 1975,&#160;Kawana 2006)<strong></strong>. A habitat model showed that precipitation and the number of abandoned rice fields were good predictors of occurrence for this species, with this habitat likely providing food source and nesting trees. Forest plantations were negatively associated with species occurrence (Hamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2014). Earthworms are probably the principal food source, but land snails, cicadas, crabs, and ground and scarabid beetles are all present in its diet (Kawakami <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005, K. Kawakami <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, Oh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The main threat was previously considered to be deforestation for timber and agriculture in both its breeding and non-breeding ranges.&#160;The drastic decrease in Japan since the 1960s also coincides with the period of a large decrease in forest area across wider Southeast Asia (Kawakami and Higuchi 2003). In the same period, summer visiting birds in Japan had decreased, although resident species were stable or had increased (Higuchi and Morishita 1999). Habitat destruction in the wintering areas is now considered as the main cause of population reduction. However, loss of forest floor vegetation and the subsequent loss of soil due to Sika Deer&#160;<em>Cervus nippon&#160;</em>may also affect viability of breeding populations in Japanese forests (S. Hayama&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Small-scale housing developments, solar power generation, cemetery development, and a general reduction in incentive to maintain biodiversity may also be negatively impacting some breeding sites (Wild Bird Society of Japan [Tokyo]&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The development of dense scrub undergrowth in forest and on abandoned farmland (following a change in traditional agricultural practices) is also believed to reduce the suitability of these habitats for feeding. It has probably been hunted in many parts of its range (including passage sites in northern Philippines and across its wintering area on Mindanao where it gets caught in snares; P. Simpson <em>in litt</em>. 2020, D. Allen <em>in litt</em>. 2020), and suffers from human disturbance (Anon. 2009). It declined rapidly on Miyake-jima in the Izu Islands, where it was formerly abundant, following the introduction of Siberian Weasel <em>Mustela sibirica</em> in the early 1970s. Today nest predation by corvids is an increasing threat as crow populations increase in urban and suburban areas. <p></p>","Previous work in   Japan suggests the assertion that the global population comprises   fewer than 1,000 individuals may have been overly pessimistic.&#160;These estimations are however not considered accurate by some researchers (K. Kawakami <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Recent mating call detections however recorded 23 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup> in rural secondary forests across the Aichi Prefecture in central Japan (Hamaguchi <em>et al</em>. 2014). The total area of rural secondary forests in Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku islands estimates to 72,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thus, the number of mature individuals is thought to be approximately 8,280. However, mating call detection studies have been considered as an unreliable method of monitoring breeding numbers in this instance due to the species's inconspicuous habits and the potential of receiving duplicated records (K. Ohata <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Similar calling surveys have for example not recorded any nests, and as such breeding birds, despite observing other calling individuals. It is also likely that surveys specific to limited sites (the Aichi area in this instance), may not yield results that are compatible with other suitable habitats across the species's range (K. Ohata&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Habitat models have additionally been considered impractical methods of estimating population numbers or trends (J. Kushlan <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Hence, to account for any uncertainty, the true   figure is placed here in the band of 5,000-9,999 mature individuals, roughly equating to 7,500-15,000 individuals. As per the Waterbird Population Estimates, the species is also thought to occur in only one flyaway population across Eastern and South-eastern Asia (Wetlands International 2020).&#160;This is assumed to represent one subpopulation holding all mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gorsachius goisagi</em> breeds in <strong>Japan</strong>.&#160;Breeding has been mainly recorded from Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku islands, while there are relatively few records in northern Honshu (Wild Bird Society of Japan [Tokyo]&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). During 2009-2010, 26 nests were found in West Mikawa in the Aichi Prefecture (Ishikawa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). In addition to confirmed breeding sites, it is possible that there may be 15 additional sites in Japan (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It is rare vagrant in Hokkaido with no breeding record there (Fujimaki 2012).&#160;There has been one report of breeding from <strong>Taiwan</strong>, China, and recent work has discovered a breeding site at Jeju Island, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">South Korea</span> (Oh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).

There may also be a small resident flock occurring during the breeding seasons in the Jiangxi region of mainland China (He <em>et al. </em>2016). The main wintering area appears to be in the <strong>Philippines</strong>, but it has also been recorded as a non-breeding visitor to <strong>Indonesia</strong>, and as a vagrant to Brunei<strong> </strong>and Palau. Improved awareness of the identification criteria for immatures of this species has led to a marked increase in records from the Philippines (D. Allen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). It was apparently locally common in Japan until the 1970s, but by the 1980s and 1990s had disappeared from many of its former breeding sites. Recent survey work in Japan and increasing numbers of records from the Philippines imply that the population is larger than previously assessed, but is believed to still contain considerably fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.&#160;<br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>It is legally protected in Japan and Hong Kong.

154738156,22693452,Calidris pygmaea,Critically Endangered,A2abcd; C1+2a(ii),2021,2021-06-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Critically Endangered because it has an extremely small population, with a lower bound that is thought to now fall below 250 mature individuals in a single population, that is undergoing a rapid continuing decline in excess of 25% in one generation (with a current estimated 8% annual reduction), and has suffered an extremely rapid population reduction in the previous three generations. The current rate of decline is thought to represent a minor improvement on that over the past three generations but remains very rapid and it still qualifies at the level of Endangered based on the estimated/projected current and future three-generation rate of population reduction. A number of factors are driving the decline, including habitat loss in its breeding, passage and wintering grounds, compounded by disturbance, pollution, and the effects of climate change, however the impact of indiscriminate shorebird hunting appears to be the most immediate and severe threat. Juvenile recruitment has, until recently, been very low, leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly. Extensive conservation work has likely driven the slowing rate of decline, but much more work is required to prevent the extinction of this species.<p></p>  <p></p>","The species has a very specialised breeding habitat, using only lagoon spits with crowberry-lichen vegetation or dwarf birch and willow sedges near lakes and marshes, together with adjacent estuary and mudflat habitats that are used as feeding sites by adults during nesting. It may also use stream-deposited gravel pits (Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species has never been recorded breeding further than 5 km (and exceptionally once 7 km) from the sea shore. Breeding birds are very site-faithful. It breeds either in single pairs or loose aggregations (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. It nests in June-July (Tomkovich 1992, 1995,&#160;Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2020), with failed breeders potentially leaving on migration before others (Zhang Lin 2016). During winter, it prefers mixed sandy tidal mudflats with an uneven surface and very shallow water, mainly in the outermost parts of river deltas and outer islands, often with a higher sand content and thin mud layer on top. In the areas with total coastal conversion, it favours certain stages in the management of saltpans (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The species uses a&#160;variety of feeding techniques that includes a larger variety of food items across the range, including terrestrial insects, small seeds, larvae of beetles and small aquatic amphipods (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2018, Van Gils&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Evidence to support suspicions that immature birds spend their first summer on the wintering grounds until their second year come from ringing recoveries (Tomkovich 1995, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2010a), photographs of a  second calendar-year bird in Thailand in July 2010 (G. Chutima<em> in litt</em>. 2010) and another individual in Bangladesh in June 2015 (S. U. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016),&#160;as well as oversummering and passage birds in the Rudong mudflats (Clark&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Zhang&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;<p></p><p></p>","Throughout its migratory and wintering ranges, tidal flats are being reclaimed for coastal development (industry, leisure, infrastructure, aquaculture and agriculture) and are becoming increasingly polluted. The important staging area at Saemangeum and Geum estuary, South Korea, including the Mangyeung and Tongjin estuaries, has already been reclaimed, and remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2008). Since the reclamation at Saemangeum in 2007, only an average of a single individual has been recorded, in contrast to 'hundreds' prior to the development (Lee <em>et al. </em>2018). Plans for a large-scale reclamation project on the Tiaozini Sandbanks, (part of the Rudong mudflats) were feared to threatened over 60,000 ha of mudflats used by the species by 2020 (Moores 2015,&#160;J. Li and M. Tong to C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017), and elsewhere at Rudong new seawalls were being built in 2015 (Zöckler 2015, Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). However, the national announcement of an end to the reclamation of intertidal land in January 2018 (Anon. 2018, Lei 2018) appears to be a dramatic shift towards alleviating new impacts from this threat and these sites are included in the World Heritage Site nomination.<br/><br/>Smooth Cord-grass&#160;<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>&#160;is an invasive plant used to stabilise mudflats to assist in reclamation along the Chinese coast and rapidly leaves intertidal areas unsuitable for Spoon-billed Sandpipers, dramatically reducing habitat availability (Menxiu <em>et al. </em>2012, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017). At both Rudong and Dongling, <em>Spartina </em><em>alterniflora</em> has formed dense stands with considerable spread noted between spring 2014 and autumn 2015 (Peng <em>et al. </em>2017), and it has also been found on Leizhou mudflat (V. Fu&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2017). The Rudong mudflats are also&#160;the site for development of the largest wind farm in Asia, which could prove to be another threat to this species (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007, 2009, 2010, Li <em>et al. </em>undated)<strong></strong>.&#160;Plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia and cross-dams along the coast of Bangladesh continue to pose threats (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010a, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2011, Zöckler 2015); however, this plan is currently on hold and plans to protect the area have been developed (Zöckler&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009,&#160;<strong></strong>Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009,&#160;Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010b, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler<em> in litt. </em>2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b, Martinez &amp; Lewthaithe 2013)<strong></strong>, and this may be a particularly serious threat to birds wintering on Nan Thar Island and in the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b). A survey of hunting activities in five villages around Sonadia Island, Bangladesh, in September 2010 found that of the 53 hunters interviewed, eight of them claimed to have caught a total of 22 Spoon-billed Sandpipers between October 2009 and April 2010 (Chowdhury 2010). Hunting in the species's non-breeding range could be a crucial factor in the poor rate of recruitment into the breeding population, as immature birds do not return to the breeding areas until they are two years old and thus are more exposed to capture (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b)<strong></strong>. However, recent conservation action aimed at reducing trapping on the wintering grounds appears to have been successful (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014) and may have reduced this significant source of mortality (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016, Aung <em>et al</em>. 2016/2017).&#160;Large-scale wader trapping was observed at Fucheng, south-west Guangdong province, China, where four Spoon-billed Sandpiper were observed in December 2012 (BirdLife Asia 2013), but surveys for the species in south China in January 2017 did not find any illegal mist nets (V. Fu <em>in litt. </em>2017). Monofilament fishing nets set over high tides were found to be a serious problem on the central Chinese coast, with multiple parallel lines of nets set at Tiaozini&#160;in autumn 2015 were found to have captured scores of birds after just one nocturnal high tide, including one juvenile Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Peng <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;Hunting with nets has also been reported from Viet Nam (Long 2015). Recently the scale of hunting in the Russian far northeast has been found to be much greater than previously assumed, and may impact the species during the immediate post-breeding period particularly.<br/><br/>Between August and October 2014, more than a thousand dead wading birds, including two Spoon-billed Sandpipers, were found on the Tiaozini Sandbanks (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017). Tests are ongoing to understand the cause of mortality; however, poisoned bait was discovered in the area.<br/><br/>There are no immediate threats to the breeding grounds, but nests in the vicinity of villages are sometimes destroyed by dogs (<strong></strong>E. Syroechkovskiy <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Poor breeding productivity in recent years has been attributed to heavy nest predation and bad weather (Syroechkovskiy<em> et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>. Significant habitat degradation has been observed in 5 of 30 visited breeding locations (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010)<strong></strong>. Human disturbance, both by residents and researchers, may cause increased levels of nest desertion and predation by foxes and skuas (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Shorebirds, including this species, are also occasionally killed by children with slingshots (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>; one male was also shot by a Russian hunter near the Chinese border in 2008 (Zöckler &amp; Syroechkovskiy 2008)<strong></strong>. Small but significant numbers of birds and their eggs have been collected for scientific purposes in the last 20 years, with one small colony completely wiped out due to this activity (Syroechkovsky 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and other species dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 57% of the breeding habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler &amp; Lysenko 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;Recent observation on the breeding grounds unfortunately confirm a worrying trend of increasing bushes intruding on the coastal tundra habitats in the southern range, as well as drying of the tundra in the northern range with significant&#160;consequences on food access for breeding waders (C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020)<p></p><p></p>","A total of ten repeats of a Lincoln-Peterson method to estimate the global population have resulted in a weighted mean single global estimate of 490 mature individuals (95% confidence limits 360-620) for the six-year period between 2014-2019 (Green <em>et al. </em>2021). However, the most recent winter counts suggest a total number of birds in the order of 330-340 individuals (Zöckler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021), indicating that the total of mature individuals may actually already have fallen below 250 if we assume fewer than three-quarters of these are mature individuals. As such the population is placed within a custom band of 240-620 mature individuals, with a best single value of 490 (Green <em>et al. </em>2021) but noting that this figure may already be outdated.<br/><br/>The trend of these estimates, albeit over a short-time frame, was a mean rate of reduction of 8% (Green <em>et al. </em>2021), similar to the 9% estimated from surveys of the most important wintering population in Myanmar (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010a). However, the confidence interval of the more recent trend estimates overlapped zero, such that there is low confidence in the accuracy of the trend magnitude. In the absence of better information, and noting the congruence with the rate of reduction estimated from wintering surveys, this rate of decline is taken to be the best estimate for the population as a whole for the current timeframe. This rate of reduction is equivalent (using an exponential model of decline) to a three-generation reduction of 68% (over 13.4 years), estimated as a rate of continuing decline of 31.5% in one generation (4.5 years) and 52.7% in two generations (9 years). However, prior to 2009 the rate of population reduction, based on counts of breeding pairs at surveyed locations, was reported to be extremely rapid at an annual rate of 26% between 2002-2008 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010a). As such, the past rate of reduction for the most recent three-generation period (2007-2021) is suspected to have been at a higher rate, and, given the uncertainty, is placed in a band of 70-80%.",Decreasing,"This species has a naturally limited breeding range on the Chukotsk peninsula and southwards to the isthmus of the Kamchatka peninsula, in north-eastern <strong>Russia </strong>(BirdLife International 2001,&#160;Zoeckler &amp; Lappo 2008). It migrates down the western Pacific coast through Russia, <strong>Japan</strong>, <strong>North Korea</strong>, <strong>South Korea</strong>, mainland <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Hong Kong</strong> (China), <strong>Taiwan</strong> (China) and <strong>Viet Nam,</strong> to its main wintering grounds in southern China, Viet Nam, <strong>Thailand</strong>,&#160;<strong>Bangladesh </strong>and <strong>Myanmar </strong>(Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is a vagrant visitor in <strong>Cambodia </strong>and <strong>Indonesia </strong>(during non-breeding seasons here particularly; C.&#160;Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Wintering birds have also been recorded from <strong>India </strong>(with a recent sighting in 2018 possibly the first for 14 years [Roy 2018]), <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, the Fujian province in China (the Min Jiang estuary in Fujian has recently been identified as an important wintering site for the species [F. Cheung <em>in litt. </em>2010, Bai <em>et al</em>. 2015,&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016]), Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China&#160;((Martinez &amp; Lewthwaite 2013,&#160;Fu 2015), and peninsular&#160;<strong>Malaysia</strong>. It occurs regularly at only a few sites within this wintering range, with important sites in Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and China. Sonadia Island and Meghna Estuary (Bangladesh), the Gulf of Martaban and Nan Thar (Myanmar) were believed to support over half of the wintering population (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2018); over 80% of the entire population were considered to winter in Myanmar and Bangladesh (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). However, recent surveys show that the Southern China coast in Guandong and Guanxi Provinces also host significant numbers (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016) and that the numbers in Bangladesh and Myanmar are falling more rapidly than at sites further north along the migratory route (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). It seems likely that the bulk of the population now winters along the Chinese coast.<br/><br/>Records of wintering birds in&#160;Myanmar are of 84 individuals in 2008, 73 in January 2009, and 89 in 2010 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>; 150-220 in the Bay of Martaban in 2010-2012&#160;<strong style=""FONT-WEIGHT: normal"">(</strong>Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2014) and approximately 155 in the upper bay of Martaban in January 2015 (Clark 2015). In 2016, an estimated 100-112 individuals were present in the upper Gulf of Mottama, Myanmar (Aung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, 2020), a reduction from 244 individuals observed in 2009 (Aung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Recent counts reinforce this rapid reduction, with only 47 individuals counted in January 2021 despite high coverage (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>In March-April 2010, a minimum total of 49 individuals were recorded during targeted surveys along the coast of Bangladesh (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2011)<strong></strong>. A new site along the Meghna Estuary was discovered in 2015, which supported a minimum of 48 individuals in February 2016 (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Surveys along the Bangladesh coast from December 2015 to February 2016 found a record number of a minimum of 76 individuals from different sites along the coast, the highest numbers recorded since 1989 in Bangladesh (Chowdhury 2016). However since 2016 numbers located in Bangladesh in winter have fallen rapidly, with fewer than ten counted in January 2021 (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>During the winter of 2015-2016, it was estimated that 10 adults used the Gulf of Thailand (K. Sutasha <em>in litt</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>China Coastal Waterbird Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2013 (Bai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) identified the following sites as of international importance for the species: Yalu Jliang estuarine wetland (Liaoning), Rudong coast (Jiangsu), Dongtai coast (Jiangsu), Dongling coast (Jiangsu), Minjiang Estuary National Nature Reserve (Fujian), Dadeng Island and Weitou Bay (Fujian) and Xitou coast (Guangdong).&#160;<br/><br/>A total of 61 individuals was recorded wintering in southern China (present at ten of 36 surveyed sites) in the January 2021 coordinated surveys (Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance&#160;2021). The Leizhou Peninsula has been identified as an important area, holding about 50 birds (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016, C.

It is likely that a large proportion of the adult population of the species spends time at Rudong, China, in both autumn and spring (Menxiu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is currently the only known moulting site for the species (Bai <em>et al</em>. 2015, Peng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Counts of up to 103 individuals at Rudong in October 2011, 106 in October 2012, 140 in October 2013 (Zöckler and Li 2013), a minimum of 226 in September 2014 and 177-190 in October 2014 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2015) are likely to have accounted for a substantial proportion of the global population (M. Tong <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). A maximum of 100 birds were recorded on the Tiaozini mudflats (part of the Rudong mudflats), Dongtai County, in October 2014 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2015), with more than 100 birds recorded at Tiaozini in October 2015 (Li and Chowdhury 2016). A survey in May 2015 on the Rudong mudflats recorded at least 62 individuals, including a number of head-started birds (Phillips 2015). Modelling work has shown Rudong to be too far for the species to reach in a single flight from its breeding grounds and work is underway to identify another stopover site in the Russian Far East (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Due to its specialised breeding habitat requirements, it was probably always a scarce species, but numbers dropped rapidly, at least between 2000 and 2010 (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Surveys on the breeding grounds revealed a dramatic decline from 2,000-2,800 pairs in the 1970s (which assumes equal distribution of the species and may have potentially excluded unknown sites; C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2019) to fewer than 1,000 pairs in 2000, 402-572 pairs in 2003, 350-380 pairs in 2005 (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong> and not more than 150-320 pairs in 2008. The breeding population in 2009-2010 was optimistically estimated at 120-200 pairs (<strong></strong>Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a<strong></strong>)<strong></strong> in an estimated total population of 500-800 individuals, perhaps indicating an 88% decline since 2002, equating to an annual rate of decline of 26%<strong></strong><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""> </span>(Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a)<strong></strong>. These declines have taken place across all known breeding sites, and it is unlikely that significant colonies remain undiscovered (<strong></strong>Zöckler 2005, <strong></strong>Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Declines were also observed at wintering grounds. For example, no birds were sighted wintering in Viet Nam in 2009 at a site that supported at least 27 birds in the mid 1990s (E. Syroechkovskiy <em>et al. in litt.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. However, over the last few years (2013-2015), there are signs that active conservation interventions may have stemmed this rapid population decline and the small remaining population appears decline at a slower pace of still 8-10% (Aung <em>et al</em>. 2018,&#160;Aung <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Breeding success is quite low: average productivity was 0.66 young fledged per nest in 2005, and much lower in 2007, and this is compounded by a very low rate of juveniles and adults returning to the breeding grounds. Until recently, the species has had an ageing and rapidly declining population with little recruitment (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2010). For example, data collected on birds at one breeding area from 2003 to 2009 suggest that recruitment into the adult breeding population was effectively zero in all years apart from 2005 and 2007 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a)<strong></strong>. In 2013, for the first time there was no decline detected at the core breeding area of Meinypylgino, where the population was stable at c.10 pairs (Zöckler 2013). In June 2014, an expedition to Russkaya Koshka recorded an increase in the number of breeding territories recovering from a low of 1-2 pairs in previous years (Nitschke <em>et al</em>. 2015), but numbers are still not near levels known from the early 2000s (Tomkovich <em>et al.</em> 2002, C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In July 2011 and 2016, an expedition in Kamchatka located each a previously unknown breeding area for the species (Heritage Expeditions 2016), with around 3 pairs each.&#160;<em></em><p></p>","Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007, 2009,&#160;<strong></strong>Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009,&#160;Bird<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2010, Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010b, Martinez and Lewthaithe 2013). Trapping using monofilament nets is also frequent on the Chinese coast during migration periods and Spoon-billed Sandpipers have been observed being caught (Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I and II. The species has been added to the list as a Class 1 protected species on the National Key Protected Wild Animal List of China: it is forbidden to hunt, capture, kill, sell, acquire and use the species (Choi 2021).  Fourteen sites along the coast of Bohai Gulf and the Yellow Sea in China have been nominated for World Heritage Site status. Protected areas in its breeding, staging and wintering areas include Moroshechnaya and several local wildlife refuges on the Chukotsk peninsula (Russia), Yancheng and Chongming Dongtan (China), Mai Po (Hong Kong), Lanyang estuary (Taiwan, China), Point Calimere and Chilka lake (India), and Xuan Thuy Nature Reserve (Vietnam). In September 2019 the Bird Conservation Society of Thailand completed the purchase of 8 hectares to conserve habitat at Pak Thale, within the Pak Thale-Laem Phak Bia Flyway Network site recognised by the Government of Thailand (Jearwattanakanok &amp; Yong 2019). The Gulf of Mottama (160,000 ha), Myanmar has also been proposed as a Ramsar site and the area belonging to Mon State is soon to be designated (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zöckler 2015). This work across the Gulf of Mottama headed by the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Task Force, with support from the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Rainforest Trust, also ensure sustainable development in line with conservation goals (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is also legally protected under the Wildlife Act of Myanmar, however the law lacks full implementation (Aung <em>et al</em>. 2020). In 2019, the main stop over sites in Tiaozini (Rudong) were also included into the World Heritage Site nomination (C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Hunters within the area have also signed agreements to surrender trapping equipment and engage in alternate livelihoods (Ceci 2017). Work by the group 'SBS in China' recently lead to the local government designating a 10,000 ha area for Spoon-billed Sandpipers in Rudong (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Chinese government have additionally declared a moratorium for future coastal development (P. Insua-Cao <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Shellfish protected areas have also been designated, which will provide suitable feeding habitat for birds and protect local livelihoods. <br/><br/>Annual surveys of breeding sites on Chukotka are undertaken and over 450 adults and young have been ringed on the breeding grounds since 2000 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Annual searches of potential new breeding sites have taken place from 2011 to at least 2013 (Zöckler 2013).&#160;Recent advances on the protection of important site for the species have additionally accelerated. In Myanmar, 2 further Ramsar sites protects the species in&#160;the the Ayeyarwady Delta (50,000 ha) and Nan Thar Island (40,000), with a vast increase in the official protection level, including preparations for the last remaining site in the south of the country to be protected (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). &#160;Since 2018, the government of Chukotka is also supporting the development of a 300,000 ha large protected area that is adequately named the Land of the Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Syroechkovsky 2019).<br/> <br/>A range of awareness and outreach programmes have taken place. Local support groups have been established in some breeding areas and negotiations have taken place to reduce short-term hunting pressure at one of the key wintering sites in Myanmar (Zöckler &amp; Htin Hla 2009, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>. Researchers and a local environmentalist group convinced two villages on Nan Thar Island, Myanmar, to agree to a hunting ban of the species, with a view to develop an ecologically and economically sound alternative in the future (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>. The development of ecotourism at Nan Thar generated extra income for local people and encouraged them to protect the birds (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Bay of Martaban, socio-economic surveys carried out in early 2010 indicated that bird-hunting is undesirable and that most hunters would readily switch to alternative livelihoods if assisted<strong></strong> (BANCA 2010)<strong></strong>. These surveys were swiftly followed by mitigation activities in the same year, in which hunters agreed to stop their activities in exchange for equipment to provide them with an alternative income source, and awareness-raising events and materials were provided for whole communities (BANCA<em> in litt</em>. 2010)<strong></strong>. On the eastern shore of the Gulf of Martaban, 9 out of 15 hunters targeted by the mitigation activities had increased their livelihood status, the remaining six had neither increased nor decreased their livelihood status (BANCA 2012). Conservationists in Bangladesh successfully raised funds to provide hunters with loans so that they could establish new livelihoods, such as farming (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The Bangladesh Spoon-billed Sandpiper Conservation Project conducted a one year awareness-raising project on Sonadia Island, an important wintering site for the species (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). Activities involved former hunters visiting schools to talk about conservation work, film showings, boat races, mural painting and photography exhibitions (S. U. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;In 2011, awareness-raising and advocacy activities including two training workshops took place in schools in China. Schoolchildren living close to the species's breeding grounds in Russia have also been taught about the species and sent letters to other schoolchildren living along the flyway asking them to protect the species (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>A Species Action Plan was produced in 2006 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2008), and updated in 2008 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong> and 2010 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b)<strong></strong>. At the fifth meeting of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership in Cambodia in December 2010, the partners agreed to establish a Task Force for this species, charged with implementing the action plan (Fowlie 2011).&#160;In 2012, the 'Saving Spoony's Chinese Wetlands' project came top in a vote organised by the Disney Foundation, winning $100,000 to support conservation efforts for the species (Clark&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Headstarting, or artificial incubation and captive rearing on the breeding grounds, avoids the high levels of natural predation that occur at egg and chick stage. This significantly increased breeding success, with the number of wild birds fledged increasing by approximately five times per pair (D. Pain&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). In addition, by taking eggs within days of them being laid early in the season, some birds lay a second clutch that they incubate and raise themselves. Headstarting expeditions in 2012 and 2013 have resulted in the release of a total of 25 juveniles from 35 eggs collected (Zöckler 2013). In 2015, 37 eggs were collected for headstarting in Chukotka, of which 35 were fertile (B. Hughes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015). In July 2016, the headstarting programme successfully released 30 fledglings, the most birds released in a single year. 22 chicks from 30 eggs survived to fledging in 2020, but despite continued releases the number of headstarted birds appears to have ceased offsetting the decline at the release site in 2019 (Syroechkovskiy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).<br/><br/>A&#160;captive-rearing and breeding programme started in 2011, when eggs were collected in Chukotka, and the young birds reared in captivity in Russia were subsequently transported to purpose-built conservation breeding facilities at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust headquarters at Slimbridge,<strong> </strong>UK (Pain 2010)<strong></strong>. In 2012, eggs were transported from Chukotka direct to Slimbridge (Pain <em>et al</em>. 2011, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2013). In May 2014 the captive population numbered 25 birds (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). Two pairs of captive birds at Slimbridge started to breed in 2016 (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016). One chick fledged in 2018 but unfortunately died shortly after, but two chicks were successfully reared fledging in 2019 and remain alive in 2021. No further successful breeding has occurred, and in 2020 several of the eight and nine year-old founders of the captive population died, possibly due at least in part to age (Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust 2021).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to develop captive breeding programmes and continue to monitor numbers at known breeding sites and carry out searches of suitable habitat in north Kamchatka. Continue to survey wintering sites to monitor the population and identify key sites in the East Asian Flyway to help ensure their protection. Campaign against the continued reclamation of intertidal mudflats along the entire migration route. Restore reclaimed wetland sites.&#160;Continue to search for stopover sites in the Russian Far East (Clark&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Actively prevent collection of eggs and birds for scientific purposes, museums and private collections. Take measures to ensure that researcher activity does not increase mortality. Ensure effective legal protection of all known breeding sites. Survey existing and potential wintering sites in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Stop hunting and trapping at key sites in Myanmar, Bangladesh and Russia. Ensure awareness-raising activities are maintained in the long-term. Ensure protection of newly discovered sites and existing sites, especially in South Korea. Legally protect it in all range states. Identify and mitigate pressures at breeding grounds. Lobby against plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia, Bangladesh (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury 2012) and protect important sites along the Meghna Estuary, Bangladesh (Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Pursue protected area status for the Bay of Martaban and other coastal sites in Myanmar (BANCA<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2014). Encourage initiatives that promote opportunities for ex-hunters to become bird guides (P. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<p></p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Declines are attributed to non-target poisoning, including from diclofenac, but also direct mortality due to collisions with energy infrastructure, increased disturbance and a reduction in food availability.","<p><strong>Behaviour</strong> It is resident where it occurs, but has vast home ranges, and juveniles will wander even more widely than adults (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<strong> Habitat </strong>The species occupies remote, mountainous areas, with precipitous terrain, usually above 1,000 m, though can occur down to 600 m (R. Naoroji&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2011, H. Ibrahim <em>in litt. </em>2016), and in particular areas where large predators such as wolves and Golden Eagles are present, and there are herds of mammals such as mountain goats, ibex, and sheep (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<strong> Diet </strong>The species will forage over vast distances (up to 700 km in one day has been recorded), using a soaring flight. Its principle food is carrion, with its diet including a large proportion of bones (as much as 85%) whereupon the bird gets nutrition from the marrow inside. The rest of its diet comprises tortoises, and occasionally also live mammals and birds. It is generally unwilling to compete with vultures at carcasses, and will wait patiently to feed, scavenging older carcasses if fresh meat is scarce. Bones are either consumed whole, broken using the bill, hammered against the ground, or lifted into the air and dropped from 50-80 m high onto hard rock. Tortoises and hyraxes are generally treated in the same way as bones.&#160; It is known to scavenge in rubbish dumps, including urban areas in Ethiopia (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<strong> Breeding&#160;</strong>The species will construct large nests (averaging 1-m diameter), composed of branches and lined with animal remains such as skin and wool, as well as dung and occasionally also rubbish. Nests are located on remote overhung cliff ledges or in caves and will be re-used over the years. Breeding occurs from December to September in Europe and northern Africa; October–May in Ethiopia; May-January in southern Africa; year-round in much of eastern Africa; and December-June in India (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<strong></strong></p>","<span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says"">The main causes  of on-going declines appear to be non-target poisoning,  direct  persecution, habitat degradation, disturbance of breeding birds,   inadequate food availability, changes in livestock-rearing practices and  collisions with powerlines  and wind turbines (Ferguson-Lees and  Christie 2001, Barov and Derhé 2011, S.

Disturbance has also increased due to improved accessibility to mountain sites (Izquierdo 2018). Rapid increases in grazing pressure and human populations in the mountains of Turkey are causing habitat degradation there (S. Viter <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Suitable habitat is also threatened by pipeline construction through the Caucasus mountains (S. Viter <em>in litt</em>. 2014). In parts of the range where transhumance occurs, there may be asymmetries in food availability at different times of year (Margalida&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Three of five failed eggs of this species and four dead nestlings sampled in the Spanish Pyrenees from 2005-2008 had high concentrations of multiple veterinary drugs (especially fluoroquinolones) and evidence of several livestock pathogens (Blanco and Lemus 2010). The recent approval for commercialisation of veterinary diclofenac in Spain may have devastating effects on European vultures - in 2020 a Cinereous Vulture was confirmed as the first individual to die from veterinary diclofenac in Europe (BirdLife 2021).

EU Birds Directive Annex I. CMS Appendix II. Raptors MOU Category 1. A Multi-species Action Plan for African-Eurasian Vultures has been produced (Botha&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;In Europe, captive breeding and reintroduction programmes have been  carried out in the Austrian, French, Italian and Swiss Alps with  individuals subsequently spreading into other parts of France (Snow and  Perrins 1998, Frey and Walter 1989). Reintroduction programmes are underway in parts of Spain (J. A. Gil Gallus <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Feeding stations have been provided  in the Pyrenees with resulting increases in numbers of the species, and  the provision of similar stations across the species’s range could  improve its global population density (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). However, while these have helped to increase population growth and individual survival, they can have negative impacts on vultures; for instance they can lead to habitat saturation, with individuals' territories overlapping at these areas, and can lead to reduced productivity (Carrete <em>et al. </em>2009, Gil <em>et al. </em>2014). For example, the reintroduced population in the Central Alps increased exponentially between 1998 and 2015, but due to a high level of philopatry there has been little dispersal away from the initial release site, resulting in a high density of breeding pairs in the core area (Jenny <em>et al. </em>2018). Habitat saturation may also lead to polygyny (Gil <em>et al. </em>2017). Supplementary feeding in poor-quality territories and extraction of the extra young produced has successfully been used as a cheaper alternative to captive breeding for reintroduction programmes (Ferrer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017), however there are concerns that this may negatively impact the population from which the young are extracted (Margalida&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). A reintroduction programme was attempted in Kenya in 1999-2003 (S. Thomsett <em>in litt</em>. 2011). The species is monitored in Southern Africa, with an annual count day which not only aids in the monitoring of the species, but also raises awareness (Krüger 2015). A Single Species Action Plan for the conservation of the Western Palearctic population of Bearded Vulture was published in 2018 (Izquierdo <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct coordinated surveys to monitor the species's global population trend. Assess the threat posed by diclofenac and other drugs used in livestock, as well as the impacts of climate change and feral dogs. Reduce disturbance in and around nesting areas. Mitigate against the impacts of wind turbines and powerlines. Combat the threat of persecution through laws and awareness-raising activities. Provide feeding stations throughout the species's range. Try to address the illegal trade and use of vultures in medicine (Krüger 2015). Assess methods of negating the negative impacts that result from feeding stations (see Carrete <em>et al. </em>2009, Moreno-Opo <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;<br/>The Single Species Action Plan for the conservation of the Western Palearctic population of Bearded Vulture, <em>Gypaetus barbatus barbatus</em>, (2018) was prepared in the framework of the EuroSAP (LIFE14 PRE/UK/000002) LIFE project, produced by Vulture Conservation Foundation and co-ordinated by BirdLife International. It provides a comprehensive programme of research and conservation measures needed to conserve this species in its European range. As well as the actions mentioned above, it highlights the threat of lead poisoning, the need for collaboration with farmers to mitigate livestock-wildlife conflicts and the need to do more to conserve genetic diversity, including through creating a captive genetic reservoir.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Consequently it qualifies as Near Threatened. <p></p>","The species inhabits forested areas in hills and mountains at 300-1,400 m in Spain, but higher in Asia, where it also occupies scrub and arid and semi-arid alpine steppe and grasslands up to 4,500 m<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Thiollay 1994). It forages over many kinds of open terrain, including forest, bare mountains, steppe and open grasslands.  Nests are built in trees or on rocks (the latter extremely rarely in Europe but more frequently in parts of Asia), often aggregated in very loose colonies or nuclei.  Its diet consists mainly of carrion from medium-sized or large mammal carcasses, although snakes and insects have been recorded as food items. Live prey is rarely taken. In Mongolia, at least, the species is reliant on livestock numbers for successful nesting (Batbayar <em>et al</em>. 2006).  <p></p>","The two main threats to the species are direct mortality caused by humans (either accidentally or deliberately) and decreasing availability of food. The main cause of unnatural death is the use of poisoned baits for predator extermination<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b), although shooting and destruction of nests also occurs<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b; N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005), and they may accidentally get caught in traps set for other predators (Zhatkanbaev 2011)<strong></strong>. Shooting and poisoning are increasing in Mongolia<em></em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, and many birds are trapped or shot in China for their feathers. There are fears that veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several <em>Gyps</em> vultures in India, may have a negative impact on <em>A. monachus</em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005; Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016)<strong></strong>, particularly as increasing numbers of the species are wintering in northern India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(T. Katzner <em>in litt. </em>2005). The recent approval for commercialisation of veterinary diclofenac in Spain may have devastating effects on European vultures - in 2020 a Cinereous Vulture was confirmed as the first individual to die from veterinary diclofenac in Europe (BirdLife 2021). A study in central Spain during 2003-2005 found high concentrations of antibiotics in blood samples from 57% of nestlings tested<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Lemus <em>et al</em>. 2008). The same study found two antibiotics in the liver samples of all dead nestlings that were tested. It is hypothesised that antibiotic residues, particularly quinolones, cause liver and kidney damage, deplete lymphoid organs and alter bacteria flora, facilitating pathogenic bacterial and fungal infections<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Lemus <em>et al</em>. 2008). The anti-inflammatory drug nimesulide, suspected to be highly toxic is also considered to be present widely across Nepal (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2018). In Europe, decreased food availability was formerly caused by European Union legislation on carcass disposal<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b), however, recently passed regulations will allow the operation of feeding stations for scavengers<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(A. Brunner <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In eastern Europe and central Asia, particularly in the former Soviet Union, changes in agricultural practices and human migration from the countryside to the cities have greatly reduced numbers of domestic livestock. In Georgia and Armenia, declines may be linked to the loss of subsidies for sheep-herding in the post-Soviet era (M. McGrady <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Additionally, there have been steep declines in many populations of wild ungulates which provide a major food source for the species. The Saiga antelope (<em>Saiga tartarica</em>), for example, numbered over one million individuals ten years ago, and has now been reduced to a population of 30,000-40,000 owing to uncontrolled hunting and severe winters (W. Fremuth <em>in litt.</em> 2005). In South Korea, food limitation is a serious problem such that the species relies on supplementary food (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong style=""""></strong>. Habitat loss is also thought to be important<strong style=""""><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004). For instance, in Portugal, there may be suitable foraging areas, but nesting sites are limited (Lourenço <em>et al. </em>2013). The majority of brood losses occur during the incubation period and it is suspected this may be partially due to low and fluctuating temperatures (Batbayar <em style="""">et al</em>. 2006) and so changes in air temperatures resulting from climate change may be a potential future threat to the species. Nest abandonment can also occur as a result of disturbance, for instance cork exploitation (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2011). Recent studies surrounding the core population of Cinereous Vultures in the Balkans (thought to be genetically distinctive and geographically isolated) also found wind farms to be a potential threat towards the species (Vasilakis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Where operational wind farms existed, collision mortality was thought to affect c. 5-11% of the core population (Vasilakis&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Low mitochondrial diversity and demographic bottlenecks were also found in Turkish populations, likely preventing population expansion (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a, b). The exact effect genetic vulnerability however requires further investigation. Due to proximity to urban areas, electric shocks and collision can further impact migratory birds, especially across the species's migration route to China (Ming 2019).<br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated to number 8,400-11,400 pairs, equating to 16,800-22,800 mature individuals, or c.&#160;25,200-34,200 individuals. This consists of 2,900-3,400 pairs in Europe (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>) and 5,500-8,000 pairs in Asia (Anon. 2004).

It was considered to occasionally breed in Portugal, North Macedonia and Albania, but no longer breed in Slovenia, Italy, Cyprus, Moldova and Romania. However, the species was seen in Romania, Italian eastern Alps, and in northern France recently, as well as being recorded in a rehabilitation center in Jordan (Bowden and Botha 2017).&#160;Recolonisation was also confirmed in Portugal following reintroduction programmes (Bowden and Botha 2017). Further monitoring is thus required to confirm its presence across south-western Europe. There are wintering areas in <strong>Sudan</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, Pakistan, north-west India, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan, Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Lao People's Democratic Republic, North Korea</strong> and <strong>South Korea</strong>. Its global population is estimated to number 8,400-11,400 pairs, with 2,900-3,400&#160;pairs in Europe<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>)<strong></strong> and 5,500-8,000<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004)<strong></strong> pairs in Asia. In Europe, populations are increasing in Spain (minimum 1,500 pairs [Barov and Derhé 2011]), Portugal and France&#160;(Barov and Derhé 2011) as well as Greece (BirdLife International 2015). Populations are&#160;stable in Macedonia<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Barov and Derhé 2011). Numbers are decreasing or fluctuating in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey and the Ukraine<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2004; Barov and Derhé 2011; BirdLife International 2015), though new nesting areas have been recently found in Turkey (Kirazli and&#160;Yamaç 2013)<strong></strong>. A recent study moreover suggests that the Turkish population (the largest in the Western Palearctic) is likely to number c. 112 individuals, existing as a single subpopulation (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a). Overall, the European population underwent a large increase between 1990 and 2000, possibly &gt;30% overall<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2004;  I. Burfield <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong> and increased from 1,330-1,874 in 1993-1996 to 1,995-2,852 in 2000-2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). The current European population trend is increasing (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).<br/><br/>Much less information is available regarding the status and population trends of the species in Asia, where the bulk of the global population resides.  There are probably over 1,000 pairs in the Asian part of Russia and a further 1,760 pairs in China<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Ye Xiao-Ti 1991). It appears that breeding populations are more or less stable in Mongolia<strong></strong> (where the species is described as common [<em></em>N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005]) and Pakistan (A. Khan, A. Parveen and R. Yasmeen <em>in litt.</em> 2005) (where it is described as scarce), although fluctuations in distribution and breeding success occur, and populations within some nature reserves in Mongolia (where there are few domestic livestock) are declining<em></em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005).  In Kazakhstan, however, populations of all vulture species are in severe decline, owing to a precipitous decline in their main food resource, the Saiga antelope (<em>Saiga tartarica</em>) (W. Fremuth <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. This trend may be mirrored in a number of other central Asian countries where populations of both domesticated livestock and wild ungulates have declined greatly in recent years<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(T. Katzner <em>in litt. </em>2005). Very little is known about population trends on its wintering grounds, although, in Nepal, wintering populations are declining in the east and possibly increasing in the west (but this may be due to better coverage) (Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016).<strong></strong>&#160;It may be increasing in India (T.

Co-operation between Spanish government agencies and conservationists under the 'Antidote Programme' also appears to have been effective in mitigating the effects of poisoned baits. Both the Spanish and the Andalusian Governments have produced anti-poisoning strategies, but the former still remain to be financially supported while the latter need more decisive official endorsement. A reintroduction project in Grands Causses, southern France has resulted in the establishment of a small breeding population (16 pairs were breeding in 2006 [Eliotout <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2007]) with good prospects.

Supplementary feeding programmes have been initiated in Spain and France to provide a safe, poison-free food source, although there are concerns that the species may be not very prone to feed at conventional feeding stations. Captive breeding populations have also been established (Tewes <em>et al.&#160;</em>1998). In the Balkans, the species has only one stable colony in the Dadia forest reserve in northern Greece, where WWF has long been involved. Supplementary food is also provided in Bulgaria for breeding birds<strong style=""""></strong> (Anon. 2007)<strong style=""""></strong> and South Korea during the winter, which may be the factor attracting birds from Mongolia (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong style=""""></strong>. In eastern Europe and central Asia, fewer conservation actions are known, although the species occurs within a number of protected areas in the region. The Balkan Vulture Action Plan aims to transfer expertise and technology relating to the conservation of the species from western to eastern parts of Europe<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b)<strong style=""""></strong>. In Nepal&#160;in 2006, a ban was introduced on the production and importation of diclofenac for veterinary use and pharmaceutical firms were encouraged to promote a safe alternative called meloxicam (Swan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The use of diclofenac has since declined by 90% across parts of Nepal; however its complete elimination from the scavenger food chain has yet to be achieved (Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).&#160;The Government of Nepal endorsed the first Vulture Conservation Action Plan (VCAP) for Nepal (2009-13), and a second was launched in 2015.&#160;Approaches&#160;include: advocating additional bans on NSAIDs; continual education programmes; continual monitoring of NSAID use; swapping diclofenac with meloxicam; collection of veterinarian pledges to stop using diclofenac; operation, maintenance and expansion of vulture-safe feeding sites. Diclofenac-free Zones have been created in 46 Districts covering a total area of 101,160 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(68.73% ) of Nepal (DNPWC 2015). Further bans are progressing on aceclofenac in Haryana, India, and ketoprofen and aceclofenac in Bangladesh and Pakistan (C.

Research threats, particularly the decline in abundance of prey species. Carry out reintroductions to link up the western and the eastern sub-areas of the present range, following the recommendations of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Black Vulture Conservation Foundation; possibly focusing on releasing immature individuals rather than juveniles because they can breed earlier and so lead to faster settlement and breeding in the wild (Mihoub <em>et al. </em>2014). Develop the captive breeding programme to support both this and future reintroduction and supplementation efforts. Restore wild rabbit <em style="""">Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> populations in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands (Spain) as this may help to increase food availability, particularly during the breeding period. Promote cooperation and information exchange among people working on the species, both at a national and international level. Remove drugs like diclofenac and other harmful NSAIDs from the environment and control the illicit use of human diclofenac for veterinary purpose (H. S. Baral and C. Inskipp&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Strengthen and enforce legislation regulating trade in pesticides that are used to poison meat baits. Increase the rate of prosecution and the severity of judicial sentences for illegal poisoning. Protect appropriate breeding habitat (e.g. Moreno-Opo <em>et al. </em>2013). Investigate the extent to which operational wind farms could affect major breeding populations such as core populations in the Balkans (Vasilakis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Provide effective protection to the Turkish population (the largest in the Western Palearctic), specifically during breeding seasons and investigate impact of demographic bottlenecks and low genetic diversity (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a, b). At the European level, to prevent ecological barriers, stronger integration is needed in environmental policies across political borders (Arrondo <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/>The European Species Action Plan for the Conservation of the Cinereous Vulture (2017) provides a comprehensive overview of the conservation and research actions necessary to conserve this species in Europe (Andevski <em>et al. </em>2017). In addition to the above, the plan recommends: reintroducing or restoring wild ungulate populations; increasing the monitoring of poisoning of vultures; improving legal measures to reduce poisoning incidents; banning lead ammunition; and raising public awareness of the risks to Cinereous Vultures and the positives of maintaining vulture populations.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The recent decline may be part of a longer-term fluctuation and the population should be monitored carefully to ascertain whether it shows signs of stabilising.,"The species breeds on coastal saltmarshes, sand and shingle beaches, dunes, cliff-tops with short grass and occasionally rocky shores, as well as inland along the shores of lakes, reservoirs and rivers or on agricultural grass and cereal fields, often some distance from water (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species is chiefly coastal, frequenting estuarine mudflats, saltmarshes and sandy and rocky shores (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground often on raised surfaces (e.g. earth banks) in the open or in short vegetation on cultivated or uncultivated land, cliff-tops, rocky outcrops or clearings in taller vegetation including woods and moorland (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996,&#160;Snow &amp;&#160;Perrins 1998).<br/><br/>Most populations of this species are fully migratory, inland breeders moving to the coast for the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds from April to July (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) in solitary pairs or small groups (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), during the winter foraging singly or in small groups of up to 10 individuals (Snow &amp; Perrins 1998) and with larger flocks often forming in major bays and estuaries and at roosting sites (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow &amp; Perrins 1998). When foraging on soft intertidal substrates bivalves and gastropods are the most important food items for this species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Polychaetes and crustaceans are more important in estuaries however, and molluscs (e.g. mussels, limpets and whelks) are most important on rocky shores (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). When inland, prey such as earthworms and insect larvae (e.g. caterpillars and cranefly larvae) are also taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The main threat to the species is the over-fishing of benthic shellfish and the resulting disappearance of intertidal mussel and cockle beds (Atkinson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Verhulst <em>et al.</em> 2004, Ens 2006, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Bait digging has also been identified as a threat through loss of prey species and disturbance to the benthic fauna (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is also threatened by habitat degradation on its wintering grounds due to land reclamation (for example in the Yellow Sea [Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014]), pollution, human disturbance (Kelin &amp; Qiang 2006) (e.g. from construction work or recreational activities [Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014]), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006), industrial development including development of ports and oil extraction, oil spills, wind farms (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014) and reduced river flows (Kelin &amp; Qiang 2006). Rapid and extensive land reclamation is reported from staging and wintering grounds for the <em>osculans</em> population in South Korea and China and large-scale planting of <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> on the coast of eastern China may cause loss of foraging and nesting habitats (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014). Intensive agriculture including frequent mowing of grasslands and high densities of grazing livestock threatens chicks, eggs and nests and high levels of fertilizers and pesticides can reduce soil invertebrate biomass (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). A reduction in eutrophication is likely to have contributed to declines in some areas, owing to a loss of food resources (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014, H. Meltofte <em>in litt</em>. 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Sea level rise leading to increased coastal erosion and flooding is contributing to habitat loss in some areas (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Climate change has advanced the average egg-laying date of the species and is likely to reduce recruitment of bivalves, however warmer winters are expected to benefit the species leading to lower winter mortality (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Droughts in some inland areas are likely to lead to a loss of suitable habitat (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sarychev &amp; Mischenko 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is hunted in France but the effects of hunting at the population level are not known (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). It may be subject to subsistence egg collection in China (Melville <em>et al</em>, 2014) and illegal hunting elsewhere (Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014). Eggs and chicks are known to be predated by Corvidae, gulls, American Mink&#160;<em>Neovison vison</em>, dogs and foxes&#160;<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>&#160;(Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014).&#160;The invasive Pacific Oyster <em>Crassostrea gigas</em> has become abundant in the Oosterschelde (Netherlands) and is increasing in the Dutch Wadden Sea (van de Pol et al. 2014). Eurasian Oystercatcher generally does not eat this species of oyster which is reported to be invading mussel beds and may compete with cockles and mussels thus reducing food availability. However Pacific Oyster beds could also provide an area for mussel beds to re-establish. The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville &amp;&#160;Shortridge 2006).<br/><br/>In the northern part of the <em>longipes</em> population breeding range, cessation of grazing in coastal areas leading to development of shrubby vegetation threatens breeding habitats (Sarychev and Mischenko 2014). Conversely, intensive grazing in some areas may pose a threat to this population. Pollution from sewage, heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides have been identified as potential threats for the&#160;<em>osculans&#160;</em>population (Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).","The global   population is estimated to number c. 925,000-1,030,000 individuals, based on expert opinion (Wetlands   International 2019), and comprising the three separate subspecies of <em>H. o. ostralegus</em>&#160;(820,000),&#160;<em>H. o.&#160;longpipes</em>&#160;(100,000-200,000) and <em>H. o. osculans</em>&#160;(5,000-10,000; Wetlands International 2019). This is roughly equivalent to 616,667-686,667 mature individuals, here placed in the band 500,000-999,999 mature individuals. Population estimates are lower than those of recent assessments due to the recent taxonomic split, whereby <em>Haematopus finschi</em>&#160;(South Island Oystercatcher), previously considered a subspecies of <em>Haematopus ostralegus</em>&#160;(del Hoyo <em>et. al.</em> 2014), was designated a separate species.",Decreasing,"The species has a wide range comprising three flyway populations. <em>H. o. ostralegus</em> breeds from <strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Scandinavia</strong> east to north-west&#160;<strong>Russia</strong>, south through <strong>U.K.</strong> to north-west <strong>France</strong>, with isolated populations in the Mediterranean, and winters on coasts south to West Africa. <em>H. o. longipes</em> breeds from west and central Russia south to the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas, and east to western Siberia, and winters on coasts from East Africa through Arabia to <strong>India</strong>; <em>H. o. osculans</em> breeds from coastal north-east Russia through Manchuria to the west and south coasts of the Korean Peninsula south to Fujian province, <strong>China</strong>, and winters in eastern China and along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula (more than 50% of the population is thought to winter at just one site, Yubu Island, <strong>South Korea </strong>and a further 25% are thought to winter at Lianyunggang, Jiangsu, China; Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>H. o. ostralegus</em>&#160;is not significantly exploited by human populations. Across most of its distribution, the species is legally protected and has not been hunted since the mid-1980s however, hunting remains a major source of mortality for <em>ostralegus</em>&#160;throughout France (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Between 1993-99, between 1,800-2,000 (mild winters) and 8,000-17,000 (severe winters where birds wintered in France to avoid more northerly locations) were shot per year (Trolliet 2000, Triplet 2000).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The species is listed on Annex II (B) of the EU Birds Directive.

There is also evidence that the creation of large marine protected areas (MPAs) to protect this species from the threat of anthropogenic shellfish over-fishing may not be an effective management or conservation technique on a global scale, especially if over-fishing continues to occur in adjacent areas (Verhulst&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Limit human activities in some areas to prevent disturbance (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Limit hunting in France when cold weather pushes large numbers of birds into France (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Increase awareness of the species. Support traditional farming methods that benefit the species in the range of the&#160;<em>longipes</em>&#160;population (Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014).<br/><br/>Monitor populations at wintering and breeding areas throughout its range, and record breeding success.

Identify stopover sites and wintering areas for the&#160;<em>longipes</em>&#160;population (Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014). Assess impacts of land reclamation on the species in South Korea and China (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014). Further research is needed to investigate the cause of declines in areas such as Germany and Denmark, to model the potential effects of climate change on the species, assess the impact of human disturbance and to look at population dynamics (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Whilst the population displays a small decreasing trend, the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The South Island Oystercatcher predominantly occurs in coastal and freshwater wetland environments but has been known to utilise anthropogenically-modified environments including farmland and pastures (Robertson <em>et al</em>. 2007). During the non-breeding season, <em>Haematopus finschi</em> occurs predominantly on sandy, muddy and gravel intertidal mudflats and beaches throughout the estuaries, harbours and coastlines of the North Island (Marchant &amp; Higgins 1993) however, high tides and or bad weather can force individuals to seek safer sites in neighbouring grassy paddocks and farmland (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). During the breeding season, South Island Oystercatchers utilise inland gravel-bed rivers, gravel beaches of lakes and farmland, often moving to higher elevations to breed above the tree-line in subalpine tundra and wetlands (Marchant &amp; Higgins 1993, Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014).","Human populations have generated a significant and diverse array of threats to <em>Haematopus finschi</em> in New Zealand. The introduction of alien species to the New Zealand islands has resulted in the increased predation of South Island Oystercatchers by invasive mammalian predators, a reduction in food and roosting space availability in wintering areas and an invasion of river bed nesting areas by tall, alien vegetation (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Whilst hunting led to a significant reduction in South Island Oystercatcher populations pre-1940, subsequent protection has removed this threat (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Land use change and urban expansion threaten breeding, roosting and feeding sites, with food availability further reduced by the commercial-scale mechanical harvest of cockles in intertidal areas, such as the Golden and Tasman Bays (Schmechel 2001, Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Pollution of harbour areas poses a further threat to the Southern Oystercatcher, evidenced by lead concentrations being 146% higher in Oystercatchers sampled at the urban Manukau harbour compared to the rural Kaipara harbour (Thompson &amp; Dowding 1999). Large-scale development of wind farms in coastal regions has the potential to increase mortality of Oystercatchers on migration or commuting between roosts and feeding areas (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Climate change presents a further threat, both through the reduction in intertidal area available for the waders to feed brought about by sea level rise and the reduction in prey species density stemming from a change in rainfall intensity patterns (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014).","The population size was estimated to be 112,675 individuals in 1983-94 (Sagar <em>et al</em>. 1999). Numbers are thought to have increased for a few years after this, after which they declined, possibly back to the 1988 level (Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). The population is therefore suspected to be c.113,000, roughly equivalent to 75,333 mature individuals, here placed in the band 50,000-99,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The South Island Oystercatcher undergoes annual migration between the North and South Islands of <strong>New Zealand</strong>, the country to which it is endemic (Marchant and Higgins 1993). The majority of the population breed inland on the South Island, mainly east of the Southern Alps, up to 1800 m a.s.l., with small numbers breeding in North Island's Hawkes Bay and southern Wairarapa since the 1980s (Marchant &amp; Higgins, 1993; Robertson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sagar &amp; Veitch 2014). Non-breeding individuals are spread throughout New Zealand's coastal regions with 68% of the non-breeding population found in the northern half of the North Island, predominantly in harbour and estuarine settings (Marchant &amp; Higgins 1993, Robertson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, Sagar &amp; Veitch, 2014).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Oceanian,,false,false,Global

It occurs on plateaus or gentle slopes with montane tundra in the subarctic at heights of 300-1,600 m (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In its wintering range the species occurs in sheltered coastal habitats such as inlets, bays, harbours, estuaries and lagoons with large intertidal mud and sandflats, oceanic sandy beaches with nearby mudflats (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, sandy spits and islets, muddy shorelines with mangroves and occasionally exposed reefs or rock platforms (Higgins and Davies 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

Up to 65% of intertidal habitat in the Yellow Sea has been lost  over the past 50 years with habitat loss estimated at a rate of &gt;1% annually (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). Losses are attributed to reclamation for agriculture,  aquaculture, and other development and are expected to continue or accelerate owing to population growth around the Yellow Sea. Degradation and loss of wetland habitats in the Yellow Sea region are also attributed to environmental pollution (Kelin and Qiang 2006)<strong></strong> (e.g. oil contamination of intertidal mudflats) (Tomkovich 1997)<strong></strong>, reduced river flows and human disturbance (Kelin and Qiang 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong> (e.g. from off-road vehicles, tourists and hunters) (Tomkovich 1997)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>In South Korea, after the loss of the important Saemangeum stopover area and almost all of the tidal-flats in Asan Bay and much of Namyang bay, possibly only five sites nationwide remain internationally important. Of these, only one (the Geum Estuary) currently has a low risk of reclamation, with the other four at risk due to the construction of tidal power plants and barrages, industrial use and urban expansion (N. Moores <em>in litt.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. Benthic food stocks used by the species reportedly crashed at Yalujiang NNR, Liaoning in 2014 and 2015 (D. Melville <em>in litt</em>. 2015). In 2015, most birds departed Yalujiang and moved to northern Bohai, however, it seems unlikely that this site will exist in five years time, owing to extensive reclamation works (D. Melville <em>in litt</em>. 2015). In the Philippines, India and Australia other threats may include mangrove afforestation, habitat degradation caused by intense fishing activities and harvesting of molluscs and bivalves,&#160;infrastructure projects, aquaculture, oil spills and invasive alien plant species (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is also potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its global distribution is restricted to within c. 10<sup>o</sup> latitude from the polar edge of continent and within which 20-50% of current vegetation type is projected to disappear under doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> levels (BirdLife International unpublished data)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","The global   population was estimated to number c. 380,000 individuals in 2006 (Wetlands   International 2006). However following the reclamation of the tidal flats at   Saemanguem (South Korea), c. 90,000 non-breeding individuals disappeared from the area.   Surveys elsewhere in South Korea confirmed they had not been displaced, and a   decline of the same magnitude and timing in Australia suggests that   individuals previously using Saemanguem have died (D. Rogers in litt. 2009).   Therefore a new global population was estimated at 292,000-295,000 individuals in 2007 (Wetlands International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species breeds in north-east Siberia, <strong>Russia</strong>, wintering mainly in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia,</span> but also throughout the coastline of South-East Asia and on the coasts of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India, Bangladesh, Pakistan</span>, and the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. The Yellow Sea of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">North Korea, South Korea </span>and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span> is a particularly important stop-over site on migration in both spring and autumn. The Yalu Jiang coastal wetland in the north Yellow Sea has been identified as a key site for the species during northward migration (Choi <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is thought that the southern Yellow Sea is used as a temporary stopover area whilst the northern Yellow Sea acts as a key staging site where birds refuel (Ma <em>et al</em>. 2013).

The species’s breeding sites are poorly-known. It has been considered likely to breed in the coastal desert of southern Peru and northern Chile (Brooke 2004, Carboneras <em>et al. </em>2019), and the species’s at-sea distribution and observations of grounded birds have indicated that it nests between 20° and 25°S in Chile and in Peru (Murillo <em>et al.</em> 2013). Since no large colonies have been found, it has been speculated that the species breeds in ‘small, scattered groups’ (Brooke 2004). Individuals have been reported inland at Caraz, Peru, c.100 km from the coast and at an altitude of 2,250 m (Gardner 1986 in Brooke 2004) and in the Peruvian Andes from Huaraz to Arequipa, at altitudes of 2,300-3,400 m (Murillo <em>et al. </em>2013).

The breeding cavities were located in outcrops of gypsum in an area of pampa, and the authors noted that the breeding area could be much larger than that discovered, based on the large area of similar habitat that was not surveyed (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2018). Further surveys of the same breeding colony in 2018 estimated a population of 7,919 pairs in an area of 129.1 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Medrano <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).

The population is considered to be in decline due to various threats, but the rate of decline is not known. The species is therefore classified as Near Threatened. <br/><p></p>","Markham’s Storm-petrel breeds in dispersed colonies in saline areas, using fissures and holes created by saltpetre deposits for nesting (Tobias <em>et al</em>. 2006, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Paracas, the species breeds in small, dispersed colonies up to 5 km from the sea on sloping ground<strong> </strong>(Tobias <em>et al. </em>2006). The colonies in Chile are located on the east of the Cordillera de la Costa mountain range at up to 50 km distance from the sea (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). In Chile, known colonies are located at 600-1,100 m a.s.l. (Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). Reproduction can be asynchronous within a colony (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Nevertheless, in the northern colonies in Paracas, near Arica and in Salar de Quiuña, most pairs lay eggs between April and August, and are with chicks between July and January (Jahnke 1994, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). Pairs breeding in the colonies of Pampa Perdiz, Salar Grande and Salar de Navidad further south lay eggs between November and January, while chicks hatch between January and April (Malinarich <em>et al</em>. 2018, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). The species feeds opportunistically both inshore and offshore on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (Garcia-Godos <em>et al. </em>2002). Adults arrive at the colonies at least 45 min after sunset (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p></p>","The principle threat faced by Markham’s Storm-petrel is the mining of saltpetre from the salt plain on which it nests (Torres-Mura and Lemus 2013, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). This has resulted in the loss of considerable amounts of breeding habitat, as it destroys the burrows and crevices in which nests are placed (Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Light pollution also represents a significant level of mortality, with 10-20 fresh corpses reported each morning next to a single light close to a breeding colony (Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is assumed that fledglings are attracted to the lights of nearby cities during their first flights (Torres-Mura and Lemus 2013, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015), and already few, strong light sources may affect large parts of a breeding colony (F. Medrano <em>in litt</em>. 2019). It has been estimated that each year around 20,000 fledglings die because of light pollution, representing 1/3 of the entire cohort (F. Medrano <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Light-pollution was found to be a severe threat to seabirds and Hydrobatidae in particular, which can potentially have a detrimental effect on the overall population size (Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further threats include infrastructure developments (roads, wind farms and power lines), military exercises and garbage (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Overall, given the severity of the threats presented by mining and light pollution and their potentially detrimental impacts on the population size, the number of locations of occurrence (as defined by the most severe threat) is assumed to be relatively small.<br/><p></p>","A minimum of 2,305 pairs were present on the Paracas peninsula in 1992<strong> </strong>(Tobias <em>et al. </em>2006).

Between July and September, it is found over warm, equatorial waters, while between January and July it moves to cooler waters of the Peru Current and further west (Pyle 1993, Spear and Ainley 2007). It breeds on the Paracas peninsula on the coast of central <strong>Peru </strong>and in the Atacama Desert of southern Peru and northern <strong>Chile </strong>(Carboneras 1992, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019).

There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008). The preponderance of amphibian species in the highlands are <em>Pseudophilautus</em><em> </em>shrub frogs which, being direct developers, are independent of bodies of standing water. Instead, they depend on the ambient moisture of the forest for both homeostasis and reproduction. Highland aridification and warming therefore, are serious—if as yet unassessed—potential threats to these species. In the southwestern lowland portions of this species’ range, there does not appear to be a negative rainfall trend. However, warming is predicted to result in reduced surface moisture. While the southwest monsoon rainy period (May-July) is gradually becoming longer, the first intermonsoon (March-April) is yielding less rain, delaying the onset of the rains that follow the December-February dry season. The extended dry period has obvious consequences for non-aquatic amphibians such as the direct-developing<em> </em><em>Pseudophilautus</em>. In both regions, the combination of warming and extended dry periods increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests).</span></span>","This species is uncommon across its range.

It relies heavily on soaring flight, and has been shown to fly at altitudes of 10,000 m and higher. Birds hunt alone but congregate at food sources and roosts; they also tend to migrate singly, but concentrations (usually up to 15 individuals) form at sea crossings and strong thermals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>It is a species of expansive open areas in a wide array of environments, from mountains to semi-desert, and is recorded regularly from sea level up to c.3,000&#160;m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>It feeds almost exclusively on carrion, mainly that of large mammals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is usually built on a rocky outcrop, with sheltered ledges or small caves preferred (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Effective protection in areas with a plentiful supply of food (which often includes the carrion of domestic animals), has been shown to catalyse impressive population recoveries, and reintroduction has been successful in parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","It declined markedly throughout the 19th–20th centuries in much of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, mainly due to direct persecution and ""bycatch"" from the poisoned carcasses set for livestock predators (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Direct persecution has decreased, although it may still be a threat in eastern Europe, Central Asia and possibly the Middle East (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). Unintentional poisoning through poison bates remains the most significant threat to the species (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017) - during 2000-2010 2,146 Griffon Vultures were found poisoned in Spain (RSPB 2014). In some areas a reduction in available food supplies, arising from changes in livestock management practices, also had an impact (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012) and electrocution has been identified as a threat (Global Raptors Information Network 2015). Disturbance caused by visitors may also pose a threat in some areas (Choresh <em>et al. </em>2019). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used for veterinary purposes pose a threat to this species. One case of suspected poisoning caused by flunixin, an NSAID, was recorded in this species in 2012 in Spain (Zorrilla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015), and several more have occurred since (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2020). Diclofenac, a similar NSAID which has caused severe declines in&#160;<em>Gyps</em>&#160;vulture species across Asia, was authorised for veterinary use in Spain in 2013. Diclofenac was detected in livestock carcasses in the Iberian Peninsula between 2013 and 2019 (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2020), and in 2021 the first case of a vulture death in Europe due to ingestion of Diclofenac was confirmed (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;<p>There were widespread declines in the population of Griffon vultures throughout Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula during the 20th century (Carneiro <em>et al</em>. 2015). This is a result of the species ingesting toxins from the carcasses they feed on, which accumulate in their system and increase mortality rates. Most of the carcasses the species feeds on are high in toxins as they came through livestock management or hunting practises; lead bullet fragments are often ingested leading to a build-up of toxic levels of lead within the species. This was worsened in 2001 when the EU legislated against the disposal of livestock carcasses in the field to curb the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. This lowered food availability and forced some vultures to seek out food in areas including garbage dumps, where they risk ingesting further heavy metals. In an analysis of 121 wild vultures sampled on the Iberian Peninsula, every individual had lead present in its blood, ranging in concentration from 4.97 to 300.23 μg/dl. The declines are further worsened by the intentional, and illegal, poisoning of Griffon vultures, the largest cause of non-natural mortality in large birds of prey (Carneiro <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>","The European population is estimated at 34,800-44,700 pairs, which equates to 69,600-89,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).

The pre-1990 EOO was 258,634 km<sup>2</sup> and the post-1990 EOO is 65,231 km<sup>2</sup>, a reduction of 75%. These figures are calculated from the Atlas of Living Australia dataset, after eliminating obvious distributional errors. The reduction in area of occupancy (AOO) likely mirrors this decline, but there is no accurate national dataset to allow calculation of historic AOO with confidence. The current AOO is 492 km<sup>2</sup>. This population decline is likely to also extend into the future (Criterion A3c) as existing populations are now generally small, fragmented, and recent experience suggests that many populations suffered significantly during the recent Millennium Drought in southeastern Australia (Lintermans <em>et al.</em> 2014) with drought and other climatic extremes (severe storms) predicted to become more frequent under climate change. Such declines in abundance and distribution are unlikely to be reversible. The population is now considered severely fragmented.<br/><br/>The impact on Macquarie Perch from the the Epizootic Haematopoietic&#160;Necrosis virus (EHNV), carried by alien species such as Redfin Perch (<em>Perca fluviatlis</em>) and Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) has also been shown to cause dramatic mortality of Macquarie Perch under laboratory conditions and is suspected of involvement in the extirpation of some populations (e.g. Lake Eildon) (Langdon 1989). Once EHNV is in a catchment, it is virtually impossible to eradicate. Redfin Perch have also been directly associated with declines of Macquarie Perch in New South Wales (Lachlan River catchment) with predation of juveniles the likely mechanism of impact (Gilligan <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/><br/>Based on this information, a population reduction of 50% is inferred over the past three generations (42 years). Based on this population reduction and the restricted distribution, this species is therefore assessed as Endangered.","This species now inhabits cool, clear water of rivers, lakes and reservoirs, demonstrating a preference for slow-flowing deep rocky pools.&#160;Males are reported to reach sexual maturity at two years of age and ~210 mm total length, and females at three years and 300 mm, but ripe males have been recorded at ~120 mm (Lintermans 2007). Maximum known age is 30 years and in a reservoir population 25% of spawning fish were 15-30 years old (Tonkin<em> et al. </em>2018)&#160;but most riverine individuals would be expected to be less than 15-18 years old. Spawning occurs from October to December with fish migrating from lakes to tributaries to spawn (Cadwallader&#160;and Rogan 1977,&#160;<span style="""">Tonkin <em>et al. </em>2018</span>). Spawning is either at the foot of pools with eggs drifting downstream to lodge amongst gravel and cobble in riffles; or spawning is directly in riffles. Adults are largely crepuscular and nocturnal occupying well defined homesites during the day (Thiem <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160;<span style="""">Koster <em>et al. </em>2014</span>).","<p>Major threats include habitat loss and modification, overfishing (legal and illegal), impacts of alien fish species (competition, predation) and likely a viral disease (Epizootic Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (EHNV)) largely spread/magnified by Redfin Perch (Lintermans 2007, 2013).&#160;In particular,&#160;alterations to hydrology (river regulation and water extraction and cold-water pollution), loss of connectivity between populations and habitats (dams and barriers), and changes to land use (riparian vegetation loss and&#160;sedimentation)&#160;have resulted in highly fragmented populations which have effectively isolated Macquarie Perch among waterways (Pavlova <em>et al. </em>2017, Tonkin <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;The restricted distribution and now&#160;isolation of riverine populations, which largely occur in headwaters and tributary systems make&#160;the few remaining&#160;remnant riverine populations particularly vulnerable to episodic disturbance events including extreme drought, floods and sedimentation (Tonkin <em>et al. </em>2017). Such isolation has also resulted in loss of genetic diversity possibly reducing their adaptive potential to habitat changes associated with&#160;climate change (Pavlova <em>et al.</em> 2017) making future adaptation to continuing threats less likely. Changed fire management practices as a result of extensive uncontrollable bushfires has resulted in increased hazard-reduction burn frequency, and an inability to control such burns in mountainous and remote locations results in burning to the waterline, followed by subsequent sedimentation of critical habitats (spawning riffles and refuge pools).&#160;</p><p>Populations in impoundments are susceptible to relatively rapid and catastrophic collapses, often to extinction (Lintermans 2012).&#160;The populations of Macquarie Perch in Dartmouth and Eildon reservoirs in Victoria and Lake Burrinjuck in New South Wales initially supported significant recreational fisheries (Cadwallader and Rogan 1977). There are also anecdotal reports of good populations in Tantangara Reservoir in New South Wales (Trueman 2011), with this population now extirpated. All of these impoundment populations have declined dramatically, with the species now effectively extirpated from Eildon, Burrinjuck and Tantangara. The species did not survive the impoundment of the Queanbeyan River to form Googong Reservoir in New South Wales, with existing spawning habitat flooded by the new impoundment and a natural barrier (waterfall) preventing access to spawning habitats upstream of the new impoundment. An emergency translocation was required to allow fish to access suitable spawning habitat upstream of Googong Reservoir, but the re-established population subsequently failed during the Millenium Drought (1997-2010) (Lintermans 2013). The enlargement of the Cotter Reservoir in the ACT resulted in a similar disruption to spawning migrations between the reservoir and the stream, with existing spawning habitats flooded and instream barriers (exacerbated by low flow conditions as a result of an upstream impoundment) blocking access to new spawning sites (Broadhurst <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Additionally, interactions with alien species such as trout and Redfin Perch have exposed this species to Epizootic Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (EHNV, carried by Redfin Perch). Proposed pumped-hydro schemes pose a significant risk of transferring EHNV and Redfin Perch from the upper Tumut system to the upper Murrumbidgee subpopulation in the future. Habitat modification, clearing of riparian vegetation, constructions of dams and weirs act as barriers to migration and recolonisation and cold water discharges from dams can prevent successful breeding in this species. Illegal fishing and unwitting harvest as a result of mis-identification remains a threat to this species.</p>","There are no robust population estimates for subpopulations. This species has experienced population declines in recent decades due to habitat loss and modification, overfishing, impacts of alien fish species and probably a viral disease introduced by Redfin Perch (Lintermans 2007, 2013).&#160;In particular,&#160;alterations to hydrology (river regulation and extraction), connectivity (dams and barriers), and land use (riparian and&#160;sedimentation)&#160;have resulted in highly fragmented populations which have effectively isolated Macquarie Perch among waterways (Pavlova <em>et al. </em>2017, Tonkin <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;Populations in impoundments are susceptible to relatively rapid and catastrophic collapses, often to extinction (Lintermans 2012), and such collapses have occurred in Lake Burrinjuck, Tantangara Reservoir, Googong Reservoir in NSW, and Lake Eildon in Victoria. Other populations in lowland habitats such as the mid-lower Murray have disappeared since the mid-1900s, and the Macquarie River population (type locality) is extinct. Several viable subpopulations have been lost in the last 10-15 years including Goodradigbee River/Burrinjuck, Queanbeyan River. Lachlan River, and the Broken River is now unlikely to be viable in the long-term. However, two subpopulations outside the natural range resulting from historical translocations are well established (Yarra River in Victoria, Cataract Reservoir in NSW) (Pavlova<em> et al. </em>2017) and a population in the Mongarlowe River persists, with very low recruitment after collapsing in the 1980s/1990s (Lintermans 2008).",Decreasing,"This species is native to the Murray-Darling Basin in southeastern Australia where it is currently found in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory (Lintermans 2007). It was historically occasionally recorded in the lower reaches of the Murray River in South Australia and the Macquarie River in New South Wales, but it is no longer present there. Within its current natural range it is generally now restricted to the upper reaches of the catchments, often only occupying tributaries of major rivers&#160;where natural flow and temperature regimes remain and riparian zones are intact. It is considered that there are 12 subpopulations occurring:&#160;Cotter River (ACT); Upper Murrumbidgee River; Mannus Creek; Adjungbilly Creek; Retreat River/Abercrombie River (NSW);&#160; Lake Dartmouth/upper Mitta Mitta River; Hughes Creek; King Parrot Creek; Hollands Creek; Sevens Creek; Yea River; and upper Buffalo River (VIC). Several viable subpopulations have been lost in the last 10-15 years including Goodradigbee River/Burrinjuck, Queanbeyan River; Lachlan River; and the Broken River; and possibly Mannus Creek and Adjungbilly Creek are now unlikely to be viable in the long-term. The historical oral history research of Trueman (2011) records the species in many more localities than it is currently found, with many of these localities not represented in scientific databases.

For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.<p></p>","This species is found in dense vine tangles in riparian thickets and forest undergrowth near water (frequently in seasonally flooded areas and oxbow lakes). It is dependent on habitats generated by the cycle of flooding and ebbing of the rivers (D. Lima <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). Feeds individually, in pairs, or in small family groups on a variety of invertebrate prey (Olmos <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). Forages in thick vegetation but occasionally pursues flushed prey in flight (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2003). Breeds from May to July (Crozariol 2011).","Its specialised habitat requirements make the species susceptible to changes in hydrological management. The greatest threat to the species is the development of hydroelectrocity projects (HPP), which are likely to flood large parts of the species's habitat (Brasil Choueri&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Dornas and Pinheira 2018, D. Lima&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). The Estreito Hydro-Power Complex was recently constructed in the Tocantins-Araguaia river basin and within the species's range (T. Dornas&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020), going into operation in 2012. The reservoir of this project reaches between Estreito (Maranhão) and Palmeirante (Tocantins; Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). Two hydroelectrical plants projects are currently in progress within the species's range: HPP Marabá (Pará) and HPP Santa Isabel&#160;(Tocantins). HPP Marabá is projected to produce a reservoir that will reach the dam of HPP Santa Isabel on the Araguai River, and HPP Serra Quebrada in Itaguatins (PAC 2018). HPP Santa Isabel is planned for the region of the Rapids of Santa Isabel, and the reservoir is projected to reach&#160;Araguanã (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). There are plans to construct two further hydroelectrical plants (HPP) within the species's range by 2025: HPP Araguanã and HPP Serra Quebrada, both in Tocantins, but the plans are currently on hold and they are not expected to be constructed within the next 5-10 years (T. Dornas&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;HPP Araguanã is projected to create a reservoir that will come close to&#160;Araguacema, and HPP Serra Quebrada will dam&#160; the Tocantins river, with a reservoir reaching HPP Estreito (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). If all the planned hydroelectricity projects are executed, they may alter almost 500 km of river for each of the two major rivers affected (D.

This and its virtual disappearance from agricultural lowlands make it highly reliant on protected areas in its core breeding range.<p></p>","It is a species of cool, dry-country, frequenting coastal and montane fynbos<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2004, R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>, highland grasslands, Karoo subdesert scrub, open plains with low shrubs and croplands. It often breeds close to coastal and upland marshes with tall shrubs or reeds, occurring in dry steppe and grassland areas further north in the non-breeding season (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Thiollay 1994, R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. In the Western Cape of South Africa it is most abundant in coastal and montane fynbos<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>, whilst in Namibia it favours coastal river floodplains<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(S. Braine and J. Paterson <em>per</em> Simmons 2005)<strong></strong>. It prefers open ground with low vegetation for hunting, where it feeds on a diet comprising mainly of small mammals, especially <em>Otomys </em>and <em>Rhabdomys</em> species  (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. Whilst mammals make up the vast majority of prey taken at coastal sites (and this remains consistent throughout the breeding season [García-Heras <em>et al. </em>2017]), birds make up a slightly greater proportion than mammals in the diet of pairs nesting in montane habitats (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2004), although individuals breeding at inland sites start the breeding season with a similar diet to those at coastal sites and as the season progresses their diet shifts to fewer mammals and more birds and reptiles (García-Heras <em>et al. </em>2017). Local fluctuations in breeding numbers may be related to population cycles in its prey base, such as mice whose numbers fluctuate with rainfall, especially in the more arid regions (Thiollay 1994, R.E. Simmons<em> in litt</em>. 2007, see also García-Heras <em>et al. </em>2016, 2017). Damp sites, near vleis, marshes or streams, are preferred for breeding (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong></strong>, while south-facing slopes are preferred in montane areas (R.E. Simmons<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Nests are built on the ground and usually hold three to five eggs (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2004, R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. In south-western South Africa, egg-laying takes place in June-November, with peaks in July and September (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. After breeding, females appear to migrate to higher elevations, while the males stay closer to the breeding grounds (Anderson 2013). There appears to be a lack of genetic variation within the species, which while uncommon, is not unique (Fuchs <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><p></p>","The species has conceivably lost 50% of its preferred breeding habitat over the last century (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and present rates of loss in the Overberg may be over 1% per annum (R.E. Simmons<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Habitat is primarily lost to agriculture, and this is compounded by the uncontrolled burning of fynbos and grassland, which renders these habitats unsuitable for breeding for about five years (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Alien vegetation and urbanisation are also cited as causes of habitat loss (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In south-western South Africa, it is thought that breeding birds have been displaced from prime lowland habitats (renosterveld and fynbos) by the spread of cereal agriculture, with breeding pairs presently occupying only coastal areas, with high productivity, and montane habitats, where breeding success is low and levels of nest predation are high (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is particularly vulnerable to nest predation because it nests on the ground (see Lee and Simmons 2014). Rodent populations in areas of wheat cultivation may be as low as 33% of those found in renosterveld vegetation (R.E. Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and remnant patches of renosterveld, which continue to be degraded (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, hold lower numbers of rodents than coastal strandveld vegetation (R.E. Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <br/><br/>Low hatching rates, possibly as a result of high pesticide residues, is an increasing threat now that many remaining breeding habitats are surrounded by agricultural areas (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The ingestion of herbicides and pesticides may account for the death of some adults in South Africa (Simmons 2005). Persistent organocholorines, which were found in blood samples from South African birds, may cause physical stress and reduced immunity at higher blood concentrations (Garcia-Heras et al. 2017b). Road deaths adjacent to west coast breeding grounds also numbered six birds over one breeding season in 2007 (R.E. Simmons<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Drainage, impoundment and inappropriate management of vleis, marshes or streams near breeding grounds could prove detrimental. Climate change in South Africa is predicted to cause a decrease in overall winter rainfall in the core breeding areas, which is likely to lead to a reduction in mouse populations and disruption to breeding (R.E. Simmons<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The same threats may apply to the species in Namibia, and the favoured habitats of the migrant population may be overgrazed, particularly in southern Namibia (Simmons 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <br/><br/>Overgrazing in southern Namibia is attributed mainly to resident pastoralists and 'emergency grazing' by farmers from elsewhere, which is offered during years of good rainfall (R.E. Simmons<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Assessments carried out between 2016-2019 found wind farms to be a major threat to Black Harriers, with a mortality rate of 1.5 birds per year at some farms (R.E Simmons, 2019, <em>pers. comm</em>.,). Initial results from a PVA underway by Cervantes <em>et al., (in prep)</em> suggest that if&#160;an average of three birds were killed per year by wind farms in South Africa the population would collapse in about 100 years, while if five&#160;birds were killed per year by wind farms in South Africa the population would collapse in less than 75 years.<br/><p></p>","The total population is estimated at &lt;1,000 individuals in South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini (Taylor 2015) with only c.10 mature individuals outside this region (Taylor 2015; &lt;50 individuals of all ages in Namibia [Simmons<em>&#160;</em>2015]).

It may also occur in cereal fields outside the breeding season (Suárez <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is found from 50-1,880 m but mainly over 1,000 m. It feeds on the ground on insects and seeds. Breeding takes place in March-July (Herranz <em>et al. </em>1994, Perez-Granados <em>et al</em>. 2017b). Breeding in the North African populations starts earlier, at the end of January-February.&#160;<p></p>","In parts of its range, overgrazing or undergrazing and agricultural development have caused a reduction in its preferred habitats and a considerable decrease in numbers (M. Smart<em> in litt</em>. 2004,&#160;Isenmann&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Traba <em>et al.</em> 2019). Reforestation schemes also lead to a loss of suitable habitat and infrastructure development has led to fragmentation of habitat, particularly by the construction and development of windfarms in Spain. In Tunisia, the fight against desertification has led to reforestation with <em>Eucalyptus </em>spp. and <em>Optunia </em>spp., which has caused a severe, rapid reduction in the halfa steppes. In Morocco, the loss of the traditional way of life for the nomadic grazers has led to increased sedentary agricultural pressures like the increase in livestock herds.&#160;<br/>The limited dispersal  capabilities of the species and its fragmented distribution reduce the exchange of individuals between  populations and increases their extinction risk (<span lang=""EN-US"">Méndez <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;&#160;<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">The shrinking of its available habitat may be leading to territory saturation, which in turn can lead to agonistic behaviour and nest failure (Vögeli&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Pérez-Granados and López-Iborra 2013, 2015). A recent Spanish study has shown that the species's occurrence is principally determined by geographic isolation (extinction events were exclusively related to isolation), landscape matrix and patch size, rather than habitat quality (Vögeli <em>et al</em>. 2010). Isolation of local populations and reduced patch size has a compounding effect on population density since smaller populations suffer reduced singing repertoires which in turn reduce the rescuing from others (receiving immigrants), thus  compromising population persistence (Laiolo and Tella 2008,&#160;Pérez-Granados <em>et al. </em>2016). Wildfires can lead to the local extirpation of the species (Pérez-Granados <em>et al.</em> 2013b), although they can have long term benefits (Perez-Granados <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b). Additionally, wind farms may have negative impacts on the distribution of this lark (Gomez-Catasus <em>et al. </em>2018b).

The Spanish population declined by more than 20% during 1970-1990 (<strong></strong>Tucker and Heath 1994)<strong></strong>, and this rate of decline is continuing, with a 41.4% reduction in 92 subpopulations between 2004 and 2015 (Gomez-Catasus <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a). The mean probability of extinction for the whole Spanish metapopulation in 20 years has been estimated to be 0.879 (Traba <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species has also gone extinct at multiple localities in Spain over the past two decades, with a 44% range contraction (Garcia-Anton <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This contraction is associated with higher temperatures and lower precipitation, and a decrease in human population density which renders this species vulnerable to rural abandonment (Garcia-Anton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The total Spanish population was estimated at 13,000-15,000 pairs following surveys in 1988 (Garza and Suárez 1990)<strong></strong>. However, the original survey may have dramatically overestimated the size of the Spanish population, which may have comprised as few as 1,900 pairs in 1988 (<strong></strong>Garza <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Based upon census data collected in 2004-2007, the population was assessed as c.3,500-4,450 singing males (Suárez and Garza 2007, Suárez 2010) with declines noted in most areas (Garza&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. The most recent estimate for the Spanish population suggest around 3,700-4,000 males (Traba <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>Taking into account that the sex ratio is approximately 0.61 (Suárez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et  al. </span>2009), these results would mean the existence of roughly  2,200-2,700 pairs. Some authors consider that the sex ratio is even more  biased towards males (Tella <em>et al</em>. 2004, Vögeli <em>et al</em>. 2007) which  would lead to an even smaller population estimate. The European population declined by more than 40% between 2004 - 2015 (Gomez-Catasus <em>et al</em>. 2018a). A study using autonomous sound recorders discovered several previously unnoticed populations, suggesting that the distribution range is not fully known (Perez-Granados <em>et al</em>. 2018a).<br/><br/>With the exception of Morocco and Tunisia, there is a lack of precise information on distribution and boundaries of both subspecies in North Africa. It is sparsely distributed and uncommon in most areas of its relatively small and fragmented range. In Morocco, the species has a scattered and uneven distribution, and is not recorded in large areas of apparently suitable habitat. Work in Morocco calculated an effective area of suitable habitat of 1,645 km<sup>2</sup> <strong></strong>(García <em>et al</em>. 2008). This area was estimated to support a population of 15,400 singing males (García <em>et al</em>. 2008), although recent studies highlight a large variation in numbers at a local scale between 2008-2020. In Tunisia, fewer than 600 singing males were estimated in 2007, and the extent of suitable habitat was drastically reduced to &lt;100km<sup>2</sup> (Suarez, Garcia and Vinuela&#160;<em>in litt.</em> 2020), compared to previous data in Isenmann <em>et al.</em> 2005). As well as declines noted in Spain, habitat loss has been recorded within the Moroccan breeding range, but its impact and overall trends are not well understood.<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>EU Birds Directive Annex I.

In addition, chytrid infection has been reported for a lowland subpopulation (Puschendorf<em> et al</em>. 2006), but the direct effects of the infection in this species are as yet unknown (Townsend and Wilson 2016). In Texiguat, the major threats to this species include high rates of deforestation and encroachment in the wildlife refuge&#160; for extensive cattle ranching and coffee plantations, agricultural crops (e.g., beans, avocado), including in the core area, illegal selective logging for hardwoods, followed by clear-cutting along the same access routes (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).

Additional major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). There is a proposal to shift the core parts both the Parque Nacional Pico Bonito and Texiguat, which may create a much larger buffer zone where habitat conversion can progress unabated (C. Antúnez, J. Ramos Galdámez and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).<strong>&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In Campiro y Calentura, deforestation is a major threat in the northern part caused by increasing urbanisation (M.

This subpopulation appears to be stable at present, however the area is currently unprotected (J.M.&#160;Solís&#160;pers. comm. March 2019). The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is also increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong>By 1996 that most, if not all, streamside&#160;<em>Craugastor&#160;</em>known to occur above 900 m asl were thought to have disappeared in Honduras (Wilson and McCranie 1998). The reasons for the disappearances of this species at higher elevations remains unproven, although infection with chytridiomycosis together with the alteration of its habitat due to extensive landslides is a strong possibility (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;Species of the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em> group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis has been confirmed in this species (Puschendorf <em>et al</em>. 2006), and is associated with their population declines.<br/><br/>Climate change is also considered to be a threat. Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabitat a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).","The lowland subpopulations appear to be common, but higher elevation subpopulations (above 900 m asl) have been noted to be severely reduced, as have all streamside <em>Craugastor</em>&#160;species above this elevation. A dying individual was observed with a high chytrid infection at 150 m asl in northern Parque Nacional Pico Bonito (Puschendorf <em>et al</em>. 2006).

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is widely distributed from east and southeast African water systems, across the Indian Ocean to mainland India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia, and is an occasional vagrant to the Arabian Peninsula. Although there is some evidence to suggest its range may have declined as a result of barriers to migration in various localities (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Attaala and Rubaia 2005, Tamatamah 2012, Mafuca and Bills 2012, Freyhof <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mzuza <em>et al</em>. 2017). For example, two large dams in the&#160;Zambezi&#160;(Kariba and Cahora Bassa) block the migration of elvers, posing a threat to future escapement and the spawning stock (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Mafuca and Bills 2012). Throughout India too, declines have been observed in the area of occupancy possibly as a result threats such as reduced habitat availability (Shrestha 2003, Islam 2015). The species is reported as almost absent from some regions, such as the Western Ghats (J. Freyhof pers. comm. 2014). <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is exploited for consumption and is being offered for sale on business-to-business (B2B) trade platforms, however, metrics of catch or effort are not available.</p><p>While there areno quantitative time-series data relating to declines in the species, there is some evidence indicating that both range and abundance of the species are shrinking. The species has been assessed as Near Threatened (NT); it is suspected that a reduction of close to 30% is likely to have occurred over the last 3 generations (36 years), based on reports of declines across its range. It is strongly advised that monitoring for this species be conducted to better determine population status. As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal for conservation.</p><p>      </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> of November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em>&#160;juveniles feed on insects and other aquatic invertebrates while adults feed on fishes&#160;(including trout in the streams of the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe)&#160;and crabs (Okeyo 1998).&#160;This species inhabits various niches in river systems from quiet undisturbed areas containing mud substrate to deep water, fast-flowing rock pools of rivers (Bell-Cross and Minshull 1988).&#160;In Malaysia <em>A. bengalensis</em> has been found to reside in upper/mid-stream areas at higher elevation with cooler water temperatures (Arai and Kadir 2017<em>a</em>). Length estimates for this species range between 80–200 cm (Shrestha 2003) and Pantulu (1957) found there to be strong positive length/weight relationships. Further, a close linear relationship between fecundity and total length has been observed (Kadir <em>et al</em>. 2017). Total length and body weight at silvering has been found to range from 487 to 1295 mm, and 257 to 5100 g, and age at silvering has been found to range from 5.5 to 10.5 years (Chai and Arai 2018). In a study of 47 specimens from Malaysia, seaward spawning migration occurred in individuals displaying high gonadosomatic indices between April and September (Arai and Kadir 2017<em>b</em>). This suggests their spawning season may extend for at least six months of the year (Arai and Kadir 2017<em>b</em>). </p><p>    </p><p>Note: <span class=""Accentuation"">Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are potentially less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>In India and Bangladesh in particular, harvesting of this species occurs, but it is not known what impact fishing is having on the overall population. As a mottled species, <em>A. bengalensis</em> is perhaps less desirable to the East Asian market, where plain coloured eels are generally preferred. There is, however, a growing market for mottled eels, although to date this is mainly for <em>A. marmorata</em> (Shiraishi and Crook 2015).&#160;</p><p>The Conservation Assessment and Management Plan (CAMP) report on the freshwater fishes of India (Molur and Walker 1998) declared <em>A. bengalensis</em> as ‘Endangered’ according to IUCN criteria. In Bangladesh, <em>A. bengalensis</em> was assessed as ‘Vulnerable’ resulting from population decline attributable to “habitat loss and perceived over-exploitation for export” (Islam 2015). Threats reported to be affecting this species in both localities, were damming, fishing, loss of habitat, invasive species, disease, pollution, climate change, overexploitation and domestic trade (Molur and Walker 1998, Shrestha 2003, IUCN Bangladesh 2015). In Nepal specifically, most dams do not have fish and/or eel ladders, and loss of freshwater habitat is a significant problem (Shrestha 2003). </p><p><a name=""_Hlk17376556"">Barriers to migration appear to be problematic in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with dams such as the Cabora Bassa and Kariba dams&#160;preventing migration (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Mafuca and Bills 2012). A study investigating fish diversity in the Cahora Bassa Lake, found eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) to be absent (Mafuca and Bills 2012). Historic studies had previously reported these species in this area prior to the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam (Mafuca and Bills 2012). </a>In Malawi, Nkula Dam is located on the Shire River (Mzuza <em>et al</em>. 2017), which may limit available habitat and movement. In Tanzania, the construction of large dams is also thought to have contributed to eel declines (Tamatamah 2012) Within the Arabian region, vagrant individuals of this species are known from a single location in the Wadi Hajr river, which is dammed 3–4 km from the mouth, possibly blocking upstream access for eels (Attaala and Rubaia 2005, Freyhof <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p><p>In South Africa, poor water quality is anecdotally suggested to have caused eel species to become rare in some localities, such as the False Bay catchments, and few specimens remaining in this area have been observed to have severe skin lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Non-native species now found in many systems in South Africa, such as the predatory bass (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) and catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), may also have contributed to the decline (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</p><p>In 2012 a new species of parasitic nematode was discovered in the intestines of&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> collected from the freshwater bodies of Kerala State in southern Indian (Moravec <em>et al</em>. 2012). In some parts of India, this species has also been found to contain levels of pollutants that could be toxic to humans. In the Ganges River, West Bengal for example,&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> specimens that were caught contained methyl mercury concentrations that were higher than the limits set by the PFA (Provention of Food Adulteration Act) for human consumption (Pal <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;</p><p>            </p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, our understanding of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited <a name=""_Hlk17376667"">(Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015)</a>.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk6388497"">There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects as a result of the identified threats, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</a></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is the most common eel in Indian freshwater systems, and in particular in Nagaland and Assam. In 1998, this species was classified as ‘Endangered’ in India in accordance with a decline in AOO (area of occupancy) and a decline in the extent and/or quality of habitat (Molur and Walker 1998). During a systematic sampling survey carried out between 2004 and 2006 in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (a large river system in Kerala), its relative abundance was deemed 'rare' across the ten sampling locations (Radhakrishnan and Kurup 2010). The IUCN Red List of Bangladesh assessed <em>A. bengalensis</em> as ‘Vulnerable’ within its regional assessment (Islam 2015). This is due to a suspected population decline of 30% over the last ten years, resulting from habitat-loss and unsustainable exploitation (Islam 2015).</p><p>For other localities, there is limited information.&#160;There is some anecdotal evidence for localised extirpation in Africa, for example in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe where fisherman, in 1998, reported no freshwater eel had been found since the construction of a large hydroelectric dam in 1959 (S. Watanabe pers. comm. 2014). In Manyame River, Zimbabwe, <em>A. bengalensis</em> was described as “formerly more numerous”, with individuals having not been collected or caught more recently, possibly indicating decline as a result of dams (Gratwicke <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Tanzania, the decline in native eels (<em>A. bengalensis</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>) is thought to have begun in the 1980s, also as a result of dam construction (Tamatamah 2012). Fishing trials carried out over the past decade have only found a few individual eels in comparison to pre-impoundment fish studies (Tamatamah 2012).</p><p>In some areas in South Africa, such as the Eerste River catchment in False Bay, eels were historically considered a problem species, and recruiting elvers caused blockages in irrigation pumps (<a name=""_Hlk17375676"">S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019</a>). Since the 1970s, eels are no longer common in False Bay catchments; this has been suggested to be due to poor water quality (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). <a name=""_Hlk10104968"">In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, river surveys for anguillid eels combined with historical distribution data found <em>A. bengalensis</em> not to be present in areas where they were previously extant (C. Hanzen unpub. data).</a> Since 2000, <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. bengalensis</em> have disappeared from longline sample catches in some catchments in Western Cape. One example is the Breede River, home to the invasive catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), and so this may be a result of predation (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Similar to <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica, A. bengalensis </em>may have once occurred in the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay, although recent records have been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</p><p>        </p><p>In Réunion, <em>A. bengalensis </em>(listed under the redundant synonym <em>A. labiata</em>), as well as other recruiting anguillid eels (<em>A. bicolor</em>, <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>), are classified as ‘Critically Endangered’ under the regional Red List (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009). Listed threats include fisheries (target species and bycatch), habitat loss, construction of barriers to migration, and parasites (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is found in Pakistan, India (Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Arunanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Assam, and Nagaland (Tsurang River)), Bangladesh, Nepal (Gandaki, Koshi, Karnali, Mahakali), Sri Lanka, Myanmar, South Africa (Sympatric with <em>A. marmorata</em> in the Western Cape), Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Eswatini (Komati river system), Lake Kariba, Middle Zambezi and its larger tributaries on the plateau, Limpopo (Umzingwane River and Inyankuni Dam), Pungwe, Buzi, Upper and Lower Save/Runde systems in Zimbabwe. It is also found in Lake Malawi and its catchment area as well as the Shire River and its tributaries and the eastward flowing Athi and Tana drainages (Seegers&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). In Ethiopia <em>A. bengalensis</em> has been reported from the middle reaches of the Genale River catchment in the southwest of the country and is currently the only anguillid species found in the country (Golubtsov <em>et al</em>. 2012). An electrofishing study conducted in upper estuaries of the Seychelles, Mayotte, Mauritius, Reunion and the east coast of Madagascar recorded no <em>A. bengalensis</em> out of 4,172 collected eels (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 2008). Most recently, this species’ range has been extended to Aceh in Indonesia (Muchlisin <em>et al.</em> 2017), and north-western Peninsular Malaysia (Arai 2014, Arai <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arai and Wong 2016, Arai and Kadir 2017<em>a,b</em>). There are also occasional records of vagrant individuals in the Arabian Peninsula (Wadi Haj in Yemen; Ataala and Rubaia 2005). </p><p>  </p><p>There remains some uncertainty surrounding where freshwater eels including&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> spawn in the Indian Ocean. Indeed, compared to other species, very few leptocephali have been gathered for&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em>&#160;and it is still not known whether this species has a single, or multiple spawning locations, or whether spawning location overlaps with other anguillids (see Robinet <em>et al.</em> 2008, Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2014 for discussion).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, the Republic of Korea (also known as South Korea) and mainland China (hereafter China). A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). According to East Asian Customs data, between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~14 t of live eel fry for farming (glass eels and larger juveniles) from Africa (99% from Madagascar) and 7.6 t from Bangladesh (all in 2014). There is, however, no information suggesting that <em>A. bengalensis </em>is currently used (or there are plans to use it) in eel farms in East Asia.</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160;</p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis </em>is found in subsistence and commercial fisheries and in international trade, however as its range overlaps with many other anguillids, species specific data is very limited and no catch data has been reported to FAO by any of its main African or Asian range States. <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is the most common eel in Indian inland waters and is of considerable commercial value in India and the Andaman Islands. On local markets in both India and Bangladesh <em>A. bengalensis</em> is only sold during the yellow or silver eel stage; live eels (greater than 100 g) of this species, originating in Bangladesh, are being offered for sale on B2B marketplaces/trade platforms. <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em><span class=""a0""> is harvested in small quantities (on average between one and six specimens a day per fisherman) in the Ganale Dawa river basin in Ethiopia (Abelti <em>et al. </em><span class=""a0"">2014). Yellow eel bycatch in Myanmar was reported as 12 t in 2017 with 10% of this believed to be <em>A. marmorata </em><span class=""a0"">or <em>A. bengalensis </em><span class=""a0"">(SEAFDEC 2018). Other uses of the species include treatment of arthritis, piles and meningitis in India (Talwar and Jhingran 1991, Chanu <em>et al.</em><span class=""a0""> 2014). In addition, <em>A. bengalensis</em><span class=""a0""> is considered a 'pristine rare ornamental species of the Himalayan drainage' often being preserved in temple ponds for religious purposes (Shrestha 2003).<span class=""a0""></span></span></span></p><p>        </p><p>International trade in <em>Anguilla</em> commodities is reported from much of <em>A. bengalensis’s </em>range, however, the species composition of shipments is unknown and could contain many different <em>Anguilla </em>species including <em>A. bicolor, A. marmorata and A. mossambica. </em>According to UN Comtrade, exports of eel commodities (live, fresh, frozen and prepared eel) from south Asian countries increased from ~1,330 t in 2008 to ~5,170 t in 2015 (however, data is incomplete and this may be an underestimate), with live (from Bangladesh) and frozen eels (from India) being the main commodities for export. Myanmar reported exports live eels in 2010, 2014 and 2016, totalling ~10,900 t, however, live eel exports in the region are known to include other non-<em>Anguilla</em> eel species such as <em>Monopterus albus </em>(Swamp Eels). Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius also exported <em>Anguilla </em>commodities between 2008 and 2017, with most exports being live and frozen eels from Madagascar (273 t) and South Africa (129 t). Exports of live eels (all life stages) from Madagascar increased gradually from 4.6 t in 2004 to 8.8 t in 2009 and then in 2010 there was a dramatic increase in exports to over 45 t. From 2011 to 2015 annual exports fluctuated between 16t and 26 t, and in 2016 and 2017 they declined again to ~11 t. Companies trading in the southern and east Africa region declare that their glass and adult live eels are <em>A. mossambica</em> and that they are able to differentiate between species and control harvesting as glass eel recruitment is asynchronous, however exports to East Asia of live eels caught in Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa have been reported to include other species (S.

The fires are normally in the surrounding cloud forest, but still represent a threat to the species. The elfin forest is still intact, however the surrounding cloud forest is being destroyed and fragmented by subsistence agricultural use and coffee plantations. The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Hydroelectric dam development is also a problem in this area (J. Townsend and L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019).<span><br/><span><br/>Climate change is also considered to be a threat. Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Honduras (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).</span>","It is only known from three specimens (J.

Some past analyses have indicated a rapid decline, but a more recent analysis concluded that it is unlikely to have undergone a severe decline over recent decades, and is probably slightly declining or stable. Therefore, although the species is unlikely to have undergone a large population reduction over the past three generations, there is a large amount of uncertainty. For this reason, the species is listed as Near Threatened.<p></p>","It breeds in colonies, mainly on sparsely-vegetated gravels on riverbeds, often in braided river systems (Higgins and Davies 1996, Taylor 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It appears to favour rivers adjacent to high-producing pasture (McClellan and Smith 2015).&#160;It will also nest on sand-spits, shellbanks, lake margins, swamps, harbours and sandy coasts (Higgins&#160; and&#160; Davies 1996, Taylor 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It often roosts and feeds on farmland, and scavenges in urban areas where refuse is available (Higgins and Davies 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Some birds remain at colonies throughout the year, but most move from inland breeding sites to the coasts (Higgins and Davies 1996)<strong></strong>. It has a varied diet of terrestrial, freshwater and marine invertebrates, fish and shellfish (Higgins and Davies 1996, Heather and Robertson 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Breeding can begin after two years (Heather and Robertson 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, but many individuals do not start until six years old, and adults may live over 30 years (R. Hitchmough <em>in litt</em>. 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.","The main threat is predation by introduced mammals. Brown Rats <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> take eggs and chicks in the North Island. Remote video cameras have shown that Stoats (<em>Mustela erminea</em>), Ferrets (<em>Mustela furo</em>) and feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>)&#160;are major predators on South Island colonies, often taking hundreds of chicks in a season (Biswell 2006)<strong></strong>. Hedgehogs (<em>Erinaceus europaeus</em>) may also take eggs. Increased populations of the native Swamp Harrier (<em>Circus approximans</em>) and Kelp Gull (<em>Larus dominicanus</em>) also exert significant predation (Mischler 2018a). The recreational use of riverbeds and coastal areas is increasing, causing greater disturbance of nesting colonies (Taylor 2000)<strong></strong>. There have been incidents of vehicles being driven through colonies and large numbers of birds being shot&#160;(McClellanan and Habraken 2019). River modification, including hydroelectric development, channelisation and water and gravel extraction, also has a significant impact. The spread of invasive alien plant species such as Russell Lupin (<em>Lupinus polyphyllus</em>) and Broom (<em>Cytisus scoparius</em>) is a major threat, reducing suitable nesting habitat on riverbeds, providing cover for predators and forcing birds to nest closer to the water where they are more vulnerable to flooding (Maloney 1999, Taylor 2000)<strong></strong>. Intensification of agricultural practices, such as the increased use of pesticides, may reduce the availability of invertebrates. Extreme weather events such as droughts and heavy snowfall can kill thousands of individuals (McClellanan and Habraken 2019). Although the species is adapted to flooding at nesting colonies, an increased frequency of flooding may impact on productivity (McClellan 2009).","A nationwide census was carried out by the Ornithological Society of New Zealand in 1995-1998 (G. A. Taylor <em>per </em>R. Coumbe <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, and counted 48,000 nests (Powlesland 1998)<strong></strong>, thus the number of mature individuals was estimated to be 96,000. The methods used for these surveys are poorly-documented, but appear to have involved ground counts on the North Island, and a combination of ground and aerial surveys on the South Island (Hawkins and Powlesland 1995, in Mischler 2018b). The omission of some known current breeding colonies and sites from this census indicates that the population size may have been underestimated (Mischler 2018a).<br/><br/>Following a series of ground counts made across four river systems in Southland from 2004 to 2006, calibrated with aerial photography, the total population size in New Zealand was estimated at approximately 90,000 mature individuals (McClellan 2009). However, it has been suggested that gaps between the timing of some of the ground counts and aerial photographs, together with the application of inaccurate conversion factors for nests and individuals, could have led to inaccuracies in the population estimate, resulting in an overestimate (Mischler 2018a,b).<br/><br/>A further nationwide census took place from 2014-2017. Aerial surveys were used to locate, photograph and count nests, and ground surveys were used to determine a correction factor to apply to the nest counts. A total of 60,256 nests were recorded (Mischler 2018a,b), which is here assumed to equate to 120,512 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The population size is here placed in the band 90,000 - 121,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>A genetic analysis showed that the species has two distinct genetic groups, with individuals in the Rotorua region on the North Island being distinct from those in the rest of New Zealand (Mischler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The species is therefore likely to have at least two subpopulations.",Unknown,"<em>Larus bulleri</em> is endemic to <strong>New Zealand</strong>.

However recent data indicates that this population, which comprises the bulk of the global population, commenced a decline in 2010 that has since proceeded at an annual rate of 2-3%: a rate suspected to lead to an overall population reduction of between 25-38% over the three generations from 2010 and into the future. Causes of the recent decline are unknown, although population modelling indicates that only a small decline in estimated recruitment at current low levels of adult survival would lead to rapid declines in the Western Cape population. Previous declines were attributed to direct poisoning, power-line collisions and loss of its grassland breeding habitat owing to afforestation, mining, agriculture and development, any or all of which may once again be impacting the species along with potential capture for trade.

Farmers report high levels of crop damage from rodents and geese in the Overberg and Swartland (Mangnall &amp; Crowe, 2001; van Velden, 2016). Poisoned baits are commonly used for controlling rodents, which can result in accidental crane poisoning. Cranes are social birds and poisoning often involves a number of individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007). Afforestation is ongoing and large tracts of suitable grassland habitat have been designated for afforestation over the few years following 2007 in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007). In the Western Cape, the species is threatened by a change in agricultural crops and increases in the human population in agricultural areas<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Bidwell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, K. Morrison&#160;<em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2017, Shaw&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010).

It is also uncertain how predicted hotter and drier conditions in the Western Cape will affect breeding cranes over the dry summers. Prolonged dry spells affecting habitat quality not only will directly impact the species, but can also result in competition with domestic stock for habitat at such times<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>(R.

Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, Shaw <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010, Shaw, 2013), entanglement with fences, illegal capture of fledglings (for food and a growing threat from local and international trade [K.

In the Overberg, Western Cape, which holds approximately half the global population, modelling gave a conservative estimate that c.12% (95% CI 5-23%) of the Blue Crane population in the study area is killed annually in power-line collisions (Shaw <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010), which exceeds the maximum annual adult mortality rate of 7.5% beyond which a population viability assessment predicts the Western Cape population would be unable to persist (Shaw <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). Collision rates are also high in the Karoo, but mortality there is likely to be under-reported (Shaw 2013, L. Leeunwner <em>in litt. </em>2018). Both the Overberg Western Cape and the Karoo have been earmarked by the South African government as priority areas for renewable energy development, ie, wind and solar (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2016). As of yet, wind turbines have resulted in only a small number of casualties of this species, but with predicted increases in the number of wind farms this could become a greater threat to the species (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2017). The expansion of powerline networks to connect these facilities to the national grid is another threat from renewable energy development.&#160;<p></p>Specific threats to the Namibian population include the encroachment of human populations onto the grasslands, and human activities connected to agriculture destroying Blue Crane habitat. Additionally, this species is illegally hunted for use in traditional medicine, and for consumption (Simmons, 2015).","The most recent published Blue Crane population estimates for South Africa are those of McCann <em>et al. </em>(2007), with a minimum of 25,520 individuals. Of these, the Western Cape held the largest numbers, 12,095 individuals, with 10,822 in the central Karoo and 2,616 in the eastern grasslands, the traditional stronghold (McCann <em>et al. </em>2007). The disconnected population in northern Namibia is very small, with annual maxima not exceeding 35 in recent years: 32 individuals was the high in 2018, 33 in 2019 (Namibia Crane Working Group 2018, 2019, Scott <em>et al. </em>2019). The minimum estimate for the global population size is therefore <em>c.&#160;</em>25,550 individuals.<br/><br/>A recent, unpublished, Distance-based survey in the Western Cape suggests that numbers here may be higher than those estimated by McCann <em>et al. </em>(2007), with possibly up to 25,000 birds in the Western Cape alone (C. Craig <em>in litt. </em>via IUCN SSC Crane Specialist Group 2020). This is a very preliminary estimate, assuming presence at equivalent density across all pasture/fallow land in the Western Cape, and would represent a rapid increase in this population up to the recent past. Assuming stability in the other regions, the maximum population size could be <em>c.&#160;</em>38,500 individuals, while if a further assumption is made that the proportions between the three areas have remained the same (i.e. all have increased) then the potential maximum is 45,132 individuals (C. Craig <em>in litt. </em>via IUCN SSC Crane Specialist Group 2020).<br/><br/>The total population size is therefore estimated at 25,550 - 45,132 individuals (here rounded to 25,000 - 46,000 individuals), which is assumed to equate to roughly 17,033 - 30,088 mature individuals, here rounded to 17,000 - 30,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>While numbers were previously increasing in the Western Cape, recent analysis of driven transect data suggests that this population is now declining by 2-3% annually (IUCN SSC Crane Specialist Group, International Crane Foundation, Endangered Wildlife Trust, K. Shaw &amp; P. Ryan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). If this rate persists, over the next three generations (37.5 years), dependent on the proportion of the whole population that this represents, the future three-generation reduction would be suspected to fall between 24.9-37.6%.",Decreasing,"<em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Anthropoides paradiseus</span></em> is near-endemic to <strong>South Africa</strong>, with a small breeding population also in northern <strong>Namibia</strong> after rapidly declining in 1980s-1990s.

Ryan&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). There has been a 5% reduction in the number of quarter degree grid squares occupied by the species between the two South African Bird Atlas projects (SABAP 1 (1987-1991) and SABAP 2 (2007-2020).&#160; Dramatic declines previously occurred in the latter part of the twentieth century, e.g. of up to 80% in Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and Eastern Cape during the 1980s<strong> </strong>(Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>The increase in the Western Cape, which holds c. 52% of the population, accompanied the conversion of fynbos and renosterveld vegetation to agricultural land (McCann<em> et al</em>. 2007), although adult survival may be relatively low there (van Velden <em>et al. </em>2017). The population in the central Karoo region, representing c. 29% of the population, is presently thought to be stable, or potentially increasing (Allan, 2005; McCann<em> et al</em>. 2007; Shaw <em>et al</em>., 2015). In the grasslands, formerly the species's stronghold, numbers now represent <em>c.</em>14% of the total population and show significant reductions in reporting rate between SABAP 1 and SABAP 2.<br/><br/>In Namibia, the species continues to persist at low numbers: maximum counts in the 1970s of 138 individuals have dwindled to regular counts of fewer than 35 birds in the past decade (Simmons, 2015; A.

CMS Appendix II. Conservation measures have expanded in scale since the mid-1980s, including efforts to mitigate power-line collisions, addressing illegal trade, the adoption of stricter legal protection, local and national surveys in South Africa, increasing research on the species's biology and ecology, habitat protection and management programmes (especially on private land, where the majority of its habitat is [Young <em>et al.</em> 2003]), establishment of local conservation organisations, and the development of educational facilities, programmes and publications (Archibald and Meine 1996,<strong></strong> Barnes 2000). The introduction of more ecologically sensitive agrochemicals and tighter controls over their use has reduced the number of poisoning events<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007).&#160;The African Crane Conservation Programme of the International Crane Foundation / Endangered Wildlife Trust Partnership (ICF/EWT) is working in a range of areas to help conserve this species (Shaw 2015). This includes increasing environmental education of stakeholders, community involvement in sustainable use of habitats, reducing conflict with farmers, population monitoring, monitoring of the trade of captive individuals, and working with the power company Eskom to reduce power line collisions (Shaw 2015). EWT/ESKOM research in the Karoo has shown that fitting devices on transmission powerlines to make them more visible to birds is very effective in reducing Blue Crane collisions (Shaw <em>et al. </em>2021). Prioritising powerline mitigation is key to reducing this threat. A PhD project between the Endangered Wildlife Trust/ International Crane Foundation and FitzPatrick Institute is currently underway, looking to understand the threats to the species in the Western Cape and Karoo, the population trends, and to predict the viability of the species in these regions (C. Craig <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). The formation of a Crane Working Group in Namibia has facilitated education, surveys, ringing and protection (R. Simmons<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007). Future studies in Namibia will assess whether its population is genetically isolated from that in South Africa, and will use transmitters to help study habitat use, their choice of breeding areas and the occurrence of inter-breeding (Simmons <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Prevent conversion of grassland habitat to other land uses and secure sites critical to cranes in the grasslands (K.

Monitor the species's population trends through regular surveys, and conduct further work to better understand the relative impact of the different threats facing the species to help plan and prioritise conservation actions (Shaw 2015). Include habitat management in future planning of afforestable regions (Barnes 2000). Encourage more responsible use of agrochemicals<strong> </strong>(Barnes 2000). Target awareness campaigns at the farming community so as to increase awareness and reduce deliberate poisoning of cranes for food<strong> </strong>(Barnes 2000,<strong> </strong>K.

Make hazardous power-lines more visible with appropriate devices (Barnes 2000, Shaw <em>et al. </em>2010, Shaw <em>et al. </em>2021). Discourage the taking of fledglings from the wild<strong> </strong>(Barnes 2000). Encourage the retention of a mosaic of pasture and cereal cultivation in the Western Cape (Bidwell <em>et al.</em> 2006). Increase conservation protection of grasslands and wetlands north of Etosha National Park (K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007) and establish captive breeding populations to support future reintroduction and supplementation efforts. A Biodiversity Management Plan for Species for cranes, as outlined in the National Biodiversity Act (2004) would encourage national support for crane conservation efforts. Actions identified for the Namibian population include researching and monitoring population size, survival and breeding success, and movement. Identify critical areas outside of Etosha National Park that are used by cranes and potentially need conservation attention.

Increases in secondary growth forest and scrub following fires also limits suitable habitat, whilst human encroachment threatens isolated patches of the species's habitat (Wang 2014). In Bhutan, high levels of grazing and slash-and-burn agriculture are also potentially significant problems. In Nagaland, the species is protected through customary conservation laws enforced by indigenous tribal groups. &#160;Despite the law, the bird is often hunted for meat during traditional festivals.

It favours stone-free areas of natural grassland on flat or gently-sloping hilltop plateaux, with short (4-9 cm) to medium (6-8 cm) grass cover, avoiding areas with tall, dense or insufficient grass cover (Maphisa 2004)<strong></strong>. Relatively high abundances are found at severely grazed sites, although few birds breed in such habitat, where breeding success is low (D. Maphisa <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. The Molteno site is never burned, and suitable habitat is maintained by stocking cattle in the winter and removing cattle after the first rains, while&#160;indigenous grazers such as Black Wildebeest and Blesbok are present at the site throughout the year but at low densities&#160;(N. Theron and R. Colyn&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). By not burning, dry grass is available at the start of the breeding season, and may allow pairs to breed earlier than at other sites within the species range (N. Theron and R. Colyn <em>in litt. </em>2016). This species also favours edges of pans and vleis. Recent research indicates that the species would best be conserved under controlled mixed stocking rates of sheep and cattle with burning carried out every second year (Maphisa 2004)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The species requires habitat heterogeneity for nest concealment and foraging during the breeding season. The most suitable breeding habitat appears to be moderately to lightly grazed unburned or burned sites. The nest is a cup covered with a dome, constructed from old grass and lined with fresh dry grass. Egg laying occurs from October to April, with peaks in January and February (Maphisa <em>et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>. The clutch size is two to four, but most commonly three, eggs (Maphisa <em>et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The incubation period is 13-14 days and the fledging period is c.13 days (Maphisa <em>et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Nestlings are fed on young locusts, other insects, worms and arachnids (Maphisa 2004)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.<p></p>","Habitat loss and fragmentation, as a result of agricultural intensification, inappropriate pasture management and afforestation, have resulted in local population reductions. Grasslands are modified into fields for cultivation and grazing or claimed for housing (Maphisa 2004), and this may have played a role in the possible extinction of the species in the Matatiele region (N. Theron and R. Colyn <em>in litt. </em>2016) which had previously held to highest density of Rudd's Lark in South Africa (Hockey <em>et al.</em>&#160;1988)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Further commercial afforestation may take place below the escarpment, and poses little threat to the species (D. Maphisa <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.  Human settlement and other developments are considered a major threat to the species's habitat (D. Maphisa <em>in litt</em>. 2007; N. Theron and R. Colyn <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Uncontrolled ploughing of pristine/near-pristine habitat as part of agricultural initiatives to alleviate food shortages has also been reported (A. Burns <em>in litt</em>. 2005), especially prevalent in the Matatiele area (N. Theron and R. Colyn <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The other primary threats are unsuitable fire regimes and grazing practices. It is also threatened by mining, although plans for the exploration of  three sites in the Wakkerstroom area for torbanite and coal by Delta  Mining Consolidated (Verdoorn 2008) have apparently since been scrapped. Late burning of grassland might shorten the potential breeding season and force a peak in breeding that coincides with high predator numbers (Maphisa <em>et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Extensive wildfires in Mpumalanga and Free State in 2007 may have caused a decline in the species's population (N. Smith<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Within South Africa as a whole, 60-80% of grassland has been irreversibly transformed. All of South Africa's maize crop and much of its wheat is produced in former grassland areas, illustrating the magnitude of threats this species faces today. The new emerging threats include construction of dams to generate electricity or wind farms (Maphisa 2015). Climate change is also predicted to have future impact on this species (Huntley and Bernard 2012).&#160;The loss of the species's habitat over the next 10 years could be moderate (&lt;50%) unless planned intervention takes place. Predation has been observed as the main cause of nest loss, with mongooses, rodents and snakes identified as the main predators (Maphisa <em>et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. <p></p>","Siegfried (1992) suggested a global population of 1,500-5,000 individuals. Estimates for the proposed Grassland Biosphere Reserve suggest that 2,500 individuals is a more realistic lower limit for this species. This range is roughly equivalent to 1,700-3,300 mature individuals; however, the total may be significantly lower (D. Maphisa <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012, 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Heteromirafra ruddi</em> is an endemic resident of east <strong>South Africa</strong>. Although records are spread over a large area, its distribution within this area is patchy. The core of its restricted range has been centred on south-east Mpumalanga, north-west KwaZulu-Natal and the north-east Free State, however, up to date information is lacking for much of this range (D. Maphisa <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Small, isolated populations are found farther north in the Dullstroom-Machadodorp district, and possibly at Ncora Dam and Molteno in the Eastern Cape; although there have been no confirmed sightings for several years around Dullstroom and it may have become locally extinct in areas of Eastern Cape (Peacock 2015; R. Colyn <em>verbally </em>2017). A population at Matatiele in west KwaZulu-Natal has possibly gone extinct (N. Theron and R. Colyn <em>in litt. </em>2016). Further surveys in 2010 between the Normandien pass and Ncandu Nature Reserve had a possible alarming individual, but no sighting was confirmed (D. Maphisa <em>in litt. </em>2016).<em>&#160;</em>The overall population was not thought to have decreased significantly since the mid-1990s (P. Ryan<em> in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, however its absence has been noted at former strongholds, suggesting it is now in decline (D. Maphisa <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>, and comparison of data in South African Bird Atlas Project 1 and 2 indicates a reduction in area of occupancy of over 50% (D. Maphisa <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Historical records from Warden in the Free State and sight records from the Memel-Vrede-Warden-Harrismith arc suggest that there may be a substantial, previously overlooked, population in the eastern Free State, and the remaining natural grassland in the area looks suitable, although agriculture is intense (D. Maphisa <em>in litt. </em>2016). The global population has been estimated at 1,500-5,000 individuals (Siegfried 1992)<strong></strong>. A lower limit of 2,500 individuals has been suggested as more realistic (Barnes and Tarboton 1998)<strong></strong>, but it has been suggested that the lack of new sites and disappearance from former strongholds mean the total population may be much lower (D.

However, the fencing of the area and removal of cattle lead to a change in habitat structure rendering the site unsuitable for Rudd’s Lark (Theron and Colyn&#160;<em>in prep</em>). The developing land stewardship programme centred around Volksrust and Wakkerstroom is estimated to hold c.85% of the global population (Barnes 1998; A.

As a result of intensive conservation action however, the species is now recovering at least in parts of its range. If conservation action was to stop, the population increase could quickly revert so that the species could qualify for a threatened status within a short time. Consequently it is listed as Near Threatened. <p></p>","Although once abundant in native prairie intermixed with oak <em>Quercus</em> spp. woodland, as prairie and woodland habitats were converted to cropland it had to adapt to agricultural habitats (Schroeder and Robb 1993; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994)<strong></strong>. Areas of native vegetation are still required for roosting and breeding, and for displaying males which will select lek sites with short grass, usually on elevated ground (Hovick <em>et al</em>. 2015). Most nest sites are in open, grassy habitats such as ungrazed meadows or hayfields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>",Loss of prairie habitat through conversion to cropland was primarily responsible for the extinction of <em>T. c. cupido</em> and declines in the other two subspecies. Grazing pressure from sheep and the increase in cropland throughout areas of native prairie is threatening the remaining population of <em>T. c. attwateri</em> in Texas. Habitat fragmentation leading to isolated populations and a loss of genetic variance and subsequent decreases in fertility will reduce fitness and reinforce negative demographic trends (Westemeier <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. In certain states hunting continues (Schroeder and Robb 1993)<strong></strong>. The species may suffer from competition with Ring-necked Pheasant <em>Phasianus colchicus </em>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994)<strong></strong>. Noise from roads and wind turbines were found to negatively affect the propagation distance of boom calls at leks (Raynor <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><p></p>,"The global population is estimated to number 360,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).",Increasing,"<em>Tympanuchus cupido</em> is restricted to prairie intermixed with cropland, primarily in the mid-western states of the <strong>USA</strong>. The three recognised subspecies vary in status: the Heath Hen <em>T. c. cupido</em> is extinct, and the Attwater's Prairie Hen <em>T. c. attwateri</em> is restricted to small portions of south-east Texas (numbering under 1,000 in the mid-1990s [del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994]<strong></strong>) (Schroeder and Robb 1993) and under 70 individuals in the 2010's [M. Morrow <em>per</em> Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2020). The Greater Prairie-chicken (<em>T. c. pinnatus</em>) is extinct or in danger of extinction in 15 states, but numerous enough to be legally hunted in four states (Schroeder and Robb 1993)<strong></strong>, with the largest remaining populations in Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).

Effective strategies have included manipulation of grazing pressure, control of burning and establishment of reserves. Removal of encroaching eastern red-cedar (<em>Juniperus virginiana</em>) trees has been identified as an essential activity for population survival (McNew <em>et al</em>. 2012; Raynor <em>et al</em>. 2019). Population reintroduction may be necessary to expand its distribution, particularly where there are no dispersal corridors between occupied and unoccupied habitats (Roy and Gregory 2019), but so far it has had mixed success (Schroeder and Robb 1993; Roy and Gregory 2019)<strong></strong>. Hunting legislation has frequently been used to protect populations, with mixed success - both <em>T. c. cupido </em>and <em>attwateri</em> were protected. Legislation has been more effective with <em>T. c. pinnatus</em>, perhaps because of its large and diverse distribution (<strong></strong>Schroeder and Robb 1993)<strong></strong>. Lek density was found to be substantially higher in grasslands and wetlands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program scheme (Adkins <em>et al</em>. 2019). Translocations led to a significant increase in mtDNA diversity (Bateson <em>et al</em>. 2014), while population reinforcement lowered the site-specific extinction probabilities (Hardy <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends. Monitor rates of habitat loss and degradation within the species's range. In remaining tallgrass prairie, infrequent burning and grazing (i.e., patch-burn grazing) shows promise for enhancing survival by providing habitat at nesting, brooding and wintering life stages (Winder <em>et al</em>. 2017; Londe<em> et al</em>. 2019). Strictly control hunting, and if survival is confirmed to be higher in unhunted populations, consider banning hunting of the species. Retain/restore corridors of suitable habitat between populations to facilitate dispersal and reduce the stresses associated with a loss of genetic variation.

Poisoning from anticoagulant rodenticides is now suspected to be the most significant threat, with the number of birds potentially poisoned in this way dramatically increasing since 2014 (Coeurdassier <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Increasing urbanisation and road construction bring disturbance further into the breeding habitat. Below 1,300 m, cultivation and urbanisation have eliminated native forest from all but the steepest of slopes.

It no longer qualifies as Vulnerable as there is no continuing decline. Recent increases in the population have been driven by a reduction in adult mortality through a combination of winter habitat protection and creation, and potentially also a temporary increase in the extent of suitable breeding habitat due to glacial melting. <br/><br/>The species remains Near Threatened as it is plausible that further changes in breeding habitat driven by climate change will reverse the positive recent impact and result in loss of wetlands. In addition there is concern that the impact of existing threats will grow, specifically from feral dogs and human disturbance at breeding sites, and power line collisions and accidental poisoning events during migration and the non-breeding season.<p></p> <p></p>","It breeds in alpine bog meadows and riverine marshes, favouring lacustrine marshes from 2,600-4,900 m. It prefers to nest at large water bodies, at a water depth of around 30 cm: this probably minimises exposure to nest predators. It winters in river valleys and along reservoir shorelines in the vicinity of barley and spring wheat fields. Whilst it prefers breeding in lakes, shallow marshes and meadows are the most important habitat for feeding; its diet consists of roots, tubers, insects, snails, shrimps, fish, frogs, small birds and rodents (Wu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009; Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010a, 2014).<br/><p></p>","Threats to the species are primarily connected with the availability of sufficient undisturbed habitat with suitable water levels. There is evidence that Black-necked Cranes are becoming concentrated at fewer sites in wintering locations, with some previously used areas being converted to greenhouse agriculture or for industrial development (Jia <em>et al. </em>2019). The general increase in the human population in the vicinity of the wetlands the species uses results in higher water demands that can reduce the suitability of key sites, while some have been directly drained for development (Lhendup and Webb 2009). Consequently, development projects that affect the control of water levels must account for the potential impact on the species, which is highly sensitive to water levels due to the threat from mammalian predators. At Dashanbao National Nature Reserve, China, plans to designate the area as a National Park include the relocation of people away from the core zone, however the increasing population of Black-necked Crane demonstrate a clear affinity for human sites due to the provision of waste grain from farming activities (Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The relocation plan would lead to the abandonment of&#160;farmland, upon which the cranes depend (Kong&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011. Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Wu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This represents a potential significant reduction in the number of cranes that this key site can support over winter in the future, which may drive increased adult mortality in this section of the population. Currently, a payment for ecosystem services pilot appears to be contributing towards a steady increase in crane numbers here (Peng <em>et al. </em>2020). A switch to planting a greater proportion of winter wheat reduces the availability of grain on cultivated land, and Peng <em>et al. </em>(2020) also demonstrate that the species generally avoids ploughed fields.&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change appears to be having a positive effect on the species's habitat over recent years (Li 2019), but there is concern that future change will reverse any positive impacts due to drying of breeding sites within the high altitude breeding range of the species (J. Harris&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007, M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In some areas water levels may be rising as a result of glacial melt and increased rainfall, but a lot of shallow wetlands used by the cranes are thought to be disappearing due to permafrost degradation (Farrington 2009). For example, in Ladakh, India, Lake Tsomoriri showed a rise in water between 2000-2006 and then the water level started decreasing, whereas Tsokar Basin is shrinking (P. Chandan&#160;<em>pers comm. per&#160;</em>M. A. Bishop and F. Li.&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). These peripheral areas of the population may be the first to demontrate negative impacts and these populations should be carefully monitored.<br/><br/>A small number of birds have been killed after striking power-lines (Li 2002; Li&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012), and wind turbines could prove an additional threat (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;The threat from power-lines is suspected to be growing following the rapid expansion of local power grids in China: 9 out of 15 juvenile Black-necked Crane fitted with satellite tags were killed in Linzhou, Tibet between 2018-2020 (Y. Guo&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). The use of poisoned bait to control rodent pests in breeding areas poses the risk of unintentional posioning (Li 2019). Intensive grazing has caused degradation of grasslands in breeding grounds, with an increase in grazing in wetlands of particular concern (Li 2019). In Bhutan and India, feral dogs have been increasingly observed to take eggs and chicks, and even adults (I. Acharja <em>in litt. </em>2020, S. Dhumal <em>in litt. </em>2020, J. Eaton <em>in litt. </em>2020,&#160;&#160;L. Visuddha <em>in litt. </em>2020)<br/>There are additional threats from poorly-regulated tourism to wintering areas, which could cause significant disturbance to large numbers of birds and reduce habitat area and quality through the creation of additional infrastructure such as roads (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Fish-farming, peat and firewood collection, river channelisation, industrial pollution and sedimentation, and the construction of roads and fences have resulted in increased disturbance and habitat degradation in Qinghai, Sichuan, Ruoergai and Yunnan, China (Wu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, Qiang Liu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). Further disturbance at the species's stopover sites arises from the use of the areas as camping grounds by local herders (Qian&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).&#160;The collection of eggs and poaching have been problems in parts of China and India, although the extent of this is currently not thought to be significant.","The global population is estimated at c.10,000-10,200 individuals in total (Li <em>et al </em>2014), roughly equivalent to&#160;c.6,600-6,800 mature individuals.

Based on counts of breeding birds at rivers in the South Island of New Zealand, the population may have undergone a reduction of over 30% over the past three generations, but winter counts from New Zealand indicate a slower decline, and winter counts from Australia do not indicate a reduction over the past three generations. For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.","It usually breeds inland on sand or gravel banks alongside braided rivers, or in dry montane habitats with short vegetation at high altitudes, although it also breeds in a range of other habitats including coasts, pasture, ploughed arable land, quarries and moors (Heather and Robertson 1996, Wiersma <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;Outside the breeding season, it occurs in a range of coastal and freshwater habitats, usually near the coast, including estuaries, swamps, lagoons, beaches, salt-lakes, saltmarshes, grassland and pasture (Heather and Robertson 1996, Wiersma <em>et al. </em>2019). During winter, it roosts in flocks at traditional and often at inaccessible sites (Wiersma <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). It feeds on molluscs, insects, crustaceans, marine worms, spiders, seeds and berries (Wiersma <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). It breeds in July- January (Heather and Robertson 1996).","Introduced mammalian predators are likely to be a major threat. Video camera studies in the Upper Waitaki Basin have detected predation by cats, ferrets and hedgehogs (Sanders and Maloney 2002). Of 114 nests monitored, around half suffered predation events (Sanders and Maloney 2002). A study of 161 nests in the Tasman River found that 89% were successful, with losses attributed to predation and flooding (Cruz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;In the Auckland Islands, the species may have disappeared from the main island as a result of predation by cats and pigs (Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991).<br/>Other threats include hydroelectricity developments and irrigation schemes, which lead to degradation of their riverbank nesting habitat (Heather and Robertson 1996). Encroachment of invasive plant species leads to a loss of breeding habitat on river beds. Extreme tides and flooding events may impact the species, and human disturbance may cause breeding attempts to fail. A study of 33 nesting attempts on beaches on an oceanic spit in North Canterbury found that 40% of eggs were lost to tidal or river floods, and 29% were lost due to human disturbance (Kearvell 2011). Low minimum river flow was also associated with lower breeding success, probably necause it allowed for easier access by predators (Cruz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).<br/>In Australia, the species is thought to be threatened by a cessation of grazing, which leads to habitat becoming unsuitable (Department of the Environment 2020). Habitat has also been lost through flood mitigation and river management, and through the planting of willows (Department of the Environment 2020). Agricultural and industrial pollution and invasive plants such as <em>Spartina anglica&#160;</em>may also lead to habitat degradation (Department of the Environment 2020).","Lane (1987) estimated the minimum number of individuals to be 12,450, based on the maximum observed simultaneous counts in New Zealand and Australia in the mid-1980s. The population of<em> C. b. exilis&#160;</em>in the Auckland Islands&#160;was estimated to number 730 birds in 1989 (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991). There is no more recent population data on this subspecies.<br/>Heather and Roberton (1996) estimated the population size to be c.50,000 individuals, based on banding studies, with c.30,000 (60%) wintering in Australia.&#160;Pierce (1999) considered that the population probably exceeded 50,000 individuals, based on estimates of the wintering population in Tasmania, data from breeding grounds and proportions of colour-banded individuals seen at non-breeding sites (Dowding and Moore 2006).<br/>During extensive surveys of estuaries around the New Zealand coast between 1983 and 1994, Sagar <em>et al.</em>&#160;(1999) counted a maximum of 9,242 birds during winter (with similar numbers reported in the North and South Islands), leading to a New Zealand winter population estimate of 10,843 individuals. The low counts were attributed to the lack of surveys inland, where large numbers overwinter. During similar winter coastal surveys in New Zealand from 1994 to 2003, total counts ranged from 2,759 to 6,296, with an average of 4,546 (Southey 2009). Winter population estimates of 5,083 - 7,335 between 1995 and 2004 were derived, with an estimate of 5,406 individuals for 2003 (Southey 2009). These figures were thought to represent underestimates of the true New Zealand wintering population, since some moderately important overwintering sites were not included in the surveys, but the total winter population in New Zealand was thought unlikely to be as high as 20,000 individuals (Southey 2009).<br/>The population in the Chatham Islands has been estimated to be around 200-300 individuals (Aikman and Miskelly 2004). <br/>Based on count data from&#160;2005/2006 to 2014/2015, the global population was estimated to be 13,057 individuals based on counts alone, 18,786 based on spatial extrapolations, and 19,559 based on range area and density estimates, with a final rounded population estimate of 19,000 (Hansen <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/>Counts of breeding individuals on braided rivers in the South Island New Zealand from&#160;1962–2017 recorded a total of&#160;12,730 birds (O'Donnell and Monks in press).<br/>The population size is here placed in the band 13,057 - 19,559 individuals, here rounded to 13,000 - 20,000 individuals.

However, the population in the wild remains dependent on intensive conservation management efforts. The population currently numbers 93 mature individuals, with 62 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation and as a result, it currently meets the threshold for listing as Endangered. However, the population only increased sufficiently above the threshold for listing as Critically Endangered in 2019, hence the species continues to be listed as Critically Endangered under the five-year rule. Should such population increases continue, it will warrant downlisting in 2024.<p></p> <p></p>","Its range includes rocky, open-country scrubland, coniferous forest and oak savanna<strong></strong>. Cavities in ledges on cliffs, rocky outcrops or in large trees are used as nest sites (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong>.  It scavenges on the carcasses of large mammals and also feeds on the carcasses of small mammals. California ground squirrels are a documented small mammal food source in California and a source of lead poisoning as they are routinely shot as nuisance animals on private ranges. Investigations into the amount of small mammal use as a food source in the Arizona/Utah population is ongoing (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Relative to foraging, released birds reach independence soon after release, and may range more than 400 km from release sites (Anon. 1998), though the distance an individual ranges can vary depending on season and individuals released at different sites have shown significantly different home range sizes (Rivers <em>et al. </em>2014), suggesting local ecological factors may play a role.<p></p>","The drastic population decline during the 20th century is principally attributed to persecution and accidental ingestion of fragments and residues from lead bullets and lead shot from carcasses (C. N. Parish <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), resulting in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning remains a key threat and the leading cause of death for released birds (Rideout <em>et al</em>. 2012, Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has caused many fatalities and resulted in the treatment of many more birds (Anon. 2001, Parish <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, Walters <em style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2010).&#160;As a result of their life history strategy, characterised by&#160;high adult survival, long life expectancy, and low reproductive rates, condor populations are particularly sensitive to lead poisoning, which severely impacts adult survival; lead can build up initially in the blood, but then in the bone and tissues to dangerous levels over longer periods having been ingested over a broad area (Hunt&#160;<em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.&#160;</span>2007, S. Kirkland&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020)<strong></strong>. Lead poisoning therefore continues to be the principal threat to condors and at current levels threaten the long-term sustainability of reintroduced populations (Cade 2007, Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012, Rideout <em>et al</em>. 2012). It was reported in 2009 that over 90% of condors released in Arizona still test positive for lead (Toops 2009) whilst Rideout <em>et al</em>. (2012) determined that lead toxicosis was the leading, identifiable cause of death in juvenile (26% of deaths where the cause could be determined) and adult (67%) free-ranging California Condors since the inception of the reintroduction program in 1992. A study conducted in California, using samples collected in 2004-2009, suggests that around one third of condors have blood lead values associated with toxicological effects based on inhibition of the&#160;heme biosyntheticenzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012). Sequential feather samples have been used to reconstruct a condor’s lead exposure history over the 3-4-month time frame of feather growth and this data demonstrates that condors are exposed to lead more frequently, and at higher levels than indicated by blood monitoring data (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;2012). A study using samples collected between 1997 and 2011 showed that blood lead concentrations increased as birds became less reliant on provisioned food, as they became older and as their home range size increased (Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and Bakker <em>et al</em>. (2017) found that condor survivorship was negatively related to time spent feeding on provisioned food. In 2017, 69 of the 78 birds in the Arizona/Utah population showed high levels of lead exposure; despite a treatment, two individuals died from severe lead-poisoning (Vulture Specialist Group 2017).<br/><br/>The population along the Central Pacific Californian coast also suffers from reduced eggshell thickness, consistent with the effects of DDE exposure, a breakdown compound of the pesticide DDT, compromising reproduction in the wild (Burnett <em>et al.</em> 2013). Apparently restricted to condors feeding on the coast, DDE exposure has been linked to feeding on the carcasses of California Sea Lions that had been exposed to the pesticide during their lifetimes (Kurle <em>et al</em>. 2016). The lack of additional DDT inputs suggests that these effects will decrease over time, though at present this is an impediment to sustainable wild reproduction in the coastal population. Ingested anthropogenic material has been responsible for the deaths of nestlings and strongly implicated in a number of other nestling deaths. The dead condors were found to have swallowed significant quantities of micro-trash (e.g. glass fragments, wire, plastic cartridge cases, etc.) and Rideout <em>et al</em>. (2012) observed this to be the leading cause of death in nestlings (76% of identifiable causes); micro-trash has however, recently been observed not to be&#160;significant source of lead poisoning and that the vast majority of lead micro-trash items were related to lead-ammunition (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2015). Shooting still occurs and is often identified in live birds that have been radiographed during lead testing or in relation to other injuries. Eleven birds have been killed as a result of being shot since 1998 (USFWS 2019, <em>unpublished data</em>).<br/><br/>Puppet-reared birds were initially thought to exhibit greater problematic human-oriented behaviour, such as tameness and vandalising property, than parent-reared birds (Meretsky&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000)<strong></strong>. However, there is no apparent difference in mortality between released birds that were puppet-reared and those which were parent-reared (Woods&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007)<strong></strong>.&#160;Clark <em>et al</em>. (2007) modified puppet rearing practices to try and address concerns with initial captive reared birds. Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2007) compared the post-release results of birds reared with modified puppet rearing techniques in an isolated population in Baja, Mexico, with those released in the United States and evidenced that changes in socialisation techniques of young captive reared birds largely alleviated early problems with captive reared birds. At present, condors in the current wild subpopulations are not entirely immune to some interactions with human structures (i.e. perching on communication towers, mountain homes, South rim of the Grand Canyon) and behavioural modifications including attempts to haze them when possible are still employed. Cade <em>et al</em>. (2004) identified three types of interactions with humans and human structures where Type 1 and 2 were acceptable, while Type 3 was considered unacceptable and associated with birds showing no fear of humans, approaching them with no escape route. These categories remain the general benchmarks for the Recovery Program in determining whether or not a condor is exhibiting problematic behaviour and few condors are now removed from the wild due to behavioural problems. In the early 1990s a number of captive-reared birds were lost owing to collisions with power-lines and a conditioning programme with mock power poles was initiated to address it (L. Kiff&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;This practice has since been adopted in the field to help avoid power pole electrocutions in wild-fledged condors. However, collisions and subsequent electrocution following mid-span collisions continue to periodically occur. Seventeen total cases of electrocution have been documented since 1993, including several in 2015, 2016 and 2019, with lead poisoning being identified as a cofactor in at least one of these deaths (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The spread of west Nile virus has not been a significant problem for the species as most birds are still vaccinated (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005) however, as the wild population continues to grow, it is anticipated that it will not remain feasible to vaccinate all wild nestlings. Therefore, efforts to understand the potential significance of west Nile virus on the recovery of the species are under way.&#160;Lead poisoning however, continues to represent the most significant known cause of mortality in the wild; approximately 50% of all deaths with a determined cause are lead poisoning (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>). The&#160;effect of treating individual birds for lead poisoning is currently being studied to assess whether it has any effect on survivorship in the wild California population (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Currently, the population would not continue to grow without the continued release of captive-bred birds.","There are currently 201 adults in the wild that are old enough to breed (age 5 and older), and 93 have produced viable offspring.&#160;Twenty-three wild birds turned five years old in 2019 and 17 more will turn five years old in 2020.&#160; A total of 141 wild birds are 8 years old or older, the observed average age of productivity (i.e. producing young when greater than or equal to eight years of age). Since mature individuals (as defined by IUCN) only includes individuals in the wild that are currently capable of reproduction, and re-introduced individuals must have produced viable offspring before they are counted as mature individuals, the current global population <span style=""font-style: italic;"">sensu</span> IUCN is 93 mature individuals as of March 2020 (USFWS California Condor Recovery Program, <em>unpublished data</em>).",Increasing,"This species declined rapidly throughout its historic range from British Columbia to Baja California during the 19th century and reportedly disappeared from outside California, <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, in 1937 (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. The population had dropped to an all-time low of just 22 birds by 1981, and in 1983 eggs were first taken from wild nests for captive-rearing; in 1987 the species became extinct in the wild when the last of the six wild individuals was captured to join a captive-breeding recovery programme involving 27 birds (Wilbur and Kiff 1980,<em></em> Toops 2009)<strong></strong>. Due to intensive captive breeding and reintroduction efforts the population increased to 223 birds by August 2003, comprising 138 in captivity, and 85 reintroduced in California and northern Arizona (L. Kiff <em>in</em> <em>litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Breeding in the wild resumed in 2002 and now occurs in all wild subpopulations (California, Arizona/Utah and Baja, <strong>Mexico</strong>).<br/><br/>The sub-population in California comprises 200 wild individuals in two distinct but loosely intermixing flocks. The Southern Californian flock is managed by the USFWS Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Condor Recovery staff and the Central California flock is managed collectively by the Ventana Wildlife Society and Pinnacles National Park. Each of the&#160;California flocks includes approximately 100 free flying individuals as of December 31st 2019 (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;The Arizona sub-population includes 98 free-flying individuals and there are an additional 39 free-flying individuals in the Baja, Mexico subpopulation. The combined total wild population as of December 2019 stands at 337 with an additional 181 captive individuals, for a total world population of 518. The regular movements of the Arizona birds are mostly confined to Coconnino County (Arizona) and Kane County (Utah), although several individuals have been documented wandering in Wyoming, southwestern Colorado and New Mexico before returning to the Vermilion Cliffs release area (C. N. Parish <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The California birds occur regularly in Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterrey, San Benito, Tulare and Fresno Counties. Currently, range expansion has been documented as far north as Alameda County in the west and Madera County in the east along the foothills of the Central Sierra Nevada Mountains. The species's geographic range continues to expand as the population grows in size (Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The reintroduction programme continues and has expanded its geographic coverage, with six birds released into the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, Mexico in 2002 (USFWS 2002)<strong></strong>. A release site in Baja was established in October 2003. The first chick hatched in Mexico for over 75 years hatched in April 2007. The Baja California birds are  largely confined to the Sierra de San Pedro Martir (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>, where release efforts are ongoing to augment the wild population; these birds have continued to expand their range and have reached both the Pacific and Gulf of California coasts (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It is hoped these birds will range widely enough to be effectively connected with birds in the southern U.S.A., and a bird from the Baja population was seen in San Diego County in April 2007. Second generation birds have matured to breeding age and wild fledged pairs have now fledged their own chicks into the wild however, no population can be deemed sustainable, and without substantial reductions in the use of lead-based ammunition within the condor's range, none are likely to become so (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. The recovery programme for the species continues to address threats to the wild population, but lead contamination remains the greatest of these threats (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017); lead poisoning represents approximately 50 percent of all known causes of death in the total population (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I and II. A large-scale, integrated captive-breeding programme, managed by the Peregrine Fund (at the World Center for Birds of Prey), Los Angeles Zoo, Oregon Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park and Chapultepec Zoo, Mexico City, and reintroduction program, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,&#160;Ventana Wildlife Society, Peregrine Fund, Pinnacles National Park and Government of Mexico, is maintaining and growing the population in the wild (USFWS 2019).&#160;The success of the captive breeding program has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to approximately 30 birds produced for release to the wild annually. The genetic diversity of the population is maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004)<strong></strong>. 'Aversion training' to avoid power poles&#160;appears successful in preventing electrocution from perching on power poles and is ongoing (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Condors still periodically collide with powerlines during flight hence&#160;California power companies have buried and replaced some above ground power lines with insulated lines in areas with high levels of condor activity; insulated&#160;lines protect condors from electrocution following mid-span collision and anecdotally may be more visible to the birds since they are darker and slightly thicker (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>A total of 287 condors were released into the wild between 1992 and 2019 (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>)<strong></strong>. Clean carcasses are provided for reintroduced birds to&#160;supplement the food they would otherwise receive from their parents in the wild, and to assist in trapping to replace transmitters, test for lead, and assess general health. Education programs aim to minimise persecution&#160;and educate the public about the conservation benefits of using non-lead ammunition for hunting and land management (Hunting with non-lead 2020, North American Non-lead Partnership 2020).&#160;However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than when the population was younger and smaller, and are less likely to take the food provided for them after age two (Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017). A huge step has been taken towards trying to eliminate the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, and Assembly Bill 711 which requires the use of non-lead ammunition for the taking of all wildlife species throughout the state of California; lead-based ammunition can however, still be used for the putting down of livestock, impacting condors that frequent livestock ranch lands for foraging (A. Brickey&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The effectiveness&#160;of these regulatory bans on the survivorship and recovery of the species remains to be seen. Meanwhile, there is a growing program to promote the use of non-lead ammunition in hunting and wildlife management. The Ventana Wildlife Society, Arizona Game and Fish Department and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources are distributing non-lead&#160;bullets free of charge to hunters within the foraging range of the condors. In 2008 an agreement was struck between the Tejon Ranch and five conservation organisations in California to preserve 240,000 acres of the 270,000 acre property as an open space in return for not opposing the development of the remaining land, providing a vast amount of foraging habitat for the condor (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>.&#160;This conservation program has certainly reduced the amount of lead available to condors, as larger and larger percentage of the Southern California flock continue to forage there, however this area only represents approximately 2.5 % of the 9,600,000 acre geographic range this flock occupies.&#160;The North American Non-lead Partnership is engaging State Wildlife Management Agencies, to promote the voluntary use of non-lead ammunition as a traditional wildlife management practice that benefits non-target trust wildlife resources by eliminating secondary poisoning from the ingestion of spent lead ammunition.&#160; A willing partnership between hunting and endangered species conservation that facilitates a cultural shift away from hunting with traditional lead ammunition, may be the most practical way a significant reduction in the use of lead ammunition is likely to occur.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends.&#160;Revise the recovery plan using updated population modeling (Bakker <em>et al.</em> 2017) and management information, to determine survivorship and demographic parameters for a self sustaining population of condors.

Previously, Red Kite was listed as Near Threatened because of a suspected moderately rapid population decline, owing mostly to poisoning from pesticides and persecution, and changes in land-use amongst other threats. However, these declines have been more than compensated by increases in the majority of countries within its range, at a rate that means that declines over the past three generations have been overcome. There are still declines in southern Spain, Portugal, and locally in Germany and perhaps France, and the species has recently been lost as a breeding species in Morocco. Poisoning (both deliberate and accidental) remains the greatest threat to continued population growth and threatens the persistence of the species regionally, especially in southern Iberia. However, overall the data indicate that the global population has increased by more than 30% over the last three generations and the species is assessed as Least Concern.<p></p> <p></p>","The species breeds in broadleaf woodlands and forests, mixed with farmland, pasture and heathland, up to 1,600 m in Switzerland (A. Aebischer <em>in litt. </em>2016) and formerly possibly to 2,500 m in Morocco<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo<em> e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1994). In winter it also occupies wasteland, scrub and wetlands. Formerly an urban scavenger, it still visits the edges of towns and cities and is now frequent in suburban areas where they will visit gardens (Orros &amp; Fellowes 2014). It takes a wide range of food, but feeds mainly on carrion and small to medium-sized mammals and birds. Reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are less important prey.<br/><br/>Many birds in north-east Europe are migratory, wintering mainly in southern France and Iberia, but with some travelling as far as North Africa<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo<em> et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1994). Migrants travel south from their breeding grounds between August and November, returning between February and April (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs, but sometimes form small flocks when soaring on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) or at open waste disposal sites. The availability of high density reliable food provided by landfill managed in certain ways may influence the degree to which kites are sedentary in an area (Evans and Pienkowski 1991): high availability of roadkill may also influence movement decisions.&#160;<br/><p></p>","The most pertinent threat to this species is illegal direct poisoning  to kill predators of livestock and game animals (targetting foxes, wolves, corvids etc.) and indirect poisoning from pesticides and secondary poisoning from consumption of poisoned rodents by rodenticides spread on farmland to control vole plagues, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, where it may drive rapid population declines<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(e.g. see Villafuerte <em>et al. </em>1998, Mougeot <em>et al. </em>2011, A. Aebischer <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>. </em>2009); there has been reported a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Carter 2007). An estimate of 430-1,800 individuals killed illegally in Spain annually indicates that this remains a significant problem for birds that do migrate and for the regional population (Brochet <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(J. Vi<span lang=""ES"">ñuela <em>in lit<em>t</em></em><em>.</em> 2009). The total of recovered, confirmed poisoning cases in Spain is 1,187 individuals found dead between 1992 and 2015 (Cano&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;In north  Scotland, 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 were found to have been  killed by poisoning (Smart <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(P. Tourret <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to  chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological  impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Wind turbines are a potentially serious threat (Duchamp 2003, Mammen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Schaub<em>&#160;</em>2012, P. Tourret <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009); 18 Red Kite were located having been killed by collisions with windfarms in 2019 (F. David <em>in litt. </em>2020). Other less significant threats include electrocution and collision with powerlines<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong></strong>(Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>,&#160; hunting and trapping (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009), road-kills, deforestation, egg-collection (on a local scale) (Ferguson-Lees <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 2001, Mammen 2007, Cardiel and Viñuela 2007)<strong></strong>. Another factor implicated in the declines in France and Spain is a decrease in the number of rubbish dumps<strong></strong> (Mionnet 2007, Cardiel and Viñuela 2007)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","Recent data submitted to the European Commission for EU countries (which hold at least 90% of the global population) estimated a total of 29,746- 34,751 pairs breeding in 17 countries (BirdLife International in prep.), closely matching a new global estimate of <em>c.</em> 35,000 pairs (A. Aebischer <em>in litt. </em>2020). The global population is therefore estimated to be between 60,000-70,000 mature individuals. <br/><br/>This is a substantial increase from the numbers previously reported: 25,200-33,400 pairs for the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015), and 21,000-25,000 pairs in 2009.",Increasing,"This species is endemic to the western Palearctic, with the European population of 32,200-37,700 pairs, which equates to 64,400-75,400 mature individuals from an area encompassing more than 95% of the breeding range (A. Aebischer <em>in litt. </em>2020).&#160;It breeds from <strong style="""">Spain&#160;</strong>and <strong style="""">Portugal</strong> east through central Europe to <strong style="""">Ukraine</strong>, north to southern <strong style="""">Sweden</strong>, <strong style="""">Latvia</strong><strong style="""">&#160;</strong>and the <strong style="""">U.K.</strong><strong style=""""></strong>, and south to southern <strong style="""">Italy</strong>.

It is now only a winter visitor in small numbers to Morocco, having recently become extinct as a breeding species (Radi <em>et al. </em>2020). Its status as a breeding and wintering species in North Africa is now uncertain. <br/><br/>The largest breeding populations are now in Germany (14,000-16,000 pairs), the U.K. (4,388 pairs), Sweden (3,100-4,100 pairs), France (3,000-3,900 pairs), Switzerland (2,800-3,400 pairs) and Spain (2,312-2,440 pairs) (BirdLife International in prep., Knaus <em>et al. </em>2018). These six countries together now hold over 90% of the global population, indicating a shift in the core abundance of the species towards central and northern Europe, with conservation reintroductions contributing to some of this shift (Stevens <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species previously suffered a moderate to rapid decline, and the population overall declined by almost 20%&#160;during 1990-2000 (BirdLife International 2004). In&#160;Germany, the population is now stable (Gerlach&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019), though with regional variation (increases in the south and west, but stable or declining elsewhere [Grüneberg and Karthäuser 2019])&#160;and it is estimated the population is currently still 16% lower than&#160;in the late 1980s. Eastern German populations declined by 25-30% between 1991 and 1997, but then stabilised&#160;(Mammen 2000, Mammen and Stubbe 2002)<strong></strong>, whereas in the federal state Saxony-Anhalt the decline continued until 2006 (Mammen 2007). The populations of the northern foothills of the Harz Mts (the most densely populated part of its range) suffered an estimated 50% decline from 1991-2001 (<strong></strong>Nicolai and Weihe 2001)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>There is little consolidated data to judge the extent of declines in France during the last century, but comparing counts from 1980 and 2000 suggests a decline of up to 80% in some areas, during which time the species's range in France decreased by 15%<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(A. Mionnet&#160;<em>in litt</em><em>.</em>&#160;2005, Thiollay and Bretagnolle 2004)<strong></strong>. A national survey conducted in 2008 revealed a decline of more than 20% of the French breeding population over 6 years (David and Mionnet 2010), with the breeding population declining from 3,000-3,900 pairs in 2002<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong><strong></strong>(Mionnet 2007)<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>to 2,335-3,022 pairs in 2008 (Pinaud&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2009).&#160;The trend for the French population between 1998 and 2011 was estimated to be decreasing by 25% (BirdLife International 2015); however the trend now appears stable or even increasing locally (F. David&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). <br/><br/>In Spain the declining trend continued in the breeding population to the census in 2014, with the three generation population reduction using data from the 1994 and 2014 censuses being 44% (Molina 2015). Much of this decline is in the south, and the species is at risk of extirpation from Doñana National Park (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2019). The Balearic Islands population declined from 41-47 breeding pairs in 1993 to 27 in 2004<strong></strong>&#160;(Cardiel 2006); however, conservation actions have since enabled the population to recover, to 38 breeding pairs in 2007<strong>&#160;</strong>(Cardiel<em>&#160;in<em>&#160;litt</em></em><em>.</em>&#160;2007) and this trend has continued (Molina&#160;2015). A rapid decline is also thought to have occurred in Portugal, but without quantification except for a reported 50% reduction in the occupied area (H. Alonso <em>in litt. </em>2020): this was however based only on eBird records that include breeding codes, in comparison to the 1999-2005 breeding bird atlas (Equipa Atlas 2008).<br/><br/><span lang=""ES""><span lang=""ES""><span lang=""ES""><span lang=""ES""><span lang=""ES""><span lang=""ES""><span lang=""ES""><span lang=""ES""><span lang=""ES"">Populations elsewhere are generally stable or increasing.

The main ongoing cause of habitat conversion in Brazil is forestry, with developments for mining, hydroelectricity, roads, commercial premises and tourism also contributing (Urben-Filho and Costa Straube 2008, ICMBio 2013).&#160;In Argentina and Paraguay, grasslands have been converted to sown pastures for cattle ranching, and to arable agriculture&#160;(mainly soybean, sunflower, maize, wheat and rice) and tree plantations (pine and eucalyptus; Pearman and Abadie 1995, Lowen <em>et al.</em> 1996). Between 1985-1989 and 2002-2004, grassland cover within the&#160;Río de la Plata grassland region decreased from 67.4 to 61.4% and the area of agriculture increased from 22 to 25.9%, with declines in grassland being higher in Argentina, and some areas of flat pampas dominated by arable plantations (Baldi and Paruelo 2008). In western Uruguay, grasslands have been converted to plantations of soybean, wheat and corn (Paruelo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In Colombia, large areas of the Orinoco region have been converted to agriculture, and savannas have been converted to pastures and plantations of oil palm and crops, with a subsequent increase in the frequency of fires (Amaya-Villarreal 2016). The species's strict habitat requirements render it vulnerable to habitat degradation through overgrazing and fire. Conversion of land to oil palm plantations could pose a future threat (López-Ricaurte <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).","Although widespread and fairly common at a few localities, it is generally scarce and localised (Collar and Wege 1995, Parker and Willis 1997). Surveys in the Argentinian Pampas in 2006 to 2008 found the species to be rare, with records in only two of 30 transects (Codesido&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).<br/><br/>The global population size has not been quantified, but given the size of its range, it is assumed to be larger than 10,000 mature individuals (Collar and Wege 1995). The population in Argentina is suspected to number 2,500-10,000 mature individuals (MAyDS and Aves Argentinas 2017).

Recent data indicates that the rate of decline has slowed, although breeding data indicates continuing reductions in Scandinavia, and the trend in the Russian breeding population is unknown. Further information on the rate of decline here, as well as potential shifts in distribution and the drivers of the rapid past decline are needed to inform conservation actions.","The species breeds on wooded&#160;<strong><sup></sup></strong>coastlines, small freshwater lakes,&#160;pools and rivers&#160;in northern coniferous forests, wooded Arctic tundra&#160;and alpine zones, especially where there are boulder-covered or small rocky islands available for nesting with extensive herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and low trees&#160;(Johnsgard 1978,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992,&#160;Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005).&#160;The majority of birds winter at sea on shallow inshore coastal waters, especially in estuaries or inlets where there are large mussel-beds<strong></strong>&#160;(Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also occur on freshwater lakes and estuaries during migration<strong>&#160;</strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005).&#160;Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, as well as crustaceans, worms, echinoderms, amphipods, isopods, small fish, and (in freshwater habitats) adult and larval insects<strong>&#160;</strong>(del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Kear 2005). The species may also consume plant material on its breeding grounds&#160;(e.g. leaves and shoots)<strong></strong>&#160;(Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992).&#160;It mainly forages by diving and may feed at depths of 30-40 m during the winter (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1992)<strong></strong>.&#160;This species is highly migratory&#160;and breeds from mid-May onwards&#160;in solitary pairs or loose groups, occasionally nesting in association with gull or tern colonies<strong> </strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Kear 2005).<p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species, at present and in the future. Decreasing spring snow cover duration has been linked to declining Scoter populations in North America, likely due to trophic mismatch, and is likely to also affect Siberian populations (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification could lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of the Velvet Scoter diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Another major threat is bycatch in fishing gear, occurring particularly in wintering grounds (Dagys &amp; Hearn 2018). Population declines in the Baltic Sea have coincided with heavy bycatch mortality in gillnet fisheries and Velvet Scoters are amongst the most frequent victims as their foraging ecology puts them at high risk of entanglement (Dagys &amp; Žydelis 2002, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013, Dagys 2017).</p>  <p>Invasive species pose a threat to Velvet Scoters in parts of the range, but the extent of impacts are largely unknown at present (Almquist <em>et al.</em> 2010, Dagys 2017). Predation from introduced American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> may impair populations on Scandinavian islands (Nordstrom <em>et al.</em> 2002), and the Round Goby <em>Neogobius melanostomus</em> feeds on benthic invertebrates and may impact the abundance and distribution of Scoter food supplies.</p>  During moulting and winter aggregations, the species is highly susceptible to oil spills and other marine pollutants (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005, UICN France 2011) and one catastrophic oil spill occurring in a key moulting or wintering area could affect a large proportion of the global population (Madge &amp; Burn 1988). Velvet Scoter have been found to be susceptible to avian influenza (Melville &amp; Shortridge 2006) and future outbreaks of disease may be expected and could compound observed declines in parts of its range. The species is also hunted in some areas however, this is generally considered to be sustainable, with annual bags estimated to be between 1,600 and 2,800 individuals in Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006). Habitat degradation caused by sand-dredging operations, bottom-trawling fisheries and the installation of wind farms causes the loss, degradation or avoidance of feeding areas (Garthe and Huppop 2004, Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011, Dierschke <em>et al.</em> 2016, Dagys &amp; Hearn 2018), while additional habitat degradation on breeding grounds has resulted from human exploitation of natural resources such as marine benthic organisms and shellfish in the taiga and lower tundra regions (Kear 2005).<p></p><p></p>","Population data supplied the&#160;to the European Commission (EC) in late 2019 by Member States under Article 12 of the EU Birds Directive totalled 202,000-384,000 individuals.

This population appears to be at significant risk of extinction in the near future. <br/><br/>Since surveys in 1992-1993, when the estimate of the north-west European wintering population<em></em> was updated to c.1 million birds, an apparent rapid decline of&#160;<em>c.</em> 60% was detected in the Baltic Sea, with counts in 2007-2009 putting the wintering population at <em>c.</em> 373,000 individuals, down from c.933,000 in 1992-1993 (Skov <em>et al</em>. 2011). Subsequently, numbers in the main wintering areas appear largely stable (BirdLife International in prep., M. Ellermaa <em>in litt. </em>2020, N. Markones <em>in litt. </em>2020, S.

The EU breeding population, while a small portion of the global total (<em>c.&#160;</em>80% breed in Russia), is estimated to be declining at a rate of approximately 30% over the past three generations (BirdLife International in prep), and the population that winters in the Black Sea and Caspian region appears to be suffering a rapid decline on breeding grounds (S. Isfendiyaroglu <em>in litt. </em>2020, Paposhvili 2018).

For this reason, it is listed as Vulnerable.","This species inhabits humid, semi-deciduous and gallery forests, and is often recorded in woodland edges (del Hoyo 1994). Surveys in a variety of landscapes in the Brazilian Pantanal recorded 72% of individuals in closed forest habitats and 28% in open grassland, usually near forest edge (Desbiez and&#160;São Bernardo 2011). In Argentina, it appears to be restricted to gallery forest (MAyDS and Aves Argentinas 2017). It is primarily frugivorous but also has been noted feeding on seeds, flowers and invertebrates (del Hoyo and Motis 2004). Breeding evidence has been noted in the southern hemisphere summer in Paraguay and Argentina; nest is a platform located in a tree (del Hoyo and Motis 2004).","Although the species occupies a relatively large range, it has disappeared from parts of its former range as a result of habitat destruction and hunting (del Hoyo 1994). Deforestation, largely through conversion to arable crops and to pasture, remains a serious threat across the species's range. Selective logging further degrades habitat, including in Formosa, Argentina (Zalazar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Hunting pressure is an issue in Goiás, Tocantins and southern Pará (F.

In Bolivia, the species was previously considered to be fairly common (del Hoyo and Motis 2004), but more recently it was said to be rare to uncommon (Herzog <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Crax fasciolata </em>occurs in eastern&#160;<strong>Bolivia </strong>(<em>C. f. grayi</em>), with the nominate <em>C. f. fasciolata</em> occurring in central and south-west <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Paraguay </strong>and north <strong>Argentina</strong>. The nominate race occurs in Brazil from Sao Paulo, Paraná (at least formerly) and Mato Grosso do Sul, north through Minas Gerais, Goiás and Mato Grosso, and into Pará (del Hoyo 1994, WikiAves 2018). In Bolivia the species is widely distributed throughout the <em>llanos de moxos</em> (savannas), with many areas holding protected populations (B. Hennessey&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2003). In Argentina, populations remain only in Formosa, and in Chaco, where there have been recent reports from the Zapirán, Oro and&#160;Guaicurú rivers (Anon. 2018), and a record of a single female at Chaco National Park that may be an escaped or released captive individual (Bodrati and Lammertink 2011, MAyDS and Aves Argentinas 2017). It has disappeared from Corrientes (where it was last recorded in c.1980), Misiones and Santa Fe (MAyDS and Aves Argentinas 2017). In Paraguay, the species was previously thought to have been almost or completely extirpated from much of its range, but in 1999 the species was still relatively numerous in northern Concepción Department (Clay 2001). It is still recorded an annual basis in gallery forests in Concepción and Ñeembucú Departments, and a nest was discovered in 2011 in the Chaco-Pantanal area (H. del Castillo<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2014).",,Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation&#160; and research actions underway</strong><br/> The species is listed as nationally Endangered in Argentina (MAyDS and Aves Argentinas 2017) and nationally Vulnerable in Paraguay (Ministerio del Ambiente y Desarollo Sostenibile 2019).

It has a small area of occupancy and occurs at a small number of locations. Its population size remains small and is composed of small subpopulations. In the absence of continued habitat management and/or predator controls, its area of occupancy, area and quality of habitat, and population size would all likely decline. For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.<p></p>","In 1949, the remaining populations on Hawai‘i&#160;were restricted to rocky, sparsely vegetated, high volcanic slopes. Historically, the species is likely to have used grasslands, grassy shrublands, and dryland forest (USFWS 2004). It currently occurs in a variety of habitats including golf courses, pastures, lava flows, upland grasslands and shrublands (USFWS). The optimal habitat during the breeding and moulting seasons appears to be lowland grassland, including exotic grassland, where there is an abundance of high protein food, adjacent to natural scrubland nesting areas (Black <em>et al.</em> 1994, Black 1995<strong>, </strong>Black <em>et al.</em> 1997, Leopold and Hess 2013)<strong></strong>. During the non-breeding season it prefers subalpine shrubland (Leopold and Hess 2013, 2014). The species is likely to have originally been an altitudinal migrant, nesting primarily in leeward lowlands below 700m, and moving to montane habitats above 900 meters in the non-breeding season (Black 1995, USFWS 2004). Seasonal movements are now being seen in some recovered populations (USFWS 2004, 2011, Hess <em>et al.</em> 2012). Although a weak flier, the species is capable of flying between islands, and there have been several records of individuals flying between Maui and Hawai‘i&#160;(Banko and Elder 1990). It feeds on a wide range of plants (Banko <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). It breeds from August to April, with most eggs hatching in December and January (Banko <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999).<br/><p></p>","The species originally declined as a result of hunting by Polynesian and non-Polynesian people, habitat loss and the introduction of mammalian predators (USFWS 2004). Currently the main threats are predation by alien mammal species, habitat loss and degradation, and conflict with humans. Examination of carcasses from 1991-2013 found that emaciation, trauma from predation and road collisions, and diseases (predominantly toxoplasmosis)&#160;were the biggest causes of death (Work&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;<br/><br/>The introduced small Indian mongoose&#160;<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>&#160;occurs on all range islands except Kaua‘i, and is the main predator of eggs (Banko 1992, USFWS 2004). Eggs are also predated by Black, Norway and Pacific Rats (USFWS 2004). Dogs, mongooses and occasionally cats predate on goslings (Banko and Elder 1990, Banko 1992). Feral pigs trample nests and predate eggs, young and adults (USFWS 2004). Feral cats also carry the protozoan organism&#160;<em>Toxoplasma gondii&#160;</em>which causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that can be fatal in the species, although it is unlikely to be causing significant population-level impacts (Hess and Banko 2006, Work&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, 2016, USFWS 2018)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>A lack of suitable lowland habitat, especially for rearing young, may be an important factor limiting growth (USFWS 2004). The development of agricultural systems by the Polynesians, and later by European settlers, resulted in the extensive loss and alteration of habitat (Olson and James 1991)<strong></strong>. Lowland habitat continues to be lost through urbanisation and conversion to agriculture (USFWS 2018), and is being&#160;degraded through grazing by feral ugulates (cattle, goats and sheep) and by the introduction of alien plant species such as guinea grass (<em>Megathyrsus maximus</em>), sword grass (<em>Miscanthus floridulus</em>), koa haole (<em>Leucaena leucocephala</em>), and lantana (<em>Lantana camara; </em>Banko <em>et al.</em> 1999, VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2018).<br/><br/>Road-kills are an important cause of mortality on Hawai‘i&#160;(M. Morin&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999, Rave&#160;<em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span>&#160;2005, Lepczyk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019)<strong></strong>&#160;and probably on Maui (A. Marshall, D. Hu and K. Misajon<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2007)<strong></strong>.&#160;Wind farms may also cause mortality of adults, although this is expected to be offset by habitat conservation plans at wind farm sites (USFWS 2011, 2018).<br/>Populations have been found to have a low level of genetic diversity, which may affect the species's breeding success (Rave 1995).<p></p>Severe droughts can cause significant adult mortality, resulting in large population declines, and may become more frequent due to climate change (USFWS 2011, 2018). Climate change may also negatively affect the species through an increased frequency of cyclones, and through sea level rise, which may reduce the amount of available lowland breeding habitat (USFWS 2018). <br/><br/>Volcanic activity has the potential to destroy much or all of the habitat at Hawai‘i&#160;Volcanoes National Park and surrounding areas, but volcanoes are not considered to represent a threat to the species as a whole (USFWS 2019).","Recent population estimates have included 1,754 in 2006, 2,019 in 2007, 1,900 - 1,950 in 2008, 1,877 - 1,927 in 2009, 1,888 - 1,978 in 2010 (USFWS 2011), 2,465-2,555 in 2011 (VanderWerf 2012), 3,039 in 2015 (Amidon 2017), and 2,855 in 2016 (USFWS 2018). In 2018, the population was estimated at 3,252 individuals, including 1,104 on Hawai‘i&#160;(including 598 birds relocated from Kaua‘i), 627 on Maui, 37 on Moloka’i, 1,482 on Kaua‘i&#160;and 2 on O‘ahu&#160;(USFWS 2018).<br/><br/>For some time, all populations were dependent on continued releases of captive birds to persist (USFWS 2004), but releases ceased by the late 2000s (USFWS 2011). The populations on Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i&#160;Island and Maui are now considered to be self-sustaining (USFWS 2018). The population on Moloka’i is not yet successfully breeding (USFWS 2019), and so it is excluded from this assessment. In 2011-2016, 640 individuals were removed from a site on Kaua‘i&#160;to reduce the risk of bird strike at an airport, and moved to Hawai‘i&#160;and Maui (VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2018).<br/><br/>The total population size of all established subpopulations is here placed in the band 2,600 - 3,300 individuals, roughly equivalent to 1,700 - 2,200 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Although the species is capable of flying between islands (Banko and Elder 1990), it is assumed that subpopulations on separate islands are largely isolated.",Increasing,"<em>Branta sandvicensis</em> is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>). Fossil analysis suggests that it once occurred throughout the main islands (Olson and James 1991)<strong></strong>. However, it declined due to habitat loss and alteration, hunting, and and predation by introduced predators (Olson and James 1991), and by&#160;1951 only around 30 wild individuals remained, restricted to Hawai‘i Island&#160;(Smith 1952). Following an extensive reintroduction programme beginning in the 1960s, reintroduced populations are now also found on Maui, Kaua‘i and Moloka’i&#160;Islands. For some time, all populations were dependent on continued releases of captive birds to persist (USFWS 2004), but releases ceased by the late 2000s (USFWS 2011). The populations on Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i&#160;Island and Maui are now considered to be self-sustaining, although they continue to be reliant on predator control and habitat management (USFWS 2018).

Global and regional population  trends are difficult to determine, as the species is decreasing in some  range states (sometimes dramatically) whilst increasing in others.  Overall, it is not believed to approach the threshold for the population  decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in  ten years or three generations). For these reasons, it is evaluated as  Least Concern.","In the summer, both maternity colonies and males predominantly occupy  roosts in buildings, such as attics, voids behind sheathing and shutters  etc. It sometimes roosts in ventilation shafts of buildings or joints  in bridges. It prefers summer roosts which offer diverse microclimate,  so that the animals can choose their location according to the outdoor  temperature. Individual, mostly male serotines occasionally use tree  caves or nesting boxes (Baagoe 2001, Simon <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dietz <em>et al.</em>  2009). Nurseries usually consist of 10-60 female, but colonies of up to  300 females have also been reported. Sometimes there are also male  colonies with up to 20 individuals . Serotines hibernate mostly in deep  cavities in buildings at the distance of 40-50 km from a summer roost,  but records from underground sites are also quiet frequent (Dietz <em>et al.</em>  2009). <em>E. serotinus</em> is an edge and open-area specialist. It can glean  insects from vegetation or the ground but the predominant foraging  strategy is aerial hawking (Baagøe 2001). It usually forages around and  in the canopy of trees. In open pastures, it can fly close to the ground  or up to 20 m with sudden steep dives. The species often feeds along  roads and around street lamps. Main prey taxa are associated with  semi-open and open habitats such as meadows and pastures with tree  groups, hedges or woodland edges. The distance to foraging sites can  reach 5–7 km, but usually serotines spend around 90% of their foraging  time at distances smaller than 2 km from the maternity roost. A high  percentage of traditional feeding sites is used by the colonies in  subsequent years Faecal analyses of the serotine bat in different parts  of its European range revealed predominantly Coleoptera (e.g. Aphodius,  Melolonthinae, Necrophorus), Lepidoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera,  Hemiptera and Hymenoptera (see Kyheröinen <em>et al.</em> 2019 for the  review of literature). It is fairly sedentary bat species, with  movements up to 330 km recorded (Havekost 1960). It is known to attain  24 years (Steffens <em>et al.</em> 2007).","In Europe affected by habitat loss and disturbance and destruction of  colonies in houses and in underground hibernation sites. Renovation and  refurbishment of buildings, especially churches, lead to losses of  quarters and roosting possibilities. It also suffers from the  agricultural intensification due to loss of insect-rich meadows and  pastures as hunting grounds through abandonment of free-range farming,  more frequent mowing, increased fertilisation or conversion into arable  land. Loss of hunting grounds due to increased agricultural use (e.g.  through maize cultivation, energy crop cultivation, monocultures and  consequent disappearance of hedges, borders and small-scale structured,  insect-rich cultural and open landscapes is also a significant threat in  developed countries (Simon <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species is at high  risk of collisions with vehicles (Fensome, Mathews 2016). It is  sensitive to light pollution at daytime roosts, commuting routes,  drinking sites and in hibernacula (Voigt <em>et al.</em> 2018).The species  is a host of the rabies-related virus EBLV1. There is increasing  interest in the occurrence, risk to humans and epidemiology of this  virus (e.g. Stantic-Pavlinic 2005), which could have an effect on the  public image of this house-dependent bat.","In the EU, conservational status was favourable only in Pannonian  biogeographical region, whereas it was unfavourable-inadequate in  Alpine, Atlantic, Black Sea, Boreal, Continental, Mediterranean and  Steppic regions  (EEA 2013).

Lactating females foraged farther from the roost than  pregnant females. Their home range was 22,318 ± 7,141 ha vs. 10,837 ±  5,399 ha in the Rhône Valley. The foraging area of maternity colonies  was <em>ca</em> 200,000 ha. Lepidoptera dominated in the diet in all seasons and  comprised 76–95 % of the volume. Diptera (mainly Tipulidae in late  summer) was the second main prey in France versus Neuroptera in  Slovenia. Prey also included larvae of Lepidoptera and Aranaeidea, as  well as taxa flying close to vegetation. According to a DNA barcoding  study, Geometridae and Noctuidae were the most represented families of  the lepidopterans. Dipterans were the second most consumed prey. Several  taxa of Coleoptera, Neuroptera, Orthoptera and Trichoptera were also  recorded. Prey also included many pest arthropod species (see Kyheröinen  <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018 for the literature review). Schreiber's bat is  a migrant species which changes its roosts several times during the  year, long-distance movements occur occasionally (the longest recorded  distance is 833 km: Hutterer <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). The maximum known age is 22 years (Gazaryan 2004).","The main threat to this bat is disturbance to colonies, both in winter and summer  roosts. Unsuitable physical protection of cave entrances (e.g. with  improperly designed grilles) may lead to abandonment or decline in  numbers. In 2002, mass mortality events were reported for populations in  France, Spain and Portugal, there are also historical records for such  mortality in Italy. Hundreds of individuals were found dead in spring.  Mortality up to 60% in one year was reported from France (Roué, Némoz  2002), and 40% mortality occurred in Spain during the same period  including 1,000 dead individuals out of 6,000 in one colony. A number of  sites were subsequently deserted. In 2013, a mass-mortality incident  occurred in a <em>Miniopterus schreibersii</em> bat colony, causing the death of ~500  individuals in Northeast Hungary (Bükk mountains). Mortality events in  Spain and Hungary were both associated with the Lloviu virus (Kemenesi <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2018). Another event with <em>ca</em> 200 casualties of uncertain origin was  reported in 2018 from Georgia (EUROBATS 2018). Mortality at wind  turbines was recorded from Spain, Portugal and France, but may occur  everywhere within the range (Rodrigues <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).","The global population of <em>Miniopterus schreibersiii </em>is estimated to have declined by at least 30% throughout much of its range.&#160;Extinction has occurred in Germany (Germany 2018), Ukraine (Ukraine  2018) and Austria (Spitzenberger 2019). In Switzerland the species has  declined since the 1960s. Migrating bats were sometimes recorded in  caves along the French border, but no colonies had been revealed  (Bohnenstenge <em>et al.</em> 2014). In Romania, half of the roosts have  disappeared since the 1960s. Population in Serbia estimated at 150,000  without any conspicuous trend (Pejić <em>et al.</em> 2018).

Sixteen known or suspected mortality factors were identified and ranked at an expert workshop with a decrease in the amount of carrion (particularly during chick-rearing), inadvertent poisoning, electrocution on pylons or collision with cables, loss of foraging habitat and unsustainable harvesting for traditional uses considered the most important factors (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, Barnes 2000, Benson 2000, Borello and Borello 2002<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>, Boshoff and Anderson 2007). The primary threats are currently thought to be contamination of their food supply and possibly a shortage in food supply, negative interactions with human infrastructure and hunting for use in the traditional health industry (Allan 2015). Further threats include disturbance at colonies, bush encroachment and drowning (Anderson 1999, Borello and Borello 2002<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>, Bamford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007)<strong></strong>. In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007, Anon. 2008)<strong></strong>. It is estimated that 160 vultures are sold and that there are 59,000 vulture-part consumption events in eastern South Africa each year, involving an estimated 1,250 hunters, traders and healers. At current harvest levels, the populations of this species in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho could become locally extinct within 44-53 years. Should the populations of<em> </em>White-backed Vultures <em>G. africanus</em> become depleted first, the resultant increase in hunting pressure on <em>G. coprotheres</em> could cause a population collapse within the subsequent 12 years (McKean and Botha 2007, Anon. 2008)<strong></strong>. Extrapolation from a limited study of traditional healers in Maseru, Lesotho, suggests that, conservatively, nearly 7% of the breeding population in that country would be lost annually for such use<strong></strong><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Beilis and Esterhuizen 2005). A study in South Africa found that should current rates of exploitation for market trade continue then the populations in Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape could be exhausted within 54 years (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The species suffers mortality from the ingestion of poison left for pests (not vultures) (Diekmann and Strachan 2006) and potentially diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses&#160;(BirdLife International news www.birdlife.org/news 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

A single poisoning incident can kill 50-500 birds, making the species susceptible to sudden local declines (M. Diekmann<em> in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. The collapse of a key colony in eastern Botswana has been attributed to human disturbance, especially insensitive tourism<strong></strong> (Borello and Borello 2002). The ongoing urbanisation around Hartbeespoort Dam and the Magaliesberg Mountains, South Africa, has limited the extent of natural areas for foraging by vultures, perhaps resulting in their reliance on supplementary food at vulture ""restaurants"" <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Wolter <em>et al</em>. 2007). If such restaurants were closed, vultures might be exposed to unsafe carcasses <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Wolter <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Poor grassland management in some areas has promoted bush encroachment, making finding carcasses more difficult for vultures (Schultz 2007, Bamford <em>et al. </em>2009). There are records of at least 120 individuals (21 incidents) of this species drowning in small farm reservoirs in southern Africa between the early 1970s and late 1990s (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1999), although modifications to many reservoirs have now been made (Boshoff <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009)<strong></strong>. Raptors are thought to drown after attempting to bathe or drink, with mass vulture drownings probably due to the triggering of group behaviour by the actions of one bird (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In Magaliesberg a large number of fatalities have been associated with powerline collisions and electrocutions, and this is one of the main factors causing the ongoing decline of the species in South Africa (K. Wolter <em>in litt</em>. 2007). It is estimated that a minimum of 80 vultures are killed annually by collision with powerlines in Eastern Cape Province (Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 2011). Also, due to an increase in incident reporting in South Africa, it is becoming evident that this threat to the species is severe. The strategic partnership between The Endangered Wildlife Trust and South Africa’s energy supplier, Eskom, has been recording wildlife-energy infrastructure interactions since October 1996. This database has 403 incidents involving the Cape Vulture; totaling 1,022 individuals, of which 866 individuals have died as a result of electrocution incidents on power lines, while 156 have been killed colliding with overhead cables (S. Page-Nicholson and C. Hoogstad <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>A controversial wind farm development in Maluti-Drakensberg, Lesotho, an important site for Cape Vulture was given approval in 2014 (Anon. 2014), and even relatively small-scale wind energy developments in the Lesotho Highlands pose a threat to the species (Rushworth and Krüger 2014), especially as, even after rehabilitation, injured (or poisoned) individuals have increased mortality compared to individuals of a similar age (Monadjem <em>et al. </em>2014). It is reported that a lack of adult females in the relict Namibian population may have led to four males breeding with <em>G. africanus</em>, although this is not thought to be a problem across southern Africa (Diekmann and Strachan 2006). Patterns in the contraction of the species's range since the 1950s imply that climate change could be an underlying factor driving its decline through changes in habitats and decreases in prey populations, though further research is required to confirm a link (Simmons and Jenkins 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.  <p></p>","In 2006, the total population was estimated at 8,000-10,000 individuals (M. Diekmann <em>in litt.</em> 2006), roughly equivalent to 5,300-6,700 mature individuals. The global population estimate has been revised with an estimate of 4,700 pairs or 9,400 mature individuals (Allan 2015). Based on surveys, Hirschauer <em>et al.</em> (2020) estimated that the species's stronghold in the north-east, contained 3,560 breeding pairs, and that the stronghold contained 56-74% of the global population of mature individuals.&#160;<br/><br/>If the 3,560 breeding pairs represent 56% of the population, then the global population size may equate to 6,357 breeding pairs (12,714 mature individuals). If the stronghold represents 74% of the population, the global population size may equate to 4,810 breeding pairs (9,621 mature individuals). The population size is therefore placed in the band of 9,621-12,714 mature individuals, rounded here to 9,600 - 12,800 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is found in <strong>South Africa</strong> where overall numbers were previously thought to be decreasing (Vernon 1999, Barnes 2000, Benson 2000<strong></strong>) with a minimum of 630 pairs at 143 colonies and 2000 individuals in the Eastern Cape and 39% of colonies recorded between 1987-1992 now inactive (Boshoff <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009), however, more recent data from the northern provinces suggests that the number of 'active' nests has increased since 2000 and a similar increase may be occurring in the Eastern Cape Province (Benson 2015, Pfeiffer <em>et al. </em>2016,&#160;P.

It is estimated that 160 vultures are sold and that there are 59,000 vulture-part consumption events in eastern South Africa each year, involving an estimated 1,250 hunters, traders and healers. At current harvest levels, the populations of this species in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho could become locally extinct within 44-53 years. Should the populations of<em>&#160;</em>White-backed Vultures&#160;<em>G. africanus</em>&#160;become depleted first, the resultant increase in hunting pressure on&#160;<em>G. coprotheres</em>&#160;could cause a population collapse within the subsequent 12 years (McKean and Botha 2007, Anon. 2008)<strong></strong>. Extrapolation from a limited study of traditional healers in Maseru, Lesotho, suggests that, conservatively, nearly 7% of the breeding population in that country would be lost annually for such use<strong></strong><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>(Beilis and Esterhuizen 2005). A study in South Africa found that should current rates of exploitation for market trade continue then the populations in Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape could be exhausted within 54 years (McKean&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. It is legally protected throughout its range. A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian vultures was produced in 2017 (CMS 2017), and a Biodiversity Management Plan is being produced by the Cape Vulture Task Force, driven by The Endangered Wildlife Trust and BirdLife South Africa (S. Page-Nicholson and C. Hoogstad <em>in litt. </em>2016). Some breeding colonies lie within protected areas (Barnes 2000, Theron 2013)<strong></strong>. Non-governmental organisations have successfully raised awareness among farming communities in South Africa of the plight of this species (Barnes 2000). Many nestlings of this species were colour-ringed in southern Africa in the 1970s and 1980s<strong> </strong>(Botha 2006). The national electricity supplier in South Africa, in partnership with The Endangered Wildlife Trust, has replaced pylons in some regions with a design that reduces electrocution risk to large birds (Barnes 2000, S. Page-Nicholson and C. Hoogstad <em>in litt. </em>2016), and breeding numbers have increased in some areas (Hirschauer <em>et al.</em> 2020). <br/><br/>Supplementary feeding at vulture restaurants may have helped to slow declines in some areas (Barnes 2000). The establishment of a restaurant at Nooitgedacht, South Africa, is thought to have helped promote the recolonisation of the former colony there, and another restaurant has possibly contributed the species's recovery in Magaliesberg <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Wolter <em>et al</em>. 2007). Supplementary feeding is known to significantly increase the survival rate of first-year birds in the Western Cape Province of South Africa (Piper <em>et al</em>. 1999), and appears to have increased the number of breeding pairs at the Mzimkhulu colony in southern KwaZulu-Natal (Schabo <em>et al. </em>2016), although there seems to not have been an effect on breeding success (Schabo <em>et al. </em>2016). Additionally, in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, adult vultures did not appear to be dependent on vulture restaurants, but could find enough food from subsistence rural farmland (Pfeiffer <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>Thirty-seven individuals were held in captivity in Namibia in 2011, with 7 breeding pairs from which at least 2 chicks have been hatched (Anon. 2011). The VulPro project in South Africa holds over 80 non-releasable Cape Vultures in captivity, this includes 10 breeding pairs, with the first successful hatching in September 2011 (Wolter 2011, Wolter <em>et al</em>. 2014). The programme aims to release captive-born chicks into the wild to supplement wild populations. In February 2015, seven birds from VulPro and three from the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa were released into an open-topped enclosure so that they could eventually disperse into the wild (Hirschauer 2015). In October 2005, 16 birds from South Africa were released in Namibia and, although at least two perished (Diekmann and Strachan 2006). Data on flight patterns and breeding behaviour have been recorded from two birds that were fitted with satellite transmitters (Anon. 2006). By 2006, five birds had been fitted with satellite tracking collars (Diekmann and Strachan 2006, Bamford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007). In Namibia, both communal and commercial farmers have been educated about the benefits that vultures bring and thus the disadvantages of poisoning carcasses, whilst there is also an education centre and education programme for schools (Diekmann and Strachan 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>A press release was circulated in July 2007 to raise awareness of the impacts of hunting for medicinal and cultural reasons in southern Africa (McKean and Botha 2007)<strong></strong>. The threat posed by anti-inflammatory drugs in southern Africa is under investigation (K. Wolter <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. The Hawk Conservancy and The Endangered Wildlife Trust are   currently providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning   teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to  respond  to a neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). An expert workshop on the species's conservation was held in South Africa in March 2006<strong> </strong>(Boshoff and Anderson 2006). Rehabilitation and release of injured vultures has become an important conservation action (Allan 2015). The species is listed as Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini, and Critically Endangered in Namibia (Allan 2015, Simmons and Brown 2015).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Develop conservation plans for each of the 18 'core' colonies through the Cape Griffon Task Force (Boshoff and Anderson 2007, Jenkins 2010).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over 10 years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in 10&#160; years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <p></p>","<p><strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is mainly migratory, with birds from Europe and northern Asia wintering in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Those at lower latitudes do not tend to be full migrants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrating birds leave their breeding grounds between July and October, arriving back between February and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is generally a gregarious species, with birds often roosting communally and observed in scattered flocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat</strong> It is found ubiquitously throughout habitats, although avoiding dense woodland, and is recorded foraging up to 2,400 m in Malawi (Global Raptor Information Network 2020). <strong>Diet</strong> An extremely versatile feeder, it takes carrion as well as live birds, mammals, fish, lizards, amphibians and invertebrates, and is even known to forage on vegetable matter such as palm oil fruits; human refuse has become a plentiful food source in many areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is usually built on the fork or branch of a tree (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> The species has become highly commensal with people and thrives in human-dominated environments, but modernisation of cities appears to reduce its breeding success (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).</p>","<p>The species is suspected to be declining in common with a other scavenging birds in sub-Saharan Africa (Virani <em>et al. </em>2011), and is likely to be impacted by poisoning (e.g. carcass poisoning or through ingestion of lead shot), shooting and the pollution of water&#160;by pesticides and other chemicals (Thiollay 2007; Orta <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is possible that the species suffers excess mortality due to poorly sited energy infrastructure, but the extent to which this may be impacting populations of this species is uncertain but thought likely negligible: the species does not concentrate in migratory bottlenecks as do related species.&#160;<br/></p>","There are no estimates of the global population size of the species. Parker (2005) estimated 1,000 birds to be present, presumably breeding in central Mozambique. The abundance of the species in much of sub-Saharan Africa indicates that the population is likely to be very large. In the Western Cape a rapid increase has been recorded between the 1950s and 1960s and 1997-1998 (Herremans and Herremans-Tonnoeyr 2001), but in other parts of the range a rapid reduction in the numbers detected during driven transects has been reported (Thiollay 2007; Garbett <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). While there is little solid data, it is suspected that the population is slowly declining.<p></p>",Decreasing,"The species occurs virtually throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the Comoro Islands and Madagascar, and from coastal east Africa to Egypt and the south west Arabian Peninsular. Estimates of population size are largely lacking, but the species is considered to be likely the most abundant diurnal raptor in Africa (Orta <em>et al. </em>2020). While birds may be present in almost the entire range at almost any time of year (eBird 2020), there are clear movements of migratory breeders to the south in the austral summer, reaching southernmost points in August-September (Global Raptor Information Network 2020). In west Africa, most individuals arrive towards the end of the rainy season (Global Raptor Information Network 2020), but again birds are often observed throughout the year (eBird 2020).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,Repeated monitoring of scavenging birds is required throughout sub-Saharan Africa to improve the ability to detect declines.,Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Its population size is inferred to be declining due to ongoing habitat degradation and predation by invasive American Mink. For these reasons, the species is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It occurs in marshy steppe wetlands, where there are large patches of dense and tall (c.2&#160;m) rushbeds <em>Schoenoplectus</em> (<em>Scirpus</em>) <em>californicus</em>, usually surrounded by wet meadows with&#160;lush green grass, and associated with a permanent water body, such as a river, stream or lake (Mazar Barnett <em>et al</em>. 1998, A. Jaramillo <em>in litt</em>. 2000, Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003, Mazar Barnett <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It appears to leave sites with less favourable habitat during the winter, and some northerly post-breeding dispersal or possibly partial migration may occur, at least in southern populations (Mazar Barnett <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2014).","Intensive grazing by cattle and sheep has degraded wet grassland and marshes across much of the species's current and historic range, especially in the Tierra del Fuego steppe (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In surveys, the species was not recorded at sites that had been degraded through overgrazing (Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003, Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, de Miguel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Overgrazing continues to pose a threat at some localities where the species has been recorded, such as at El Zurdo, Santa Cruz (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, S. Imberti <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). However, two of the most important populations, at Estancias Brazo Norte and La Angostura, are currently managed appropriately with only light grazing (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Marshes at La Soledad and El Sosiego ranches are also subject only to light grazing (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Burning and harvesting of aquatic vegetation to promote spring growth and to produce hay for cattle may also be pressures<strong></strong>&#160;(Fjeldså 1988). These practices are now much less common than they were in the past (Blanco and Canevari 1995, Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014), but surveys in Santa Cruz found that the species's population density was negatively affected by habitat burning (de Miguel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Burning leads to a decreased density of rushes, making the habitat less favourable to the Austral Rail (de Miguel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>Water extraction for agriculture and other purposes, and modification of watercourses through canalisation and damming also negatively impact on wetlands (J. Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2000, 2003, Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003). Important populations at Estancia El Sosiego and near Punta Banderas, Parque Nacional Los Glaciares, would be flooded by the completion of two dams that are being constructed on the Río SantaCruz, affecting the natural outflow of Lago Argentino (de Miguel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>Habitat in Central Chile, where the species was recorded historically, has been degraded via firewood extraction and conversion to agriculture (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Any further development of further intensive agriculture in suitable river valleys is likely to involve irrigation and wetland drainage and thus the loss of wetland habitat (Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003).<br/><br/>The species is also threatened by invasive American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>, which may have played a role in the species's decline (Fraga 2000, Mazar Barnett <em>et al. </em>2014). The mink is present in northern&#160;Magallanes and&#160;Santa Cruz, including in some river basins inhabited by the Austral Rail, and its range is expanding (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Fasola and Roesler 2016). Surveys in Santa Cruz found that the species's population density and site occupancy were negatively affected by the presence of mink (de Miguel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).","The species's population size is poorly known, but given that there were no documented records from 1959 to 1998, it is likely to be rare. It is fairly common at a handful of sites, with no known locality holding a population of more than c.35 individuals (Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, 2014,&#160;<strong></strong>Imberti and Mazar Barnett 1999).&#160;Extensive surveys carried out between 1998 and 2006 at 58 wetlands distributed over an area of c.700,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;detected a maximum of 175 individuals in total, at 22 localities that collectively held approximately 85 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of habitat&#160;(Mazar Barnett&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2014). Surveys in Santa Cruz in 2009-2013 detected at least one individual at each of two more localities (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Given the difficulty of detecting the species, there are likely to be undetected individuals. Nevertheless, the total population size is very unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, and could plausibly be less than 2,500 mature individuals (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014), so it&#160;is here placed in the band 1,000-9,999 mature individuals, with a best estimate in the range 2,500 - 9,999 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The subpopulation structure is poorly known, but a record of a vagrant individual in the Falkland Islands indicates that the species is able to disperse over large distances, so there is likely to be a degree of connectivity between habitat fragments. The population is therefore assumed to have a single subpopulation.",Decreasing,"<em style=""font-style: italic;"">Rallus antarcticus </em>is known from southern <strong>Chile</strong> and <strong>Argentina</strong>.

The species has been recorded historically in Tierra del Fuego, Buenos Aires, and Rio Negro, Santa Cruz and Chubut in Argentina, and in Valparaiso, Santiago, Colchagua, Llanquihue and Magallanes in Chile. It was previously known from just a few specimens and sight records, and since 1959, there were no documented records until the species was rediscovered in 1998, at&#160;Estancia La Angostura, Santa Cruz, Argentina (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.&#160;</em>1998).&#160;Further fieldwork in 1998-2006 recorded the species at a total of 21 localities in in Santa Cruz, Chubut, Buenos Aires and Rio Negro,&#160;Argentina, and in Magallanes (XII Region), Chile (Imberti and Mazar Barnett 1999, Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003, Pugnali&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Soave&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Mazar Barnett <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Surveys in Santa Cruz in 2009-2013 detected the species at two more localities (Roesler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Records from Buenos Aires, Rio Negro and the&#160;Valdes Peninsula were made outside the breeding season and may have represented migratory or vagrant individuals (Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Pugnali&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160; A record from the&#160;Falkland Islands (Malvinas) is likely to have been a vagrant individual, suggesting a&#160;tendency to undergo long-distance movements (Pugnali&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). All recent records fall outside the historical range, suggesting a large range contraction (J. Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2000, 2003). Nesting has been confirmed only in Torres del Paine&#160;National Park, Chile (Matus <em>et al.</em> 2017) and in a locality adjacent to Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina (Moroni and Salvador 2016).<br/><p></p>",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed as nationally Endangered in Argentina (MAyDS and Aves Argentinas 2017).

It is therefore listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It occurs in lowland tropical forest, typically below 900 m but locally to 2,000 m. It appears to have some tolerance of degraded forest and human-modified landscapes, as long as the forest matrix remains and there are sufficient large trees for nesting sites (Alverez-Cordero 1996; Aguiar-Silva 2016; Bowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020) and sufficient availability of prey (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021a). It will nest where high-grade forestry has been practised, and uses forest patches within a pasture/forest mosaic for hunting (Bierregaard 1994; Álvarez-Cordero 1996; Parker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996)<strong></strong>.&#160;However, it is mostly likely to be found in forest with at least 70% cover, and tends to avoid areas of cultivated land (Sutton 2021). A study in the Arc of Deforestation in Brazil found that it requires canopy vertebrate prey for successful breeding, and is unable to tolerate landscapes with less than 50% forest cover remaining (Miranda <em>et al. </em>2021a). It does not usually cross forest gaps of more than c.500 m (Aguiar-Silva 2016). It nests in very large trees of species such as&#160;<em>Ceiba pentandra</em>,&#160;<em>Swietenia</em>&#160;sp.,&#160;<em>Enterolobium contortisiliquum</em>,&#160;<em>Tabebuia impetiginosa</em>,&#160;<em>Berthorelia excelsa</em>,&#160;<em>Cavanillesia platanifolia</em>,&#160;<em>Cedrelinga catenaeiformis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Huberodendron&#160;</em>sp. (Muñiz-López 2008). In the Amazon, it appears to nest in only 28 species of tree (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). It typically nests below 310 m (Piana 2007; Muñiz-López 2008, 2016; González and Vargas 2011). It has been recorded feeding on a wide range of mostly mammalian prey species, including opossoms, primates, anteaters, sloths, armadillos, porcupines, agouties, carnivores and deer, as well as some large bird species (Alvarez-Cordero 1996; Miranda 2018), but in the Arc of Deforestation the majority of its diet consists of arboreal mammals, even in highly deforested areas (Miranda <em>et al. </em>2021a).","The main threats to the species are forest loss and degradation, and hunting, poaching and persecution. Collision with powerlines is an additional source of mortality (Banhos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018; Gusmão&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>Although it is not consumed as food, the species is targeted by hunters, and is frequently killed across much of its large range (Trinca&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008; Giraldo-Amaya&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021; A. Monroy-Ojeda <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021). It is sometimes persecuted with the intention of protecting livestock, or purely to satisfy curiosity (Trinca&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008; DeLuca 2012; Miranda <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021b).&#160;Roughly a third of the Amazon basin is indigenous territory, and within these areas the species is frequently poached&#160;by indigenous groups for the use of its feathers in traditional headdresses, arrow fletching or souvenirs, or to be kept or traded as a 'mascot'&#160;(Alvarez-Cordero&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996; Piana 2018; E. Miranda <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2021). It can be found for sale at live animal markets (Piana 2018). Increasing penetration of illicit mining operation, armed groups and farmers into previously intact forests in large parts of the species's South American range (C. Sharpe <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021) may lead to increased poaching and persecution. From the 1980s to 1990s, at least 45 Harpy Eagles were shot or poached in Venezuela alone (Alvarez-Cordero 1996). Of 18 individuals released in Panama and Belize and for which the cause of death was known, eight individuals were shot (Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Studies have found that shooting resulted in the death of 2.59 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup> annually in the Arc of Deforestation, which may quickly lead to local population depletion or extirpation (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021b; E. Miranda <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>Forest continues to be lost and degraded across much of the species's range, and particularly in southeast Amazonia and in Central America (Global Forest Watch 2021). Little forest now remains in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Forest is lost due to conversion to agriculture (crops and pasture), development of hydroelectric power plants and road-building (Banhos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), and remaining forest is degraded due to selective logging, escaped fires and illegal mining. Almost all of the few species of tree used for nesting are favoured for commercial use for timber (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Selective logging may therefore reduce the availability of nesting trees for the species, and may result in the death of nestlings (Vargas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006; Aguiar-Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014; Banhos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018; Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Loss of canopy cover may lead to a reduction in the abundance of prey species, thereby decreasing the quality of habitat for the Harpy Eagle (Miranda <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021a), although a study in Peru found that the Harpy Eagle is able to survive in secondary forest by feeding on prey species that are tolerant of disturbance (Bowler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). A model projected that the species's range may contract by 7-14% by 2090 as a result of climate change (Sutton 2021).<br/><p></p>","The species is generally rare throughout its range. It has a very large territory and is patchily distributed (Thiollay 1989). In Brazil, it is most common in Amazonia, and rare in the Atlantic forest (Banhos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is now very scarce in Mexico (A.

In the arc of deforestation in Mato Grosso, Brazil, the species was recorded at a nest density of 1.97–4.84 nests/100 km<sup>2</sup> of forest habitat, or 0.79–3.07 nests/100 km<sup>2 </sup>where deforested areas were included in the calculation (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021a).<br/><br/>National population size estimates have included 1,000-2,000 mature individuals in French Guiana (MNHN, UICN France and GEPOG 2018), 5,000-10,000 individuals (roughly equivalent to 3,300-6,700 mature individuals) in Peru (Piana 2018) and 806-1,208 pairs (equivalent to 1,612-2,416 mature individuals) in Panama, which was thought likely to be an overestimate (Vargas González&#160;and Vargas 2011).<br/><br/>Based on the minimum and median of the above density estimates for Panama, the estimated area of tree cover with at least 50% canopy cover within the mapped range in 2020 (below 310 m and total: approximately 76,700 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and 108,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>; Global Forest Watch 2021), the population size in Central America is inferred to be within the range of 11,000-22,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 7,600-15,000 mature individuals.<br/>Based on the minimum and median of the above density estimates for Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil, the estimated area of tree cover with at least 50% canopy cover within the mapped range in 2020 (below 310 m and total: approximately 4,380,000 km<sup>2 </sup>and 6,027,000 km<sup>2</sup>; Global Forest Watch 2021), the population size in South America is inferred to be within the range of 160,000-421,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 110,000-281,000 mature individuals. <br/><br/>The global population size is therefore tentatively estimated to fall within the range 118,000-225,000 mature individuals. Hunting and selective logging are likely to have depleted population densities across large parts of the species's range, so the true population size may be lower; to account for uncertainty, the population size is here placed in the band 100,000-250,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Genetic analysis in Brazil suggested a single subpopulation in the country (Banhos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), so the species is suspected to have a single subpopulation.",Decreasing,"<em>Harpia harpyja</em> has an extensive range in southern&#160;<strong>Mexico </strong>(Monroy-Ojeda <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), <strong>Guatemala</strong>, <strong>Belize </strong>(B.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>The species is a migrant, likely wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Yang <em>et al</em>. 2021). Birds leave their breeding grounds in September, returning in April and May. It is usually solitary, but may hunt in pairs, and travels in flocks on migration which become especially large at certain bottlenecks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Snow and Perrins 1998). It is sometimes active at twilight, and frequently migrates at night using flapping flight (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>Inhabits deciduous forests, often near water, including plantations, orchards and vineyards, and usually ranges up to 1,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Habitat use at non-breeding grounds is little known, but thornscrub is suspected to be favoured over tropical forest (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001)&#160;<strong>Diet </strong>Lizards and large insects (the latter especially in Africa) make up the majority of its diet (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).

Following the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the proportion of juvenile birds migrating over Eilat, Israel decreased, leading researchers to suggest that radioactive contamination may have resulted in a decrease in reproductive success (Yosef and Fornasari 2004).","The population is estimated to number in the tens of thousands.&#160;The European population is estimated at 7,700-15,300 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.), however this is likely to be an underestimate due to difficulties with identification and the species's secretive nature.&#160;Europe forms approximately 75-94% of the global range (BirdLife International 2004), so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 8,190-20,400 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. Large numbers of migratory birds have been recorded passing over Eilat, Israel - between 32,878 and 60,390 individuals were counted each year during autumn migration surveys from 1990-1999 (average = 45,333) (Alon <em>et al</em>. 2004), suggesting that the global population may be much higher.

It is therefore listed as Endangered.<p></p>","It is restricted to deciduous or semi-deciduous dry forest growing on limestone outcrops or limestone derived soils. This <em>caatinga</em> type habitat is an isolated island within surrounding <em>cerrado</em> savannah, pasture and agricultural lands. Dry forest typically has a closed canopy and dense understorey with lianas and some cacti, particularly in disturbed areas. The species has been seen in degraded and fragmented forest patches (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997). It leaves forest to feed in rice fields, on planted fruits such as mangoes and guava, and on seeds in degraded areas such as abandoned pastures and road verges (Bianchi 2010, Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). It does not&#160;usually venture more than 300 m outside forest with limestone outcrops (Bianchi 2010), although a small flock has been recorded 1.5 km from the nearest forest with limestone outcrops (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). It feeds on flowers, fruits and seeds, sometimes on the ground and typically in groups.&#160;It also consumes minerals obtained from the rocky walls of the limestone outcrops or from the banks of small rivers and streams (Dornas <em>et al. </em>2016). It breeds between October and January (Bianchi 2008).<p></p>","The principal threat to this species is deforestation driven by selective logging, fires and habitat conversion to pasture or soybean plantations (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997; Bianchi 2008). Dry forest in Goiás decreased in extent from 15.8 % of the state in 1990 to only 5.8 % in 1999, and less than 1 % of the remaining fragments were larger than 100 ha<strong>&#160;</strong>(Andahur 2001). As the area of remaining forest has decreased, the rate of conversion to pasture and plantations has lessened, but selective logging continues to degrade and remove remaining forest (T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Logging mainly targets durable woods that include most of the species's native foodplants, for use as fence poles and for improvements to farms (T. Dornas&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). It is likely that logging reduces the availability of hollow trees for nesting (T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Cement companies are beginning to target areas of limestone outcrops<strong>&#160;</strong>(C. A. Bianchi&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006). Small areas of forest are flooded as the result of the construction of small hydroelectric power plants (Dornas and Pinheiro 2018). Future hydroelectric plant developments in tributaries such as the Inferno and&#160;São Domingos rivers could potentially flood thousands of hectares of remaining habitat (T. Dornas, <em>pers. comm</em>., in Dornas and Pinheiro 2018; T. Dornas <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Recently, small scale sugarcane and soybean plantations are replacing old pastures in some areas in the surroundings of Terra Ronca State Park, the only conservation unit with significant size within the species’s range (T. Dornas <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>The species is rarely recorded in trade or exotic bird collections but this poses a potential threat (Olmos <em>et al</em>. 1997).

Based on an estimated remaining area of forest in 1995 of c.2,700 km<sup>2</sup> and a population density of 60-75 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>, the population size was estimated at 162,000 - 202,500 individuals, although it was noted that this may have been an overestimate because the area where surveys took place may have contained more remaining habitat than other parts of the species's range (Olmos <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997).<br/><br/>Surveys across the species's range in 2007-2008 estimated the density to be 11.7 (9-15) individuals per km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Bianchi 2010). Based on an estimated area of remaining forest of&#160;4,352 km<sup>2</sup>, the population size was estimated at&#160;39,168–65,280 individuals (Bianchi 2010).<br/><br/>In 2020, the population was suspected to fall in the range of 20,000 - 25,000 individuals (T.

Soaring flight is used frequently (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is always seen singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>It inhabits mature woodland, particularly coniferous, but also deciduous or mixed, preferring areas near clearings and the forest edge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Small birds and mammals make up the vast majority of its diet, with grouse, pheasants and partridges being especially important in boreal zones (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built on the forks or branches of large trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994), typically in areas with high (60-90%) canopy closure (Squires <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). <strong>Management information </strong>The species's optimal habitat appears to be areas of farmland interspersed with mature forest; afforestation has improved its status across parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Significant declines in Europe in the 19th-20th centuries are thought to have resulted from persecution and deforestation, with later declines in the 1950s-1960s a result of poisoning from pesticides and heavy metals. Studies on Northern Goshawk nestlings in Norway show that persistent organic pollutants are still present in plasma, preen oil and feathers, suggesting recent and continuous exposure (Briels <em>et al. </em>2019). Persecution continues to be a threat, as is nest robbing for falconry (Orta and Marks 2014). It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind farm developments (Strix 2012). Timber harvest is a primary threat to nesting populations, with nests and nest stands regularly destroyed or by logging operations, but the impact on breeding success is unknown (Squires <em>et al</em>. 2020, Byholm <em>et al. </em>2020). Disturbance caused by logging activity near nests can also cause nest failure (Boal and Mannan 1994). In Alaska, U.S.A, clear-cut, even-aged, short-rotation forest management reduces habitat quality for the species, as does removal of old growth forest patches (Iverson <em>et al</em>. 1996). Increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in western North America are causing a reduction in suitable roosting and foraging sites (Blakey <em>et al. </em>2020). Declines in some European countries are associated with reduced food supply following intensification of farming and forestry and increased competition for nest sites from Eagle Owls <em>Bubo bubo</em>&#160;(Rutz <em>et al. </em>2006).","The European population is estimated at 234,000-380,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International In prep.).

Birds migrate in a broad front across the Mediterranean Sea, not concentrating at bottleneck sites to the extent that many other raptors do (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998), although individuals from Eastern populations can aggregate in large numbers (e.g.&#160;Fehérvári <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;On migration, they form mixed flocks often over 100 strong with other falcons such as <em>F. naumanni</em>, and tend to stay at very high altitudes for the majority of the journey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The bulk of the population overwinters in the Kalahari region, but exact distributions may vary year to year depending on precipitation, which affects insect abundance (P. Palatitz <em>in litt. </em>2016). Before the northwards migration it may gather at stopover sites, and returns to the breeding grounds via West Africa and South and East Europe, creating a migration loop (P. Palatitz <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><p></p>","At the breeding grounds, the greatest threats are loss and degradation of foraging habitats and loss of nest sites (Palatitz <em>et al. </em>2009). Intensification of agriculture has resulted in conversion of natural habitats to agricultural fields and a decrease in extensive grassland management, especially grazing, reducing the availability of suitable foraging habitats (Palatitz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Widespread use of pesticides further affects food supply (Ferguson-Lees&#160;&amp; Christie&#160;2001). This species primarily uses rookeries for colonial nesting throughout their breeding range, therefore threats that affect Rooks (<em>Corvus frugilegus</em>) also affect Red-footed Falcons. The Rook population has declined in many areas due to logging of rookery trees, disturbance and persecution (Ferguson-Lees&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2001; Anon. 2007; Palatitz <em>et al. </em>2009; BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Even in areas where Rook populations are stable, some rooks have shifted to nesting in urban habitats (Palatitz <em>et al. </em>2009). This has forced the Red-footed Falcon to change its nest site selection habits, becoming heavily dependent on artificial nest boxes in some areas (Fehérvári&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008; Palatitz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008, 2015). As productivity is generally greater in larger colonies, further decreases may occur in the absence of conservation efforts (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001). The species appears to be hunted opportunistically during migration. In October 2007, 52 birds that had been roosting at Phasouri, Cyprus, were found shot (BirdLife International 2007,&#160;Palatitz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Illegal killing or harvest has also been reported in Ukraine (Yaremchenko&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009), Malta (Fenech 2010; N.

However, the topography of limestone outcrops may protect remaining forest from conversion to agriculture (Bianchi &amp; Haig 2012), so deforestation is likely to have slowed, with limestone mining and the construction of hydroelectric power plants likely to present the greatest threats into the future (T.

It leaves its breeding grounds in August and September, beginning their return in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds tend to migrate on broad fronts, but there are concentrations in Gibraltar and along the Rift Valley (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Nevertheless it will readily migrate over expanses of water (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Birds tend to hunt alone, although do gather at high prey concentrations and will roost in groups of often over 50, sometimes communally with <em>C. macrourus</em> and <em>C. aeruginosus </em>(Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).&#160; <strong>Habitat </strong>It is a bird of open country, usually in lowlands but occurring up to 1,500 m in central Asia, and on its African wintering grounds up to 4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Small birds and mammals form the majority of its diet; voles are a particularly dominant food source locally in abundant areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> It nests in tall vegetation on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>Tall vegetation must be left during the breeding season, with high rates of chick mortality when this is harvested on agricultural land; key management practices include moving nestlings to safe places during harvesting, and leaving areas unharvested around the vicinity of nests (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994).","In the past, the use of organochlorine pesticides seemed to cause a decline in Europe and probably to a lesser extent also in Africa (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).&#160;<br/><br/>Currently, the main threat in its breeding range is the conversion of its habitat to agricultural land, an environment in which crop gathering by combine harvesters causes frequent breeding failure in the species through nest destruction by farm machinery and increased risk of predation by native species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Berger-Geiger <em>et al. </em>2019). Intensification on this land increases this threat (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), as does the increasing tendency for earlier harvest dates (Berger-Geiger <em>et al. </em>2019). It is commensal with some forms of agriculture, and changes in these practices could leave it potentially vulnerable by depleting its supply of small birds and mammals to prey on (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012; Schaub <em>et al. </em>2020). Higher temperatures and aridity caused by climate change are predicted to reduce nesting success in some areas (Berger-Geiger <em>et al. </em>2019).

It is uncommon to scarce across its range. In general, the species is sedentary, with juveniles dispersing as far as 1000km in their first few years. Birds occupying the mostly northerly regions (&gt;65°N), such as Alaska, northern Canada, Fennoscandia and northern Russia, migrate south. In the Nearctic there are southwards movements to southern Alaska and southwest USA in September, via regular flyways, in particular through southwest Alberta. In the Palearctic, movements occur in a broad front to wintering areas in southeast Europe, the Russian steppes, Mongolia, northern China and Japan. Juveniles and immatures will go as far as North Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Habitat </strong>The species occupies a wide range of flat or mountainous, largely open habitats, often above the tree line, from sea level to 4000m. In the Himalayas it has been recorded as high as 6200m (Watson, 2010).<strong> Diet </strong>The species’s diet is very broad, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and carrion variously, depending on the regional prey availability. Prey taken are usually 0.5-4.0 kg and the species can hunt in pairs or small groups (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Breeding Site </strong>Nesting occurs on cliff ledges and where these are not available, in large trees or similar artificial structures. In central and southeastern Mongolia, birds regularly nest on the ground (Ellis 2020). Nests are constructed from sticks and are added to in successive years, growing to 2m in diameter. The breeding season spans March – August throughout the majority of its range, and in southern areas begins as early as November; whilst in the most northerly regions it will start as late as April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).</p>","The species was heavily persecuted in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, and although this threat has diminished significantly with populations now generally stable, the species is still deliberately poisoned, shot and trapped (for example in landscapes dominated by grouse moors in Scotland [RSPB 2017]). In the past the species was affected by the use of organochlorine pesticides although this is not a significant problem today. There are, however, recent reports of high exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in the USA (Niedringhaus <em>et al. </em>2021). The relationship between stock grazing and Golden Eagle populations is complex - both undergrazing as a result of grassland abandonment and overgrazing have been reported as threats by various European countries (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Electrocution from power lines has been reported as one of the primary causes of anthropogenic mortality in North America - Golden Eagles regularly perch on distribution poles supporting energised equipment (Dwyer <em>et al. </em>2020), and the USFWS (2016) estimated that 504 Golden Eagles are electrocuted annually. Wind energy developments are a source of direct mortality for the species, particularly in California where wandering sub-adults are mostly affected (Watson 2010).&#160; Future developments in flyways may affect migrating adult eagles, and locally may cause effective habitat loss and lead to collisions (Katzner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012b). In addition, afforestation, long term changes in food supply, including reduced livestock carrion through changing management practices, and climate change (for example drought [Smith <em>et al. </em>2020]) may threaten the species in future (Watson 2010).

Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds in September and October, wintering from France south as far as sub-Saharan Africa, and east as far as the Middle East (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). They begin their return journey in February and March, arriving in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migration is generally on a broad front, although there is some concentration at a few sites (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Hundreds of birds occasionally gather at roosting sites, sometimes with other harriers such as <em>C. pygargus</em>, but otherwise they are usually solitary, associating only temporarily at especially rich feeding sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They have a slightly greater tendency to be gregarious while on migration but the above still generally applies. Birds fly c. 10-30 m above the ground (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species inhabits extensive areas of dense marsh vegetation, in fresh or brackish water, generally in lowlands but up to 2,000 m in Asia and 3,000 m on its wintering grounds in Cameroon (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> It is a generalist predator taking a variety of prey types, with small birds generally preferred but mammals such as voles, rabbits and rats being more important in parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a pile of reeds built in dense marsh vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> The species requires extensive wetland in its breeding range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).</p>","<p>Main threats include wetland desiccation and drainage; persecution by shooting; pollution, especially from excessive pesticide use in and around wetlands (although widespread bans have reduced this threat somewhat), and poisoning by heavy metals, notably the consumption of lead-shot through feeding on contaminated waterbirds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species increasingly breeds and hunts in farmland, therefore loss of prey through agricultural intensification may pose an increasingly significant threat (Keller <em>et al. </em>2020). Molins-Delgado <em>et al. </em>(2017) found evidence for high levels of UV filters (used in sunscreens) in unhatched eggs of Western Marsh-harrier in Spain, which may have endocrine-disrupting effects. The historical threat of hunting in southern Europe has mostly subsided, but illegal shooting is still rife locally, notably on Malta (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).

Deforestation is degrading breeding habitats (Dravecký <em>et al</em>. 2015), and disturbance caused by forestry workers reduces breeding success (Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al.</em>. 2019). Studies on habitat use in Estonia suggest that changes in agricultural practices, particularly a reduction in grassland, and an increasing sown area of oilseed rape and maize may degrade foraging habitat around breeding areas (Vali <em>et al. </em>2017). Abandonment of breeding territories has been linked to depopulation of rural areas leading to a decline in stock grazing, resulting in afforestation of grassland and a decline in rodent prey (Demerdzhiev <em>et al. </em>2019)<em>.</em>&#160;It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012).

Lõhmus in litt. 1999).<em>&#160;</em>Deforestation in breeding areas poses a threat through loss of nesting sites - in an area in Russia where 40 pairs of Greater Spotted Eagles nested in 2012, half was cut down (I. Karyakin pers. comm. in Maciorowski <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Forestry operations are also a major cause of disturbance, as birds are intolerant of human presence in their territories (Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Drainage of wet woodland makes them more accessible to predators such as&#160;<em>Martes martes&#160;</em>(Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014)<em>.</em>Wintering habitats are also being lost - in Thailand, low intensity, rain-fed single crop rice are being replaced by multi-cropped intensive rice farms which are less suitable for foraging (P. D. Round <em>in litt.</em> 2016). <br/><br/>Shooting is a threat in Russia, the Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Africa (Brochet <em>et al. </em>2019; P. D. Round <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>1998, P. Mirski <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), together with deliberate and accidental poisoning across much of its range (Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;The poaching of eggs and hatchlings for collectors is also a serious threat&#160;(Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). On migration and at wintering grounds, electrocution, collision with wind turbines, shooting and poisoning&#160;are major causes of mortality (Perlman and Granit 2012;&#160;Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Lead poisoning from consuming waterbirds is a threat in some areas, for example at wintering grounds in Spain (Perez-Garcia&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).<p></p>","In Europe, the   breeding population is estimated to number 960-1,300 breeding pairs, equating   to 1,900-2,500 individuals (BirdLife International In prep.). Europe forms 25-49%   of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population   size is 3,900-10,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. There is very little data available on population sizes further east in the species's range. National population estimates include: c.100-10,000 breeding pairs,   c.50-1,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in   China; &lt; c.50 individuals on migration and &lt; c.50 wintering individuals   in Taiwan and c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on   migration in Russia (Brazil 2009). Estimates based on known breeding areas in the Volga-Ural region and southwest Siberia and the amount of suitable habitat suggest that the Russian population may be as large as 4,000-4,500 breeding pairs (Karyakin 2008, Karyakin <em>et al. </em>2012), however, given the vast size of the species's Russian range, further research is necessary to validate this.

Overall it is suspected to have undergone a very rapid decline of 63-89% over three generations owing to intentional and unintentional poisoning, habitat loss and conversion to agro-pastoral systems, declines in wild ungulate populations, hunting for trade and collisions. These declines are likely to continue into the future. For this reason it is listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","<em>Gyps africanus </em>is primarily a lowland species of open wooded savanna, particularly areas of <em>Acacia</em>. It requires tall trees for nesting, but has also been recorded nesting on electricity pylons in South Africa (de Swardt 2013). It is a gregarious species congregating at carcasses, in thermals and at roost sites. It nests in loose colonies. <p></p>","The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for trade, persecution and poisoning (see Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160; <br/><br/>In East Africa, the primary issue is poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide carbofuran), which occurs primarily   outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>species and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. rueppellii </span>puts them at significant risk, as this means they inevitably spend  considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010,   Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Kendall and  Virani 2012). Hunting with lead ammunition may also be incidentally contributing to species mortality (Naidoo <em>et al. </em>2017, Garbett <em>et al. </em>2018). Evidence from wing-tagging and telemetry  studies suggests that  annual mortality, primarily from incidental  poisoning, can be as high as  25% for the species&#160;(Kendall and Virani 2012). Cases across Africa suggest that the species may be subject to deliberate and accidental poisoning, respectively (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada<em> et al. </em>2016b): in the former case for belief-based use and to prevent birds from drawing attention to poaching activities. Mass poisoning events include at least 144 White-backed Vultures killed after feeding on an elephant carcass in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom <em>et al</em>. 2013); 76 died after feeding on 6 poisoned lion carcasses near Ruaha National Park, Tanzania in March 2018 (SSC<em>&#160;</em>2018); 468 died after feeding on 3 elephant carcasses in Botswana in June 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Modelling has shown that even one poisoned elephant carcass can have a dramatic impact on a population (Murn and Botha 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007), and the decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P. Hall&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2011). The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa, with an estimated 924-1,386 individuals traded over a six year period in West Africa, probably representing a significant proportion of the species's regional population (Buij&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). In South Africa, White-backed Vulture is one of the preferred vulture species in trade, according to a survey of traditional healers and traders (McKean&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). As a result of this and environmental pressures, it is predicted that the population in Zululand could become locally extinct in 26 years, unless harvest rates have been underestimated, in which case local extinction could be 10-11 years away (McKean and Botha 2007)<strong></strong>.&#160; There is also evidence that it is captured for international trade; for example in 2005, 13 individuals of this species being kept illegally in Italy were reportedly confiscated (F. Genero<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to&#160;<em>Gyps&#160;</em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. It was also reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2007)<strong></strong>&#160;and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. However, given that livestock carrion is not generally left out for scavenger consumption, this is likely to have less of an impact than it has in south-east Asia (C. Kendall&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/>Electrocution on powerlines is also a problem in parts of its range, and it is vulnerable to nest harvesting or disturbance by humans (Bamford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009); perhaps more so than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. rueppellii</span>, as it breeds in trees rather than on inaccessible cliffs (C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Additionally, the wild ungulate populations on which this species relies have declined precipitously throughout West and East Africa, even in protected areas (Western&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009, Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and, despite increased livestock numbers, improved animal husbandry and carcass disposal has reduced the number of livestock carcasses available (Mundy <em>et al. </em>1992). There is also a minor threat from road traffic, with individuals occasionally killed by vehicles (BirdLife Botswana 2008). Reported threats in the Athi-Kaputiei area in Kenya (an important breeding site for the species) include wind energy development, illegal logging of large trees (although Kendall <em>et al. </em>[2017] concluded that tree availability was not a limiting factor for vultures breeding in Masai Mara National Reserve), and natural gas exploration (Shema 2019).&#160;<p></p>","The species's global population was estimated at 270,000 individuals in 1992 (Mundy <em>et al. </em>1992), but it may now be more than an order of magnitude lower than this due to rapid population declines in recent years (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). The median estimate of the rate of decline, 4.1% annually (2.5-5.4%) (Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016a), is equivalent to a three generation reduction of 81% (63-89%).",Decreasing,"This species is the most widespread and common vulture in Africa, although it is now undergoing rapid declines. It occurs from <strong>Senegal, Gambia</strong> and <strong>Mali</strong> in the west, throughout the Sahel region to <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and <strong>Somalia</strong> in the east, through East Africa into <strong>Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia</strong> and <strong>South Africa</strong> in the south. Its global population has been estimated at 270,000 individuals. Consistent with other vulture species, it has declined by over 90% in West Africa (<strong></strong>J. M.

An ongoing study near Kimberley, South Africa, shows the number of breeding pairs has increased by 72% in 22 years (from 50 to 86 breeding pairs) (A. Anthony <em>in litt</em>. 2015). However McKean <em>et al</em>. (2013) suggest that if current levels of exploitation continue in South Africa, the species could become locally extinct by 2034 or sooner.&#160;Overall, it is suspected to have declined very rapidly throughout its global range.<p></p>","In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007), and the decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P.

A press release was also circulated in July 2007 to raise awareness of the impacts of hunting for medicinal and cultural reasons in southern Africa (McKean and Botha 2007), while&#160;BirdLife Botswana have launched a campaign to tackle illegal poisoning (Anon. 2013). At the 2014 Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species, a set of guidelines to address poisoning was formally adopted (Ogada <em>et al</em>. 2016a). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are  currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning  teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to respond  to a neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Since 2015, more than 1,500 rangers, veterinarians, police and other law enforcement and conservation staff have been trained in poisoning response and intervention in 10 countries, and initial results suggest that this can reduce vulture mortality by up to 30% (SSC<em>&#160;</em>2018).<br/><br/>The species is listed as nationally Critically Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan<em> </em>2015), and Endangered in Uganda and Namibia (Brown and Simmons 2015, WCS 2016).<br/><strong></strong><br/><br/><strong>Conservation&#160;</strong><strong>and Research&#160;</strong><strong>Actions Proposed<br/></strong>As part of the Multi-species Action Plan for African-Eurasian Vultures, over 120 key actions were put forward (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). Of these, 117 are considered relevant to African species. Full details for these can be found in Table 6 of Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017), but those actions considered 'Essential' by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) are presented here.<br/><br/>The two objectives with the most essential actions are to address knowledge gaps, and to reduce vulture unintentional mortality caused by the hunting of vertebrates. Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) say that the essential actions when trying to address knowledge gaps are to monitor the population sizes, distributions and trends; conduct a study to put a value on the ecosystem services and eco-tourism benefits vultures provide; and develop criteria for Vulture Safe Zones and implement these throughout the range states of the MsAP. To address the objective to reduce unintentional vulture mortality, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) suggest an overall analysis of poisoning's role in human-wildlife conflict, focusing on vultures; further awareness campaigns; training of staff to rapidly respond to poisoning incidents; and review and enforce penalties for wildlife poisoning, and if necessary introduce new penalties.<br/><br/>Further objectives also look into combating vulture mortality due to a range of factors. To combat the threat from NSAIDs, the essential actions proposed by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) are to prohibit the use of vulture-toxic NSAIDs in livestock and substitute them for vulture-friendly alternatives; and develop and implement a formal process to identify whether veterinary NSAIDs are toxic prior to them going on the market. For the threat from lead poisoning, the essential action proposed by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) is to implement CMS Resolution 11.15 as well as encouraging the voluntary uptake of lead ammunition bans in countries not part of CMS. In order to combat the threats from illegal trade and sentinel poisoning awareness and engagement programmes with stakeholders and training of rapid response units, respectively, have been proposed as essential actions (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017; Murn and Botha 2018). There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). The threats from infrastructure (collisions and electrocution) have similar essential actions, which are to conduct sensitivity mapping exercises to identify key regions; and promoting CMS guidelines to reduce mortality due to these threats (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>Finally, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) recommend as an essential action the establishment of a framework to effectively implement the MsAP, including both global and regional coordination units, which may be key to implementing not only these other essential actions, but as many of the other high and medium priority actions laid out in the action plan.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It feeds on carrion, both putrid and fresh. While feeding considerable aggregations can form, and regular communal roost sites are used. It is social and usually found in conspecific flocks. It breeds in colonies in tall trees (e.g. in Himanchal Pradesh it is restricted to pine forest/plantations [Thakur 2015, M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016]), often near human habitation. Movements are poorly known, although satellite-tagged birds have shown that they will forage over a vast range. The degree of connectivity of apparently separate populations is not known. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, as they were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in South Asia. <p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported&#160;(Prakash <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2007, Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume. Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause&#160;renal failure resulting in visceral gout in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a<strong></strong>, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Green <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;<strong></strong>Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014). Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in <em>Gyps</em> vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (<strong></strong>Green <em>et al</em>. 2004);&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality and diclofenac being banned in several range states, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008)<strong></strong>, potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam,&#160;an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan <em>et al. </em>2006a, Swarup <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160;Additionally, large vials of diclofenac continue to be manufactured for human use, which are then distributed, sold and used for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;A second veterinary drug in use in India and particularly in Bangladesh, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo <em>et al.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Nambirajan <em>et al. in prep.&#160;</em>2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla <em>et al. </em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). One study recorded that the sex of fledglings, the sex of dead adults and the sex of adults with visceral gout were all male-biased which may lead to problems in the future (Arshad&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>Other likely contributory factors in South Asia are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers) and poison and pesticide use, but these are probably of more minor significance (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;&#160;In Bangladesh, 61% of cattle owners surveyed said that they now buried dead cattle or used them as food in shrimp farms, which could lead to a reduction in food supply for vultures (Khan 2013). Forest fires may also be a threat in some areas, for instance in the Himalayas, though this may need further study (M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016). Deforestation, electrocution and collision with energy infrastructure may pose additional threats in some parts of the range (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of deceased livestock reducing food availability (Clements <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong>. In Cambodia, vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides to kill stray dogs and for hunting wildlife (Loveridge <em>et al. </em>2019; Clements <em>et al. </em>2013; S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Loveridge <em>et al </em>(2019) recorded 15 vulture poisoning events in Cambodia during 2005-2016, resulting in the known deaths of 32 White-rumped Vultures. The same study also recorded the first confirmed vulture mortality from carbofuran in Cambodia. Additional threats identified in Myanmar include direct persecution of the species through nest destruction, hunting and poisoning and indirectly through a loss of food supply (Hla <em>et al</em>. 2011).<p></p>","Formerly described as possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world, with a global population almost certainly numbering several million individuals, this species suffered dramatic population declines during the 1990s across its range. There are now an estimated c.6,000 individuals in India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2019), &lt;2,000 individuals in Nepal (DNPWC 2015), c.100 individuals in Cambodia (Sum and Loveridge 2016), c.260 individuals in Bangladesh (MoEF 2016) and 250-350 individuals in Bhutan and Pakistan (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The total population is therefore estimated to be c. 6,000-9,000 individuals, equating to 4,000-6,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps bengalensis</em> occurs in <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong>, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong> and southern<strong> Viet Nam, </strong>and may be extinct in<strong> </strong>southern<strong> </strong>China and Malaysia (BirdLife International 2001). It has been recorded from south-east Afghanistan and Iran where its status is currently unknown. As recently as 1985 the species was described as ""possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world"" (Houston 1985)<strong></strong>. However, it disappeared from most of South-East Asia in the early 20th century and the only viable populations in the region are found in Myanmar and Cambodia, mainly in the north (both probably in the low hundreds of individuals) (Hla 2003, Anon 2003, 2005, Eames 2007a,b, Hance 2009)<strong></strong>. Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in this part of its range is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005),&#160;as well as the impact of poisoning events as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practises (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Since the mid-1990s, it has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 99%) across the Indian Subcontinent (the majority of its historic range), first noticed&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">by villagers in northern India in 1996-97 (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016), with further early evidence from&#160;Keoladeo National Park, India, and then throughout India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003, 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, Pakistan (Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006),&#160;Nepal (Baral <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012) and Bangladesh (Khan 2013)<strong></strong>, to the point that the species is highly threatened with extinction. Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,<strong></strong> Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004<strong></strong><em></em>)<strong></strong>. This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, 2004b; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Declines in India between 2000 and 2007 averaged 43.9% per year (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>, and ranged between 11%-61% in Punjab province, Pakistan over the same period (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, while surveys of 23 known colonies in Punjab province in 2006 found a total of only 37 breeding pairs (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In the lowland districts of Nepal the species declined at 14% a year between 2002 and 2011 (Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). In Bangladesh, the species declined by 60% between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 (Khan 2013), and the population trend in the country is still a decline (IUCN-Bangladesh 2016).&#160;The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan banned veterinary diclofenac in 2006 and the Government of Bangladesh followed suit in 2010 (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). Since then, the rate of decline appears to have slowed, and may even have reversed in India and Nepal (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012). Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population (minimum 201 individuals in 2010; 183 individuals in 2011 [Clements <em>et al. </em>2013])<strong></strong>. Census results from Cambodia suggest the population there may have been increasing since 2004, or is at least stable (Eames 2007b, Clements <em>et al. </em>2013, S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), while there may be some local increases in India (D. L. Bohra <em>in litt. </em>2016). A local increase has also been noted in Pakistan, though this may be more a result of immigration (Murn <em>et al. </em>2014). Surveys of vulture restaurants in Myanmar in 2006 and 2007 estimated a minimum of 62 White-rumped Vultures were present (Hla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices I &amp; II, Raptors MOU Category 3. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the veterinary use of diclofenac, and Bangladesh followed suit in 2010. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008)<strong></strong>. The availability of diclofenac in veterinary drug stores in Bangladesh decreased from 100% in 2008-2009 to 53% in 2011-2012 (Khan 2013). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on <em>Gyps</em> vultures with no ill-effects (Swan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Swarup<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, such as ketoprofen (banned in&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Coimbatore, Erode and Nilgiris<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Districts [Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2016])&#160;(Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are currently multiple Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014, SAVE 2015). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as supporting wild birds (R. Cuthbert <em>in litt. </em>2016). They can also bring in vulture-related income for locals, through ecotourism (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are increasingly used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range, particularly Cambodia and Nepal, to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). The exchange of diclofenac with meloxicam near breeding colonies is taking place in Nepal in combination with diversionary feeding with diclofenac-free carcasses (Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce but not eliminate vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, simultaneously censusing nesting colonies, vulture deaths and looking for diclofenac use (Eames 2007a).&#160;Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., and to aid the development of suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that vultures provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres, each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts are on-going and met with success when two chicks hatched in early 2007 at a breeding centre in Pinjore, Haryana (V. Prakash <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Three more birds hatched in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive flocks that will ensure the full geographical spread of the species is represented in captive breeding efforts (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. By April 2008, there were 88 in captivity at three breeding centres in India, as well as 11 at a centre established by WWF-Pakistan and 14 in captivity in Nepal (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. During 2009, these numbers increased to 120 in India, 43 in Nepal and 14 in Pakistan (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. In late 2009, trials of artificial incubation methods were due to start soon (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. By November 2015, the total number held in breeding centres affiliated to SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) stood at 218 birds at 3 centres in India, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015), of which 20 juveniles had successfully fledged (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012); and as of 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles of all three resident&#160;<em>Gyps </em>species&#160;combined (V. Prakash <em>pers. comm. per. </em>C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Six captive-reared birds were released in Nepal in 2017, followed by the first 8 captive-bred individuals and a further 4 captive-reared birds in September 2018 (SAVE 2018). Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Wildlife Trust of India and the Assam Forest Department (Wildlife Trust of India 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). An updated action plan for vulture conservation in India was written in 2020 (MoEFCC 2020). Cambodia and Nepal have updated their 10-year (2016-2025)&#160;(Sum and Loveridge 2016)&#160;and 6-year (2014-2019) action plans (DNPWC 2015), and in 2016 an action plan was produced for Bangladesh. In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;<em>A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered&#160;</em>Gyps&#160;<em>vultures&#160;</em>that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to measure the frequency of diclofenac and ketoprofen-treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and support species management or restoration, as needed. Strengthen public awareness and public support programmes, including providing veterinary camps and livestock management training (SAVE 2014). Monitor remaining populations, in particular continue activities in Cambodia and Myanmar. Monitor the sale of veterinary drugs, and contamination of ungulate carcasses/dead vultures (SAVE 2014). Provide supplementary food sources, with appropriately-sized carcasses, where necessary for food-limited populations (see Hille <em>et al. </em>2016). Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres with the aim of holding at least 150 pairs of each species in captivity (<strong></strong>Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2008, Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008). Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012). Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac, and improve its availability (SAVE 2015). Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones.&#160;Four additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide, flunixin and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2016), and support bans for these vulture-toxic drugs. Attempt to fully implement a restriction in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2011, SAVE 2014). Promote Vulture Safe Zones, with expansion to include trans-boundary efforts as well as the opportunity for vulture-based ecotourism (SAVE 2014, 2015). Safeguard nesting areas from logging (SAVE 2014). Estimate the potential value of ecosystem services provided by vultures (SAVE 2014).</span>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The distribution of this species and existing efforts to reduce diclofenac use may limit the impacts.","This species inhabits mountainous areas, mostly at 1,200-5,500 m (X. Lu <em>in litt</em>. 2016), but has been recorded up to 6,000 m (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In winter it moves lower down, with juveniles wandering into the plains. It feeds on carrion (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1994) and regularly visits carcass dumps in South and South-East Asia (Praveen J. <em>in litt</em>. 2012, T. H. Galligan <em>in litt</em>. 2016, D. L. Yong <em>in litt</em>. 2016).","The most serious potential threat to this species is thought to be mortality caused through ingestion of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) widely used in livestock, particularly in South Asia. Diclofenac has caused drastic declines in three other <em>Gyps</em> species in South Asia since the early 1990s, owing to kidney failure following ingestion, with clinical signs of extensive visceral gout and renal failure, and the drug also appears to be fatal in <em>G. himalayensis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2010). Veterinary use of diclofenac is less common within the breeding range of <em>G. himalayensis </em>so adults are unlikely to be exposed, but juveniles may be when they migrate to lowland areas of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan (Das <em>et al. </em>2010; Bothat <em>et al. </em>2017). The decline noted in the Upper Mustang region of Nepal in 2002-2005 was thought highly likely to be caused by diclofenac poisoning <span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says"">(Acharya <em>et al</em>. 2009).

On the Qinghai-Tibet plateau the main threats appear to be chemical control for pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and the removal of livestock carcasses (X. Lu <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Thailand lack of natural food sources has been the sole reason for birds (20 juveniles) being admitted to the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit (C. Kasorndorkbua&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). In Pakistan, increased shrub cover due to a decline in winter grass cutting, promotion of stall feeding of livestock and decreasing nomadic pastoralism may be reducing the visibility of carcasses from the air, while reduced livestock numbers may be further limiting food availability (Siddique and Khan 2016). Electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure is likely to be a threat across much of the range, however there is currently little documented evidence (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017; MaMing and Xu 2015). There is anecdotal evidence of Himalayan Griffons being caught and kept as pets (Sum and Loveridge 2016).

204672586,22729731,Gyps indicus,Critically Endangered,A2abce+4abce,2021,2021-07-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,This species is classified as Critically Endangered because it has suffered an extremely rapid population decline as a result of mortality from feeding on carcasses of animals treated with the veterinary drug diclofenac.  <p></p> <p></p>,"It is found in cities, towns and villages near cultivated areas, and in open and wooded areas. This species feeds almost entirely on carrion, and often associates with White-rumped Vulture <em>G. bengalensis</em> when scavenging at carcass dumps and slaughterhouses. It nests almost exclusively in colonies on cliffs and ruins, although in one area, where cliffs are absent, it has been reported nesting in trees. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, and were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India, which in turn reduces the amount of food available for potentially problematic species, such as feral dogs (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2012b).<p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Pakistan and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported (Prakash&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, 2007, Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality, with renal failure resulting in visceral gout found in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that have been treated with the drugs prior to death and left for scavengers to consume (as is tradition in Hindu cultures). Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs that then cause renal failure and death. Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in the species just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues <strong></strong>(Green <em>et al</em>. 2004),&#160;and sampling livestock carcasses in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations<strong> </strong>(Paudel 2008), potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam, an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006a, Swarup&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Recent bans of diclofenac in the region still have not eradicated its use in veterinary treatments, as it is still found in the carcasses of livestock and vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014, 2015). This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015). A second veterinary drug in use in India, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Nambirajan&#160;<em>et al. in prep.&#160;</em>2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Other possible contributory factors are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers), unintentional poisoning from consumption of poisoned baits intended for feral dogs or wild carnivores, electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure, disturbance from rock climbers at cliff nesting sites (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), drought (Hall <em>et al. </em>2012) and mining activity (Chhangani 2004).","Prakash <em>et al. </em>(2019) estimated the population to be c.12,000 individuals based on road transects carried out in 2015. This roughly equates to 8,000 mature individuals. It is placed in the band 5,000-15,000 mature individuals.&#160;<p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps indicus</em> breeds in south-east <strong>Pakistan</strong> and peninsular <strong>India</strong> south of the Gangetic plain, north to Delhi, east through Madhya Pradesh, south to the Nilgiris, and occasionally further south (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species was first recorded in Nepal in 2011 (Subedi and DeCandido 2013). It was common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 97%) throughout its range. This was first noticed in Keoladeo National Park, India <strong></strong>(Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003), where counts of feeding birds fell from 816 birds in 1985-1986 to just 25 in 1998-1999. Only tiny populations in the Ramanagaram Hills of Karnataka and Nilgiri Forest Division in Tamil Nadu are known to remain in inland southern India, and it is rare elsewhere within its former range (Prakash <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2015, 2016). A&#160;new breeding colony appears to have developed near the India-Pakistan border in the Bikaner District, India (Chaudhry&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).<p></p>",Small numbers are kept in captivity for display.,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices 1 &amp; 2, Raptors MOU Category 1. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. In 2006 the Indian government passed a bill banning the manufacture and importation of diclofenac as a veterinary drug, and in 2008 further legislation was passed banning the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of veterinary diclofenac.&#160;Similar laws are now in place in Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India in 2008 warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use'<strong> </strong>(BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008)<strong></strong>. However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on&#160;<em>Gyps</em>&#160;vultures with no ill-effects (Swan&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Swarup<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al.</span>&#160;2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres each capable of holding 25 pairs<strong> </strong>(Bombay Natural History Society 2004) - ultimately at least 150 pairs of the three species should be held in captivity to ensure sufficient birds are available to re-establish wild colonies in the future <strong></strong>(<strong></strong>Lindsay 2008). Captive breeding efforts are ongoing - by 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles per year of all three resident&#160;<em>Gyps&#160;</em>vultures combined (V. Prakash&#160;<em>pers. comm.;</em>&#160;Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), and there are currently over 600 individuals in captivity at three captive breeding centres in India<strong> </strong>(SAVE 2021)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focused on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs (Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Conservation activities include: meeting key groups (e.g. pharmacists, veterinarians and livestock owners); engaging government officials (e.g. drug control, livestock services and forest departments) at tehsil, district and state levels; engaging with the public (e.g. festival programmes, media coverage and signage); diclofenac-free district declaration; community-run formal or informal Vulture Safe Feeding Sites (i.e., vulture [Jatayu] restaurants); vulture-related income generation for villages at nesting or feeding sites; diclofenac-meloxicam exchanges; husbandry and veterinary training camps; and national and international ecotourism to feeding sites and conservation breeding sites (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;There are currently 12 provisional Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce (but not eliminate) vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps</em><em> </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008). Satellite tagging has been employed on Asian <em>Gyps </em>vultures&#160;to improve understanding of their movements and range use so as to aid the development of conservation strategies for the genus (Ellis 2004).<br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). An updated 5-year (2020-2025) action plan has been produced for vulture conservation in India (MoEFCC 2020), and a 4-year (2015-2019) action plan was was written for Nepal but has not been updated (DNPWC 2015).&#160;In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;<em>A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered&#160;</em>Gyps&#160;<em>vultures&#160;</em>that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Identify the location and number of remaining individuals. Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and attempt to implement a ban on other vulture-toxic NSAIDs.&#160;Support species management or restoration, as needed. Monitor remaining populations. Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres. Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac. Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones. Three drugs, aceclofenac, ketoprofen and nimesulide, are thought to be toxic to vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2015), and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013). Fully implement restrictions in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011). Attempt to estimate the potential value, in terms of ecosystem services, provided by wild vultures. Protect nesting areas. Maintain and promote Vulture Safe Zones, including trans-boundary efforts. Within VSZs, promote livestock management training and provide free veterinary camps.These and multiple other Conservation Actions were proposed as part of SAVE (2014) and SAVE (2015) for all Asian vultures. A comprehensive list of conservation actions proposed can be found in Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017).&#160;<p></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Overall it  is suspected to have undergone a very rapid decline owing to habitat  loss and conversion to agro-pastoral systems, declines in wild ungulate  populations, hunting for trade, persecution, electrocution and collision with powerlines and poisoning.<br/><p></p>","It frequents open areas of <em>Acacia</em> woodland, grassland and montane regions, and it is gregarious, congregating at carrion, soaring together in flocks and breeding mainly in colonies on cliff faces and escarpments at a broad range of elevations. In Kenya, the number of nests at a colony may be inversely related to rainfall in the previous year, and timing of nesting varies from year to year (Virani <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;It locates food entirely by sight.<p></p>","The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being  susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild  ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for  trade, persecution and poisoning (Ogada <em>et al</em>. 2016).  In East Africa, the primary issue is  poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide  carbofuran), which occurs primarily   outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. africanus</span> puts them both at significant risk as it means they inevitably spend  considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010,   Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Kendall and  Virani 2012). In  addition, the ungulate wildlife  populations on which this species relies have  declined precipitously throughout East  Africa, even in protected areas  (Western <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/>In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2007)<strong></strong>. In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong> and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2007)<strong></strong>. The West African population has been heavily exploited for trade, with birds commonly sold in fetish markets (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Nikolaus 2006, Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015)<strong></strong>. It is one of the most commonly traded vultures in West and Central African markets, with numbers traded (1,128-1,692 individuals over a six year period in West Africa) probably representing a significant proportion of the regional population (Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015), with vultures being used in traditional medicine (W. Goodwin <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Dogon of central Mali climb the Hombori cliffs to take eggs and chicks of this species (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>. The decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria appears to be entirely  attributable to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju  practices (P. Hall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011). It is apparently also captured for international trade. In 2005, 30 birds were reportedly confiscated by the Italian authorities (F. Genero <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Disturbance, especially from climbers, is a particular problem for this species. In Mali, the Hombori and Dyounde massifs are dotted with at least 47 climbing routes, on which expeditions take place every year, mainly during the species's breeding season. However, the impact of these activities is not known (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>. Climate change may be causing a shift in suitable habitat, which may explain the increased sightings in Northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula (Garrido <em>et al. </em>2020). Electrocution and collision with power lines may pose a significant threat (Ogada <em>et al. </em>2016; Garrido <em>et al. </em>2020).&#160;<br/><p></p>","<p>Mundy <em>et al</em>. (1992) estimated a population perhaps of the order of 11,000 pairs, comprising 3,000 pairs in Tanzania, 2,000 in Kenya where ‘up to thousands’ concentrated at favoured sites, 2,000 in Ethiopia where it was said to be ‘common to locally abundant’, 2,000 in Sudan where was the ‘most common vulture in the North’, and 2,000 for West Africa. This could indicate a population of 22,000 mature individuals and perhaps c.30,000 individuals at the start of the 1990s. Subsequent extremely rapid population declines mean that the population is now likely to be much lower.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occurs throughout the Sahel region of Africa from <strong>Senegal, Gambia </strong>and<strong> Mali </strong> in the west to <strong>Sudan, South Sudan </strong>and <strong>Ethiopia </strong>in the east.

Formerly abundant, the species has experienced extremely rapid declines in much of its range, particularly West Africa. Although in Gambia it is apparently stable (C.

In South-East Asia it was found in open and partly wooded country, generally in the lowlands. This species feeds almost entirely on carrion, scavenging at carcass dumps and slaughterhouses, and at carcasses dumped in the fields and along rivers. It has only been recorded nesting in trees, usually large ones, usually at a height of 7-25 m, sometimes near villages but usually more remote. It is a solitary nester. While feeding, considerable mixed species aggregations can form (where it can be one of the more regularly aggressive vulture species [Hille <em>et al. </em>2016]), and regular communal roost sites are used. It is social and usually found in conspecific flocks, interacting with other vultures at carcasses. Movements are poorly known, and the degree of connectivity of apparently separate populations is not known. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services. They were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India.<br/><p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported. The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality. Vultures are exposed to diclofenac (and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs [NSAIDs]) through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume (as is tradition in Hindu cultures).&#160;Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs that therefore cause renal failure and death&#160;(<strong></strong>Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, <strong></strong>Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, <strong></strong>Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006).<strong></strong>&#160;Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in <em>Gyps</em> vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004)&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Anon 2009)<strong></strong>, potentially leading to a slower uptake of a vulture safe alternative drug (meloxicam). Also, despite bans and the wide availability of meloxicam, diclofenac is still widely found in carcasses and vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014, 2016).&#160;This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015).&#160;Other veterinary drugs (ketoprofen, flunixin, nimesulide, aceclofenac and fenbendazole) have also recently been identified to be potentially lethal to vulture&#160;species (Naidoo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009,&#160;Zorrilla <em>et al.</em> 2015, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2016, Galligan <em>et al. </em>2016, Sharma 2016).<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably results from the collapse of large wild mammal populations due to overhunting and improved management of deceased livestock leading to scarcity of available food (Clements<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013), but persecution and poisoning is also thought to be a problem. In Cambodia vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides (S. Mahood&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012; Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Other potential contributory factors to declines in this species are direct persecution, pesticide use and electrocution/ collision with energy infrastructure (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017) but these are probably of minor significance.","Considerable confusion over the taxonomy and identification of <em>Gyps</em> vultures has occurred, making it difficult to be sure of the population size. In 2015, the population was estimated to be c.1,000 individuals in India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2019; MoEFCC 2020), 47 individuals in Cambodia (Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016), fewer than 50 individuals in Nepal (DNPWC 2015), and a single breeding pair in Bangladesh (MoEF 2016). Very little is known about the size of the population in Myanmar, however counts made at vulture restaurants during 2003-2006 suggest a population of c.21 individuals (Hla&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010). The total population is therefore thought to be c.1,100-1,300 individuals, roughly equating to 730-870 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps tenuirostris</em> is found in <strong>India</strong> north of, and including, the Gangetic plain, west to at least Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, south to southern West Bengal (and possibly northern Orissa), east through the plains of Assam, and through southern <strong>Nepal</strong>, and north and central <strong>Bangladesh</strong>. It formerly occurred more widely in South-East Asia, but it is now thought to be extinct in Thailand and Malaysia, and the only recent records are from <strong>Cambodia</strong>, southern <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Myanmar</strong>. Considerable confusion over the taxonomy and identification of <em>Gyps </em>vultures has occurred, making it difficult to be sure of claims for this species. However, it appears to be allopatric or parapatric with Indian Vulture <em>G. indicus</em> where their ranges abut (or potentially do so) in northern India. <br/><br/>It was once common, but in South-East Asia populations declined through the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, and are now probably very small and restricted in distribution and limited mainly to Cambodia (where the first nests recorded in the country were recently found and surveys in 2015 recorded a total of 47 individuals at vulture 'restaurants' [Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016]) and Myanmar (counts made at vulture restaurants suggest a population of c.21 individuals [Hla <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010]). Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in the region is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005). <br/><br/>In India and Nepal, the species was common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s it has suffered a catastrophic decline of up to 96.8%, with a combined average decline in India of this species and <em>G. indicus</em> of over 16% annually between 2000 and 2007 (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In Nepal the species was formerly fairly common and widespread, but during 2002-2011 it declined by 18.7% per year (Chaudhary&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), although there may have since been a partial recovery (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;It is now extremely rare in the east of Nepal and local and uncommon in the centre and west (Inskipp <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, <strong></strong>Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004,<strong></strong> Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005).<strong></strong> This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses, leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,b<strong></strong>; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Probably owing to the effects of diclofenac, breeding success in parts of its Indian range is reportedly low; of 14 nests found in Assam just four had chicks (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population. Likewise, surveys conducted in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007 found no firm evidence of diclofenac use (Eames 2007).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices I &amp; II, Raptors MOU Category 1. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the veterinary use of diclofenac, and Bangladesh followed suit in 2010. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India in 2008 warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, which is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert et al. 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on Gyps vultures with no ill-effects (Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert et al. 2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs (Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). Conservation activities include: meeting key groups (e.g. pharmacists, veterinarians and livestock owners); engaging government officials (e.g. drug control, livestock services and forest departments) at tehsil, district and state levels; engaging with the public (e.g. festival programmes, media coverage and signage); diclofenac-free district declaration; community-run formal or informal Vulture Safe Feeding Sites (i.e., vulture [Jatayu] restaurants); vulture-related income generation for villages at nesting or feeding sites; diclofenac-meloxicam exchanges; husbandry and veterinary training camps; and national and international ecotourism to feeding sites and conservation breeding sites (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). There are currently 12 provisional Vulture Safe Zones being established in countries including India, Nepal and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research - in Cambodia these are run by The Cambodia Vulture Conservation Project and a partnership between national and international conservation NGOs (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, H. Rainey <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., in order to develop suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that they provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts began in 2006 when 18 Slender-billed Vultures were captured for the captive-breeding facility in Pinjore, India. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. In April 2008, there were 28 birds at the three Indian breeding centres (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, increasing to 35 birds in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Two individuals bred in captivity for the first time in 2009. By November 2015, the total number in breeding centres in India was 218, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015).&#160;The Central Zoo Authority of India has also set up several Vulture Consevration Breeding centres (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<em>&#160;</em>A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive breeding efforts that represent the full geographical spread of the species (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Wildlife Trust of India and the Assam Forest Department (Wildlife Trust of India 2019).&#160;Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, accompanied by searches for nesting colonies, research into vulture deaths and investigation of possible diclofenac use in livestock (Eames 2007). <br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha et al. 2017). An updated 5-year (2020-2025) action plan has been produced for vulture conservation in India (MoEFCC 2020), a 9-year (2016-2025) action plan for Cambodia (Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016) and Bangladesh (MoEF 2016), and a 4-year (2015-2019) action plan was was written for Nepal but has not been updated (DNPWC 2015). In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered Gyps vultures that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Multiple Conservation Actions were proposed as part of SAVE (2014) and SAVE (2015). Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac (as well as the removal of human-use diclofenac in vials of &gt;3 ml), and attempt to implement a ban on other vulture-toxic NSAIDs. Regulate the production of veterinary drugs to identify vulture-safe NSAIDs. Support species management or restoration, as needed. Initiate public awareness and public support programmes. Identify the location and number of remaining individuals and identify actions required to prevent extinction. Monitor remaining populations, in particular replicate conservation and research activities in Myanmar that have been implemented in Cambodia. Provide supplementary food sources where necessary for food-limited populations in South-East Asia, and maintain and promote Vulture Safe Zones, including trans-boundary efforts. Within VSZs, promote livestock management training and provide free veterinary camps. Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres, and identify the most appropriate sites for release of captive-bred individuals.

It is suspected that it will decline at a rate of 20-30% over three generations in the future as significant threats are ongoing, and some (such as climate change) are predicted to worsen. It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable.   <p></p>","It breeds on sea coasts and inland near larger rivers (mostly on lower stretches) or lakes, where there are stands of mature trees. In the Magadan district of Russia, successful breeding pairs along coasts appear to produce more fledged chicks than successful pairs on rivers, and average brood size is larger for coastal pairs (Potapov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, 2012). Annual net chick production showed an increase in constantly monitored coastal sites, but a decrease in river sites (Potapov <em>et al.</em> 2012). &#160;During the autumn birds forage along rivers where dead salmon are abundant. During mid-winter, birds in Russia tend to remain on the coast, except some that winter in Kamchatka along inland rivers fed by hot springs and at Lake Kurilskoye (M.

Industrial pollution of rivers and high levels of DDT/DDE, PCBs and heavy metals are further threats (Iwata <em>et al. </em>2000; Kim <em>et al. </em>1999). Over-fishing has caused a decline of fish stocks in Russia and Japan which has led to an increasing tendency of birds on Hokkaido to move inland and scavenge on sika deer carcasses left by hunters, exposing them to a risk of lead poisoning through ingestion of lead shot (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001). Despite laws being introduced in Japan in 2004 prohibiting the use of lead ammunition for hunting large animals, and further laws in 2014 prohibiting possession of lead ammunition, lead poisoning continues to be a significant threat (Ishii <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160; On Sakhalin Island, the most significant threat to breeding success is nestling predation by brown bears, while other threats include adverse weather (which may form ecological traps on migration routes), food shortages due to overfishing, habitat alteration, disturbance at nest sites, and infection by the blood parasite haemosporida (Romanov and&#160;Masterov 2020). Shooting may also be a local threat in parts of the wintering range (GRIN 2021). Declines in reproductive output along the coastline and rivers of the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk are predominantly caused by&#160;increasing frequency and intensity of spring floods, which impede successful hunting and therefore reduce breeding output, and reduced ice cover in spring (Potapov&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;<p></p>","M.

However, Masterov and&#160;Romanov (2014) estimate the global population to be 6,000-7,000, which roughly equates to 4,000-4,670 mature individuals.

Relatively few individuals are believed to have entered Morocco, indicating that powerlines may represent a serious threat to the potential re-establishment of a breeding population in the country. Despite the general success of mitigation measures applied in&#160;Andalucía (<span class=""msoIns"">Lopez-Lopez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em><span class=""msoIns"">2011), eleven individuals have been found electrocuted since 2010 (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Several individuals have been found shot in the past decade in both Spain and Portugal (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2016,&#160;J. R. Garrido <em>in litt.</em> 2016), suggesting that hunting remains a threat to the species. Additionally, the ingestion of lead shot embedded in the flesh of prey items may be a problem in certain areas&#160;(González and Oria 2004, <span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns"">Pain&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). The threats from poisoning and shooting highlight the importance of maintaining co-operation with landowners throughout the breeding range. In Spain, rab<span lang=""EN-US"">bit populations declined by 55% between 1973 and 2002 (Virgós <em>et al.</em> 2007). The incidence of viral haemorrhagic diseases and changes in the management of hunting estates has reduced prey availability. (Cabezas-Díaz <em>et al. </em>2011). <span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span lang=""EN-US"">The intensification of farming through irrigation in parts of the range, coupled with increasing urban development, has reduced the availability and suitability of habitat in these areas and may constrain future population growth, with an increase in incidents of human conflict noted in these areas (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016). The development of large areas of land for the production of renewable energy so far does not appear to have had negative impacts, however one individual was found dead in Andalucía in 2012 (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt.</em> 2016), and this threat may be increasing as more wind farms are being installed in many parts of the species's range (S Cabezas-Díaz <em>in litt. </em>2020). Human activities in the vicinity of active nests can disturb incubating adults and reduce hatching success (González&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006,&#160;<strong></strong>Margalida&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). The limitation of funds for adequate monitoring and implementation of mitigation actions (particularly around the safety of powerlines for birds) may be a significant constraint in the future (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>i</em><em>n litt</em>. 2016).<strong style=""""></strong><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The species's global population is estimated at 530-540 breeding pairs, equating to 1,060-1,080 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>), which is assumed to be indicative of a total population of c.1,600 individuals.",Increasing,"An Iberian breeding endemic eagle, most of the population breeds in <strong>Spain</strong> with a small but increasing population in <strong>Portugal</strong>. In Spain, breeding occurs in the&#160;Sierras of Guadarrama and Gredos, the plains of the Tajo, Tiétar, Guadiana and Duero rivers, the central hills of Extremadura, Montes de Toledo, the Alcudia valley, Sierra Morena, Campo de Montiel, the Guadalquivir marshes, the agricultural lands of&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Cádiz and in Salamanca, Valladolid, Zamora and Burgos (González 1996; S.

Garrido <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>The species recovered from a low of only 30 pairs in the 1960s to 38 pairs in 1970, and to around 200 pairs by 2004 (González and Oria 2004), despite a brief dip in the mid-1990s attributed to a viral haemorrhagic disease reducing rabbit populations (J. Criado<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>1999). The population has subsequently increased considerably, although it now appears to have reached a plateau (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). By 2020, the global population had increased to 530-540 pairs (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Portugal&#160;was recolonised in 2003 after an absence of breeding activity for over 20 years, and numbers have been slowly increasing since, with 16 breeding territories located in 2016 and 17 breeding pairs in 2019 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2013; S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Interchange of individuals has been noted between the populations in Portugal and in&#160;Andalucía. There is considerable variation in the rate of population increase throughout the range: In Extremadura, the increase was only c. 2% between 1990 and 2015 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016), while in&#160;Andalucía&#160;the population has more than doubled since 2008 to 111 pairs (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016). Improved adult survival appears to have driven the population increase and the observed temporal and spatial variation in population growth rates (Ferrer &amp; Calderon 1990; Ortega <em>et al. </em>2009). More recently, reduced adult survival appears to have caused a plateau in population size (<span lang=""EN-US"">S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Initial positive trends were associated with conservation measures, which reduced the mortality associated with powerlines and poisoning events, but also benefited the population through supplementary feeding, reparation of nests, reintroductions and reduction of disturbance during the breeding period (González&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2007,&#160;<span lang=""ES"">López-López <em>et al. </em>2011,&#160;J.

However, recently mortality caused by powerlines, shooting and collision with wind turbines has increased, and poisoning remains a threat (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In Andalucía, a reintroduced population has been established in Cádiz, with four to five breeding pairs producing offspring, which have subsquently bred at several sites in southern Spain and in Portugal (Muriel <em>et al. </em>2011, J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016). As a result of the improving fortunes of the species in Iberia, an increasing number of dispersing immature birds are being recorded in <strong>Morocco</strong>, where the species became extinct as a breeding species in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century (Thevenot&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003, Maghreb Ornitho 2017).

Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Around 60% of the total breeding population is now located in protected areas (national and EU Special Protected Areas), down from c. 70% in 2011 (Barov and Derhé 2011), which may reflect the growth of the population into new areas. Dispersal and critical areas for the species have not been updated for several years, therefore many are not legally delimited or protected against damaging activities (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Since 1987, national and regional governments have been implementing a coordinated conservation plan for the species. A European action plan was published in 1996 and updated in 2008 (Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2008). The national plan for Spain was implemented in 2018, while in <span lang=""EN-US"">Portugal a plan is being prepared&#160;(S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). <span lang=""EN-US"">Between 1991-1999, more than 14,000 dangerous electric pylons were modified in Spain, considerably reducing deaths from electrocution (González and Margalida 2008,&#160;López-López&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). As a result, a national law was approved in Spain in 2008, establishing tools for the protection of birds against collision and electrocution in power lines and best practice for new power line construction or modification (Guil <em>et al. </em>2011). &#160;Work has also been carried out to isolate dangerous power lines on private farms (Cabezas-Díaz 2011). In Portugal, the main potentially dangerous electric pylons have been identified in the core areas of the species and a modification plan has been established. Around 40 km of powerlines were modified between 2009 and 2011; however, around 80 km still require funding (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Isolation of power lines has been demonstrated to be obsolete in many cases (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160; <em>in lill. </em>2020). A supplementary feeding programme has been established to mitigate the effects of rabbit decreases, and has significantly increased breeding success (González and Margalida 2008). Nest monitoring has reduced disturbance and improved reproductive success (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">The <em>Soaring&#160;</em>land stewardship network, which was created by SEO/BirdLife and the preceding Flying High Programme, for the conservation of Spanish Imperial Eagle lasted from 2006 to 2015 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016)<span lang=""EN-US"">. This network involved 112 municipalities, 22,000 ha of private land and 96 schools, and focused on habitat management, species conservation, awareness raising and information activities across the whole distribution range in Spain (Cabezas-Díaz and Hernáez 2012). In Castilla-La Mancha, an EU LIFE-funded projected, ""Conservación de especies prioritarias en el monte mediterráneo en Castilla-La Mancha""&#160;is working for the conservation of this and&#160;other species related to Mediterranean forests, while a counterpart project, LIFE Imperial, is focused on the conservation of the species in Portugal (R. Alcazar <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Andalucía, a conservation programme was implemented, which includes hacking techniques for the reintroduction of the species, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">among other conservation actions (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Work is ongoing to raise awareness and support on private land where the species breeds, including improving habitat management (García 2007), and nearly 50% of breeding pairs are covered by such projects (González and Margalida 2008). In Cádiz, 73 young birds have been released as part of a reintroduction project (Ferrer 2011 <em>unpubl</em>.), and currently five breeding pairs have become established in the province providing a new population nucleus (Muriel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).

It forages in lowland and montane regions over open, often arid, country, and also scavenges at human settlements. It has a broad diet including carrion, tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and even faeces (Margalida <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dobrev <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016).

Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain (Hernandez and Margalida 2009, Sanz-Aguillar <em>et al. </em>2015b) and the Balkans (I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2016). Declines in parts of Africa are likely to have been driven by loss of  wild ungulate populations and, in some areas, overgrazing by livestock and improvements in slaughterhouse sanitation<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2016). The population crash in the Cape Verde Islands has been attributed to a rise in mortality due to the former use of long-lasting pesticides (some of which, although now illegal, are still easily bought and used), the ongoing poisoning of stray dogs, and a decrease in food availability due to urbanisation, rural abandonment and better sanitation (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2020).<em>&#160;</em>Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional ""<em>muladares</em>"" in Spain and Portugal<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Donázar 2004, J.

Similarly, closures of over 300 small rubbish dumps in Oman as part of an upgrade in waste management may reduce food availability (S. Al Touqi, cited in McGrady <em>et al. </em>2018), although a study in Turkey found no short-term effect on reproductive success of closure of rubbish dumps (Katzenberger <em>et al. </em>2017). In parts of the range where transhumance occurs, there may be asymmetries in food availability at different times of year (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2018). However, recently passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers and guidelines about how to operate them exist&#160;(A. Brunner<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al.</em> 2010), and in eastern Europe dietary diversity has no effect on population sizes, but instead could affect territory size (Dobrev&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Poisoning is a significant threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2009, Cortés-Avizanda <a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623""><em>et al</em>. 2009, 2015 Sanz-Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2015b, Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2016</a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a>), and through the consumption of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries including Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted potential contamination of Egyptian Vultures that may lead to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease&#160;(e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria<strong><sup> </sup></strong>[Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008]).&#160;<br/><br/>It appears that diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International 2008), is driving the recent rapid declines in India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, A.

NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by <em>Gyps</em> spp. vultures<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006). In 2007, diclofenac was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). This drug has recently been approved for veterinary use in Europe, and is commercially available in France and Spain, which is a major concern for the species (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2007a) and &#160;potentially risky in other regions of Spain (<a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623"">Donázar and Benítez <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span></a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a> 2007, Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and in Africa (Nikolaus 1984, 2006), with 17 individuals found killed by electrocution in Port Sudan, over 10 days in&#160; 2010 (I.

In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W. Goodwin <em>in litt. </em>2016). Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture (<em>Gyps fulvus</em>) may reduce breeding success<strong><sup> </sup></strong>in the short-term (Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008). <span style=""font-style: italic;""><p></p></span>","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number&#160;3,000-4,500 breeding pairs, equating to&#160;6,100-9,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms 25-49% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 12,400-36,000 mature individuals, roughly equating to 18,600-54,000 individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occupies a large range with isolated resident populations in the<strong> </strong>Cabo Verde and Canary Islands in the west (although they may still have some connectivity to the continental population&#160;[Agudo <em>et al. </em>2011]), through <strong>Morocco</strong>&#160;(Amezian and Khamlichi 2015) and parts of West Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie&#160; 2001). A small resident population persists in <strong>Angola</strong> and <strong>Namibia</strong>. The bulk of the resident population occurs in <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and East Africa, Arabia and the Indian Subcontinent, while Saharan and Sahelian parts of Africa in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Algeria</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Niger,</span> northernmost <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cameroon, Chad</span> and northern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sudan</span> also hold significant but presumably smaller populations (I.

These birds winter within the resident range, and in addition throughout the Sahel region of Africa. Global population estimates for the species are crude, but 3,000-4,500 pairs are estimated in Europe (BirdLife International <em>in prep</em>), &lt; 2,000 pairs in central Asia, just a few thousand pairs now in the Indian Subcontinent,  perhaps 1,000 pairs in the Middle East, and perhaps 1,000-2,000 pairs in Africa (Thiollay 1989, I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).&#160;The population size in Europe is estimated to have decreased by 50-79% in 53.4 years (three generations) (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;In Spain, which with c.1,300 pairs may support as much as 40% of the European breeding population, the number of territories declined by at least 25% between 1987-2000 (i.e. equating to a decline of &gt;50% over three generations)<sup><strong> </strong></sup>(Donázar 2004, Del Moral 2009), likely due to high mortality rates (Cortés-Avizanda <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The Spanish population was estimated to be stable for the period 1998-2011 (BirdLife International 2015, Tauler <em>et al. </em>2015), and the adjacent French population appears to be increasing (Lieury <em>et al.</em> 2015), although 2015 appeared to be a bad year there (Vulture Conservation Foundation 2016). Balkan populations are however still declining at 4-8% per year, with the population in <strong>Greece</strong>&#160;having declined by 44-60% over 30 years&#160;(Xirouchakis and Tsiakiris 2009, Grubač&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Velevski <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declines are reported from the Middle East<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(S.

Around 1,900 birds are resident in a stable population on the island of Socotra (Porter and Suleiman 2012). The resident populations within Africa have declined by 5.9% per year over the past 29-36 years &#160;(Ogada <em>et al.</em> 2016), including those in Ethiopia and <strong>Djibouti<sup> </sup></strong>(G. Mulholland <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Arkumarev&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014), Kenya (Virani <em>et al. </em>2011),&#160;and Angola and Namibia (where just 10 pairs remain)<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(R.

The veterinary drug diclofenac has now been banned by the Indian government. In 2007, a survey began to establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). &#160;Due to the recent legalisation of diclofenac for veterinary use in the EU, there is an active campaign against the use of diclofenac in the European Union (http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia/project/ban-veterinary-diclofenac). An International species action plan for the species was published in 2008 (Iñigo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). National species action plans are in place in France, Bulgaria and Italy, and the species is included in the Balkan Vulture Action Plan (BVAP). Efforts are being taken to release captive-bred individuals in parts of Italy. In Spain, France, Italy, Bulgaria and Macedonia birds have been fitted with satellite-tags to study juvenile dispersion, migratory movements and wintering areas (e.g. García-Ripollés <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010,&#160;López-López&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2015). Nest guarding schemes for pairs that are most threatened by poachers have been implemented in Italy and Bulgaria, where very small populations survive (Zuberogoitia<em> et al.</em> 2014, Oppel<em> et al. </em>2016). Expeditions to study the limiting factors in the wintering areas and along the migration flyway have taken place together with local organizations in Mauritania, Senegal, Ethiopia, Sudan and Turkey (Arkumarev <em>et al.</em> 2014, Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2014). A training seminar was held in Ethiopia to help build capacity for conservation of the species on its African wintering grounds (Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds 2013). A LIFE-Nature project in the Canary Islands has significantly enhanced adult and sub-adult survival through actions including education campaigns, control of illegal poisoning and modification of power lines (Badia-Boher <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian vultures was published in 2017 (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and an international Flyway Action Plan for the Central Asian and Balkan populations was initiated in 2015 in Bulgaria, encompassing the Balkans, Central Asia, Middle East, and East Africa (S. Oppel <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species is considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Uganda (WCS 2016).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Start and maintain intensive cooperation with local stakeholders to ensure poison- and poaching-free zones at sites with high densities or congregations of the species throughout the breeding, migration and wintering range, alongside similar efforts for other threatened species. Build capacity in countries along the migration flyways and in the wintering areas. There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies in Namibia (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). Research threats, monitor populations and protect key sites along migratory pathways and bottlenecks along the Red Sea Flyway (Buechley <em>et al. </em>2018). Protect nest sites where persecution is a problem. Research the causes and extent of current declines across the species's range. Insulate dangerous electricity pylons in areas where high mortality is recorded.  Coordinate monitoring to assess trends throughout the range. Relax the European Union sanitary regulations in relation to carcass disposal. Establish supplementary feeding sites based on rigorous scientific knowledge and under adaptive and appropriate management (Moreon-Opo <em>et al. </em>2015, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al. </em>2016). Raise awareness amongst pastoralists of the dangers of using diclofenac for livestock<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. Effectively reduce risks of poisoning through strict enforcement of poison-bait ban and education. Lobby for the banning of diclofenac for veterinary purposes throughout the species's range, and support the enforcement of this ban where it has been adopted. Where applicable, establish the impact of wind turbines, and lobby for effective impact assessments to be carried out prior to their construction. Where  appropriate, guard nests to reduce disturbance. Confiscate illegally  kept live birds and use them for the purposes of captive breeding and  future restocking and reintroduction programmes. In key areas of the  species's range, implement long-term and large-scale education and  community involvement programmes. The Flyway Action Plan for the conservation of the Egyptian Vulture in Central Asia and the Balkans (2017) additionally highlighted: the need to improve detection methods and better understand the causes of poisoning and illegal killing; legislation and enforcement to mitigate illegal killing; raise awareness of illegal killing; mitigate electrocution and collisions with energy infrastructure; raise awareness amongst planners and developers of dangerous energy infrastructure; monitor breeding pairs, productivity and success rate; protect breeding sites and foraging habitats; and ensure a successful <em>ex situ</em>&#160;Egyptian Vulture endangered species programme.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The majority of its range lies outside Europe where it was not thought to be declining at a sufficiently rapid rate to approach the threshold for Vulnerable. However recent information suggests that the population outside Europe may be exposed to greater threats than was previously thought and has also undergone very rapid recent declines across much of the range. It is therefore classified as Endangered.<p></p>,"It inhabits areas of steppe and semi-desert, and is recorded breeding up to 2,300 m in mountainous regions (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;It feeds mainly on small mammals on its breeding grounds, with susliks forming the vast majority of its diet in some areas; when wintering it appears to feed mainly on mole rats in East Africa, and termites and Red-billed Quelea&#160;<em>Quelea quelea</em>&#160;predominate in southern Africa (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;Nests have traditionally been built as large platforms on the ground, although recent habitat alterations seem to have caused a shift to building a few metres higher in bushes or trees (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). It also nests on artificial structures and will occur on rubbish grounds and waste sites (Keijmel 2019).&#160;The species is migratory, with birds wintering in south-east Africa and southern Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrants leave their breeding grounds between August and October/November, returning between January and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Subedi 2014). It avoids sea crossings and thus forms large concentrations at bottleneck sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","The species has declined in the west of its breeding range, including extirpation from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, as a result of the conversion of steppes to agricultural land combined with direct persecution (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Boesman 2013).&#160;It is also adversely affected by power lines and is very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (STRIX 2012, Meyburg and Boesman 2013). It was recently found to be the raptor most frequently electrocuted by power lines in a study in western Kazakhstan (Levin and Kurkin 2013) and in Saudi Arabia (Shobrak <em>et al. </em>2021). Three sets of factors have been identified as having detrimental impacts on the species in Russia and Kazakhstan: increased mortality owing to collisions with power lines, pesticide poisoning and direct persecution; a reduction in the area of suitable habitat and availability of food, historically due to overgrazing but now due to undergrazing, and to a lesser extent logging and mining; poor breeding success owing to destruction of nests and juvenile mortality during spring fires, entanglement of nestlings in artificial nest materials, and disturbance by people and livestock (Strategy of the Steppe Eagle Conservation in the Russian Federation 2016). Young eagles are taken out of the nest in order to sell them to western European countries (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). Recent studies using social media to assess impacts on wildlife found that the species was also being illegally killed in Jordan, of which the species is legally protected in the country (Eid and Handal 2018). A decline in the number of birds and a reduction in the proportion of juveniles migrating over Eilat, Israel began immediately after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, leading Yosef and Fornadari (2004) to suggest that the species may have been affected by radioactive contamination. This species is vulnerable to the veterinary drug diclofenac (Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014), which was intensively used in the species's wintering range in Pakistan and India (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004).","Combined totals from across the whole range estimate the number of pairs at 31,372 (26,014-36,731), which equates to 62,744 (52,028-73,462) mature individuals or 94,116 (78,042-110,193) individuals (I. Karyakin <em>in litt</em>. 2015). The global population is hence below 37,000 pairs (Karyakin <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"This species breeds east of 43°E in European <strong>Russia</strong> from the Republic of Kalmykia (I.

In Russia the population is estimated to be 2,478–3,688 breeding pairs (including 1,176–1,895 breeding pairs in European Russia), in Kazakhstan there are an estimated 22,000–31,000 pairs (I. Karyakin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The largest numbers are found within the Russian Federation: Republic of Kalmykia – 194 known breeding territories with an estimated 500-700 breeding pairs; Volgograd district – 50 known breeding pairs, estimated 300–500 breeding pairs; Orenburd district – 139 known breeding pairs, estimated 200–350 breeding pairs; Republic of Altai – 301 known breeding pairs, estimated 400–600 breeding pairs; Republic of Tyva – 140 known breeding pairs, estimated 300–400 breeding pairs (I.

Karyakin&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Migration studies observed 572 Steppe Eagles leaving the Tibetan plateau and heading to wintering grounds (possibly in the Middle East or Africa) in 2012, with a maximum observance of 1,102 individuals in 2013 and 6,166 individuals in 2014 at Thoolakharka, Nepal (Subedi 2014). More recently, 4,900 individuals were observed at a dump sites northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2019 (Keijmel 2019).

Improved information on its population size and trend may in due course lead to a reassessment of its status.,"The species breeds on dry rocky slopes and uplands with shrubby vegetation and sometimes conifers. It may also use areas with isolated trees, such as Pinus brutia, or taller bushes. It is migratory, wintering in dry open country with short grass, semi-desert, low rocky hills, bare cultivated land and dry scrub, often in coastal areas. On passage, it occurs on stony and rocky slopes/hillsides with low annual grasses and bushes, chiefly in desert uplands, with a few cultivated patches (Shirihai, 1996). Migrating birds are regularly recorded in lowland agricultural land and semi-deserts.<br/>In Turkey the breeding habitat ranges from c. 100–1800 m at least, thought to extend to sea level (Roselaar, 1995). The habitat is reported to extend to sea level in the Greek islands.","Changes in grazing pressure by sheep and goats could affect the population size. High grazing pressure could result in the trampling of nests, whereas too little grazing could reduce the area of open feeding sites<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Albayrak <em>et al</em>. 2003).

Suitable habitats in south-east Turkey have been flooded by dam construction, resulting both in direct habitat loss and the relocation of displaced villagers to new, currently unpopulated areas (Albayrak <em>et al</em>. 2003). Construction of wind farms and mining in the species's habitats in Turkey are further threats (S. Isfendiyaroglu <em>in litt</em>. 2015).

The population trend appears to be increasing, and past declines are not believed to have been be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over 10 years or three generations). The population size is moderately small to large, and it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in 10 years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>The species is fully migratory, leaving its Mediterranean breeding grounds in October and November to winter in Madagascar, East Africa and the Mascarene Islands. The return journey begins in late April and May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Birds are known to fly as high as 1,000 m during the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). They are generally gregarious (though sometimes solitary), tending to move in small and loose flocks, and on migration often associating with other species flying at high altitudes, including <em>F. subbuteo</em> (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They hunt mainly at twilight (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Habitat</strong> Birds usually breed and stop over on small islands and islets, wintering mainly in open woodland on Madagascar (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> It feeds on large flying insects and small birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Birds nest in the holes and ledges of sea cliffs, or on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> The species appears to require very peaceful or uninhabited islands on which to breed, with direct exploitation and development both shown to be negative consequences of close proximity to people; effective protection has led to strong recoveries where implemented (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","<p>The species has historically suffered from exploitation and persecution brought about by local people, including collecting chicks for food, although this practice has declined significantly (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). Human disturbance associated with tourism development has also been shown to negatively influence birds’ breeding success (Martínez-Abrain&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Orta and Kirwan 2014), and is present throughout much of the breeding range (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Disturbance and habitat degradation brought about by overgrazing and intensification of agriculture is a threat in many breeding areas (Ristow 1999; pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Predation by rats and cats is also important on many breeding islands (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Touati <em>et al. </em>2017). Accidental pesticide poisoning was thought to be responsible for a decline in the breeding population on Crete (Ristow and Xirouchakis 2000; Ristow 2001). The species is vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (STRIX 2012; Kassara <em>et al. </em>2019). Deforestation and persecution may be threats in the wintering grounds, however the impact of these is unknown (Ristow 1999). Climate change is also predicted to have a significant effect on this species, for example through increased incidence of wildfires causing deterioration of foraging habitat; a shift in the timing and distribution of autumn passerine migration affecting prey availability during the peak breeding season; a shift in both breeding and wintering range leading to reduced habitat availability and increased exposure to threats; and increased drought conditions limiting water availability at breeding sites and food availability during migration (Kassara <em>et al. </em>2019; Fric <em>et al. </em>2019)</p>","In Europe (which   covers &gt;95% of the breeding range), the population is estimated at 14,200-14,500 pairs, which equates to 28,400-28,900 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). The North African population is estimated at approximately 2,000-2,200 pairs, or 4,000-4,400 mature individuals (Garrido&#160;<em>et al. in prep.</em>).

In addition the species is protected by national laws in many countries within its range. An International Species Action Plan was published in 1999 (Ristow 1999) and was reviewed in 2010. A national action plan is established in Italy and regional action plans are in place in Spain. The species is also included in an Action Plan for the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Madagascar. Monitoring programmes exist in most European countries at a national level and in protected areas in Greece, Spain and Cyprus (Barov and Derhé 2011). Private research on the species has been conducted on an archipelago off Crete for three decades, in collaboration with the University of Heidelberg and the area became an SPA in 1997 (Ristow 1999). An EU LIFE Nature project, ‘Conservation measures for&#160;<em>Falco eleonorae</em>&#160;in Greece’ was set up in 2003, which met with much success performing the first ever global population census of Eleonora’s falcon, undertaking many public awareness campaigns, and reducing nest predation through rat eradication programmes. Another LIFE project, 'Conservation measures to assist the adaptation of <em>Falco eleonorae </em>to climate change' was set up in 2013. The Conservatoire du Littoral has been coordinating, since 2005, an international programme for the promotion and assistance for the management of Mediterranean insular micro-spaces, known as the PIM Initiative for the Mediterranean Small Islands, which is financed by the Fonds Français pour l’Environnement Mondial (FFEM) (French Global Environment Facility), the Agence de l’eau Rhône Méditerranée-Corse and the City of Marseille. This programme has supported monitoring programmes in Tunisia and Morocco, where the species has been monitored for a long time in its main colony in the Essaouira islands (Qninba et al. 2016). Research on the species has been conducted in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. A net expansion of the species has been observed in Morocco thanks to the end of the direct persecutions (Rguibi et al. 2012a). In Morocco, the species is included in the preparation of a strategy for conservation of birds of prey (https://www.iucn.org/news/mediterranean/202001/first-steps-towards-a-moroccan-strategy-raptor-conservation-iucns-guidance).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Effective actions to protect coastal areas should be implemented and Environmental Impact Assessments conducted on all developments in coastal areas.

However, recent evidence indicates a stable or slightly positive population trend overall during the last three generations. Consequently it has been listed as Least Concern because it no longer approaches any of the thresholds for Vulnerable under the IUCN criteria. <p></p> <p></p>","It is usually a colonial breeder, often in the vicinity of human settlements. It forages in steppe-like habitats, natural and managed grasslands, and non-intensive cultivation. It is mainly migratory, with most breeders overwintering in sub-Saharan Africa, although some travel to parts of north-west Africa, southern Europe and southern Asia. Migrants leave their breeding grounds in September and return between February and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). It migrates in flocks of varying sizes, usually tens to low hundreds, often with other falcons such as <em>F. tinnunculus</em>, <em>F. vespertinus</em> and <em>F. amurensis</em> (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Large numbers, sometimes up to thousands, gather at roosts on migration (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). They cross water bodies readily on a broad front, flying high enough to be barely detectable; they fly lower over land (often c.20-30 m), particularly on northward migration (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<br/><p></p>","The main cause of its decline in the second half of the 20th century was habitat loss and degradation in its Western Palearctic breeding grounds, primarily a result of agricultural intensification, but also afforestation of low-productive farmland with wood plantations, land abandonment and urbanisation (Iñigo &amp; Barov 2010). The use of pesticides caused drastic reduction in prey, poisoning and reduced breeding success (during the period of DDT use) (Orta &amp; Kirwan 2020).&#160;In South Africa, key grasslands have been lost to agricultural intensification, afforestation and intensive pasture management (Pepler 2000). The neglect or restoration of old buildings has resulted in the loss of nest-sites (Davygora 1998, J.-P. Biber <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>.</em> 1999). At La Crau in southern France, where such nest sites are rare, a population increase in the 1990s may be linked to the progressive selection of ground nests in stone piles, reducing interspecific and intraspecific competition (Prugnolle <em>et al.</em> 2003). Survival of juveniles overwintering in the Sahel region is strongly correlated with rainfall (Mihoub&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010), therefore an increased frequency of draught conditions brought about by climate change is likely to affect the species. High levels of chick mortality recorded during unusually hot weather (particularly in nest boxes) may also be a cause of concern given projected levels of global warming (Orta &amp; Kirwan 2020). Collision with power cables or wind turbines may pose an additional threat (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018; Pescador <em>et al. </em>2019). Lesser Kestrels may be trapped in North Africa to use as lures to attract target species, however this is not thought to be a significant threat (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>). In some areas, nests may be deliberately destroyed due to sanitary concerns or the noise produced by the birds (Iñigo &amp; Barov 2010).","The European population is estimated at 32,900-42,600 pairs, which equates to 65,800-85,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Several thousand pairs breed outside this range, principally in central Asia. The population in China has been estimated at c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration (Brazil 2009). The population in Kazakhstan has been estimated at 5,000-10,000 pairs (Wassink &amp; Oreel, cited in Orta &amp; Kirwan 2020). The population in North Africa is estimated to be at least 2,500-3,000 breeding pairs (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>). Global population estimates vary significantly, from 50,000-60,000 individuals (Pilard 2005, cited in Global Raptor Network 2021) to 120,000 individuals (Fishpool 1997, cited in Global Raptor Network 2021) and even 650,000-800,000 (Cade 1982).&#160;Wintering population estimates include a roost in Senegal of up to 28,000 individuals in January 2007 (Demey <em>et al. </em>2012), and 88,976 in south Africa based on roost counts in 2006/2007 (Global Raptor Network 2021).

Several thousand pairs breed outside this range, principally in central Asia. Western Palearctic populations have undergone serious declines, although a few have begun to increase again. The western European population has declined by c.95% since 1950, and the species has disappeared from the Ural region of Russia and from northern Kazakhstan, as well as from the western and central parts of the Balkan Peninsula (Davygora 1998, B. Barov<em> in litt.</em> 2007). However, some populations in south-western and central Europe are stable or increasing (Iñigo and Barov 2010) and eastern breeding populations are also reported to be stable (Galushin 2009). Italy has seen a marked population increase and range expansion since 2000 (N. Baccetti<em> in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2010), and the population in Andalucía, Spain, increased from c.2,100 pairs in 1988 to c.4,800 in 2009 (J. R. Garrido<em> in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2011). In Kazakhstan, the species appears to be stable or increasing slightly, perhaps in association with the abandonment of villages and livestock stations in the 1990s (J.

Coordinated counts of the South African wintering population recorded 117,000 birds in 2005/2006 (van Zyl 2007, A. van Zyl <em>in litt. </em>2007) and 98,000 birds in 2006/2007 (A. van Zyl <em>in litt. </em>2007), but it is not clear whether this represents a genuine reduction in numbers or whether the missing birds were wintering elsewhere, most likely in East Africa (A. van Zyl <em>in litt. </em>2007).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The species lives on rocky sea coasts, breeding on cliff ledges and under boulders in boreal or low Arctic waters&#160;where sea-surface temperatures &lt;15°C&#160;(Nettleship, 1996; Lavers <em>et al., </em>2020). It is a pursuit diver that propels itself through the water with its wings. Razorbills are capable of diving to 120 m depth, but mostly forage nearer the surface. They spend most of their lives at sea, only arriving ashore to reproduce. They mainly overwinter within the boreal water zone either side of the Atlantic (Lavers <em>et al., </em>2020). This species has been described as coastal rather than pelagic (Huettman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005), and birds tend to be concentrated within 10 km of the shore (BirdLife International, 2000, Huettman&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2005). They are known to consume Krill, Sprat <em>Sprattus sprattus</em>, Sandeels <em>Ammondytes</em> spp. and Capelin amongst other prey (Nettleship, 1996).","<p>The major threats for the razorbill are current and future impacts of climate change, decreasing prey availability, bycatch in gillnets and driftnets, and unregulated hunting (Costa <em>et al., </em>2019). As a pursuit diver, the species is at risk from being caught in gill-nets and drift-nets, with gill-net fisheries in the North and Baltic Seas known to catch significant numbers (Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013, Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011). Overfishing of important prey species in the Gulf of St Lawrence, east Newfoundland and Grand Banks, Georges Bank, North Sea and Barents Sea is also a threat due to reduction in prey populations (Nettleship, 2018). The role of IUU fishing in prey reductions has not been evaluated (Costa <em>et al., </em>2019).&#160;Razorbills are also at risk from climate change related reductions in the abundance of prey such as Sandeels due to their restricted diet (Sandvik<em> et al.&#160;</em>2005). Past food shortages have coincided with declines in productivity in the North-east of the UK, as well as a decrease in energy content of fish brought to chicks on the Isle of May (Wanless <em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). There are indications that the decline in Sandeel stocks is linked to increasing sea surface temperatures (Heath <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). A significant negative relationship between productivity and spring sea surface temperature, lagged by one year, has been found, this has been linked to the availability of mid-trophic level forage fish (Lauria <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, a study by Gaston and Woo (2008) showed Razorbills were able to track changes in preferred prey, implying a capability to adapt to climate change. The species is vulnerable to extreme weather, primarily winter storms, which have been linked to large scale mortality in the past (Underwood and Stowe, 1984), due to strong winds preventing feeding and weakening adults. Razorbills are also potentially vulnerable to future sea level rises that may cause flooding in some parts of its range (Sandvik, 2005).</p>  <p>Hunting of adults occurs throughout range, with between 2,000 and 200,000 birds killed each year in Iceland, 20% of which are taken illegally (BirdLife International, 2017). Unregulated hunting occurs in Labrador, Newfoundland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, and Norway (Nettleship <em>et al. </em>2018). Egg collection is thought to have caused declines in the past (Nettleship et al. 2018), but is not considered only a minor issue in the Norwegian North Sea and Skagerrak (TemaNord 2010). This species is considered to be at moderate risk of displacement by offshore windfarms in the UK, but at low risk of collision mortality (Bradbury <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014), with windfarms having a low impact in general (Furness <em>et al.</em> 2013). Studies on the effects of offshore windfarms on Razorbills return variable results, with the population declining around some and remaining stable or increasing around other (Dierschke <em>et al.</em> 2016). An investigation into the potential impacts of offshore windfarms by van Kooten <em>et al., </em>(2018) returned annual population declines of 0.939 and 0.926 for extreme scenarios, while worst-case and best-estimates showed median annual population increases. The effects are thought to depend on the distance to breeding and foraging grounds and effect on prey populations (Vanerman <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, Razorbills were highlighted as one of more vulnerable species to the adverse effects of tidal turbines off Scottish waters (Furness <em>et al.</em> 2012). </p>  <p>Invasive mammalian predators, especially rats and American mink (<em>Neovison vison</em>), represent a threat to Razorbill populations. Presence of rat activity has been linked with declines in Razorbill productivity through disturbance on Calf of Man, U.K. (O'Hanlon and Lambert 2017). The Isle of Canna, West coast Scotland, has also seen declines in Razorbills since early 1990 with introduction of Norway rats which have been observed predating eggs and chicks (Swann 2002). Numbers of Razorbill increased following successful rat eradication on the island in 2005/06 (Swann <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Colonies suffer local declines due to American mink and are at high risk of predation, e.g. a decline of 60% was seen in SW Finland after introduction of mink in 1970s, with the removal of mink being followed by return of breeding colonies (Nordstrom <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003). American mink have had a 'verified impact' in Finland and Sweden (Bonesi &amp; Palazon 2007). Excessive predation by mink can cause exceptionally low chick mean survival rates (Barrett 2015). </p>  <p>Razorbills spend the majority of their time at and below the water surface, leading them to be highlighted as vulnerable to habitat degradation, species mortality and loss of reproductive success due to oilspills. Oiling affects Razorbills’ ability to feed and fly (Biliavskiy and Golod 2012). An assessment of the threat that marine aggregate mining poses to Razorbill around the UK suggests that operations would cause disturbance, potentially restrict access to some foraging sites and that the Firth of Forth colonies (c. 2,700 pairs) would be exposed to direct effects through reduced prey availability (Cook and Burton<em>&#160;</em>2010). At present the threat is likely to be at a very minor scale and to have minimal severity, but many areas of the Arctic are opening up to mining developments that may pose a threat to breeding seabirds (Chardine and Mendenhall 1998). High levels of mercury (Hg) found in Razorbills recovered from 2014 winter wreck. Although levels were unlikely to be directly responsible for the high mortality observed, it was concluded to be a major aggravating stress factor for emaciated birds on the edge, with evidence suggesting that stranded seabirds were highly contaminated compared to birds in normal conditions (Fort<em> et al.&#160;</em>2015).</p>","The global population is estimated to number between 838,000-1,660,000 mature individuals, or 1,257,000-2,490,000 total individuals, derived from flyway population estimates (Wetlands International, 2021). The European population is estimated at 519,000-1,070,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). This species breeds mostly in Iceland, a population that was once believed to make up 60-70% of the global population (Costa <em>et al., </em>2019); now, Iceland holds the majority in Europe (41%) but not globally due to increases elsewhere.

North American birds migrate offshore and south, ranging from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland (<strong>Canada</strong>) to New England and New York (U.S.A.) (Nettleship 1996).

Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean.

While persecution has decreased significantly since the species received legal protection, illegal persecution still occurs in some areas, for example four Peregrines were confirmed illegally poisoned and nine shot, trapped, or nests destroyed in the UK in 2014 (RSPB 2014). Severe population declines in the 1960s-1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Rock climbing activities may pose a threat to the species's nest sites (Global Raptor Information Network 2015), and careless methods of field study may result in abandonment of eggs (White <em>et al. </em>2020). In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). In North Africa, the main threat to the species is illegal trapping and collection of nestlings for use in falconry (Garrido <em>et al. in prep</em>). It is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012), and collision or electrocution from electricity cables may be common in some areas (White <em>et al. </em>2020). An oil spill in northern Spain was thought to have reduced reproductive success and caused adult mortality in the local population (Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2006). Urban fledglings are at threat from collisions with cars, windows and other man-made objects (White <em>et al. </em>2020). Warming of sea temperatures may reduce plankton and associated seabirds that serve as a food source for some populations of Peregrine Falcons (Nelson &amp; Myres 1976).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020) estimate the population in the USA/ Canada to be c.72,000 individuals. The North African population is estimated to be 2,290-2,900 pairs (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>). The European population is estimated at 16,100-31,100 pairs, which equates to 32,200-62,100 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms approximately 13% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 248,000-478,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. The population is therefore placed in the band 100,000-499,999 mature individuals.",Increasing,,"The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).

It is mainly diurnal although partly crepuscular and even nocturnal to some extent on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>It occurs in open wooded areas, and has been recorded up to 4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> Flying insects form the main part of its diet, although birds are often taken in the breeding season (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Birds almost always nest in trees, using abandoned nests of other raptors or corvids (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> The species requires trees in which to nest, so although preferring generally open areas in the breeding season it will avoid those that are completely deforested (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","<p>The cutting of old growth forest patches in Ukraine is thought to have caused local declines (Orta <em>et al. </em>2020). Agricultural intensification poses a threat through removal of nesting trees and reduction of prey availability such as insects and farmland birds (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001). Shooting is a significant cause of mortality during migration, notably in Malta where hunters are thought to kill 500-600 individuals each year (Sultana 1996, cited in Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001). A growing threat is human disturbance associated with silvicultural and hunting activities during the breeding season (Sergio&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001).&#160;Pesticide use has likely had only minor impacts, as has egg-collecting, which tends to be a local issue (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Large increases in Goshawk populations in some countries has led to higher predation rates of both Eurasian Hobby and corvid species, causing direct mortality and reducing the availability of nest sites (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001).

Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October, and those arriving in sub-Saharan Africa do so from October onwards (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The return journey begins from February through until April (the exact time probably dependent on food availability), and is often undertaken in small mixed groups with <em>F. naumanni</em> and occasionally <em>F. vespertinus </em>(Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species can be solitary or gregarious, being most often seen singly but sometimes travelling in flocks of up to 10 individuals, especially on migration. Larger groups may congregate at sources of abundant food. It is mainly diurnal (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species tolerates a wide range of open and partially forested habitats, and has been recorded up to 4,500 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>It feeds mainly on small mammals, particularly in northern Europe, with insects possibly more important in Africa and the Mediterranean (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The locations of nests are variable, with rock ledges, buildings and abandoned corvid nests being commonly reported sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>Birds require suitable perches and roosting sites, usually provided by trees, telegraph poles, buildings or rock faces (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","<p>Past population declines resulted from the heavy use of organochlorine and other pesticides in the 1950s-1960s (Orta and Boesman 2013). Use of anticoagulant rodenticides is of increasing concern (Roos <em>et al. </em>2021), and studies in southwest Spain suggest that some individuals may be exposed to toxic levels of inorganic elements (Manzano <em>et al. </em>2021). In Malta, the species was exterminated by shooting, though it has since returned (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The population in much of the rest of Europe has shown a more recent steady decline, thought to be due to agricultural intensification (Snow and Perrins 1998).

Migratory birds winter in southern Africa and southern Asia; northern birds leave their breeding grounds in September and return in March and April, and those breeding in South Africa move northwards in March and return in August (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrants are thought to partially cross water on a broad front (assumed from regular occurrence on islands across the Mediterranean), but nevertheless many pass through bottleneck short crossing points each season. Birds tend to be seen singly or in pairs, and even on migration rarely form groups of more than five, and stay away from other raptors (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds soar c.200-300 m above the ground when hunting (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat </strong>It is a species of open woodland, preferring patches of forest interspersed with open areas; it is recorded up to 3,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Small birds are the most important part of its diet (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built in trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>A mixture of woodland and open areas such as agricultural fields is optimal for this species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Threats affecting the species include habitat degradation, direct persecution and human disturbance (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta and Boesman 2013).

In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing, and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). The accumulation of organochloride pesticides in wintering areas may affect the species’s reproductive success (Tucker and Heath 1994).&#160;In the past, organochlorine contamination may have been a contributory factor in the population decline in south-east Spain (Martinez-Lopez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012). Powerlines were responsible for 19.5% of Booted Eagles mortalities in Spain during 1990-2006, with the number of cases increasing throughout the period (Martinez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In the same study, illegal killing was responsible for 32.5% of mortalities, however the number of cases decreased significantly during the study period. The majority (19.5%) of killings were shootings, however nest robbing and captivity, trapping, and poisoning also occurred (Martinez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Poaching was also identified as a threat in Armenia, primarily due to fears over them killing domestic birds such as chickens and pigeons (Aghababyan &amp; Stepanyan 2020). Several Booted Eagles were shot during migration on Malta in 2016 (RSPB 2017). The trade of this species in Moroccan markets has been reported (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>).

Migrants begin moving to lower latitudes in August and arrive by October, returning in March and April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are generally solitary and usually migrate alone, but may congregate in small groups at roosts or plentiful food sources (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).

Pesticide use has now been reduced to a minor, and largely historical, threat. However shooting still affects many birds on migration in the Mediterranean (Monti <em>et al. </em>2018b), as well as wintering birds in tropical regions including Latin America and the West Indies (Global Raptor Information Network 2015).&#160;A few Australian birds are apparently impacted by local human disturbance (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).<br/><br/>It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).

Though there is no direct evidence for its effect on osprey populations, intensive trawler fishing is likely to deplete fish stocks and affect prey availability. Other fishing practices are also likely damaging; copper sulphate fishing may lead to poisoning and motor boats may disturb osprey nests (Monti <em>et al. </em>2013).

Those elsewhere are resident (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). Migrants move south between August and November and make the return journey between February and May. Birds tend to occur singly or in pairs, sometimes forming small family groups at roosts. However, they can migrate in groups, and as birds avoid sea crossings (and even freshwater bodies) as far as possible, they form huge concentrations at peninsulas and narrow straits (Brown&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migration is strictly diurnal, and also often follows mountain ranges and ridges (Brown&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982).&#160;<strong>Habitat&#160;</strong>It inhabits a wide variety of habitats but requires at least some tree cover for nesting and roosting; ideal habitat appears to be forest edge, or mosaics of forest and open areas (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). In winter also uses more open areas, such as steppe, pasture and wetlands, migrants within Africa also use savanna (Global raptor information network, 2021).&#160;<strong>Diet </strong>It is versatile depending on the prey animals available, with small mammals usually predominating, but in some areas invertebrates making up the majority (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).&#160;<strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is built on a fork or branch of a large tree, usually near to forest edge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).&#160;<strong>Management information </strong>Although versatile in its habitat choice, trees are required particularly on its breeding grounds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Historically the most important threat has been persecution from shooting and poisoned bait traps (Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Whilst persecution is now illegal in much of the Eurasian Buzzards' range and perceptions towards raptors have improved, reducing levels of shooting, in other regions it is still a considerable threat (Kalpakis&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009, Cianchetti-Benedetti&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016). In agricultural areas unintentional poisoning from pesticides and rodenticides, or ingestion of led shot are likely causing some localised declines (Coeurdassier&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003, Battaglia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).

Whilst it is a generalist species able to use agricultural and suburban areas, it shows preference for mosiac habitats near woodland, and as such it has suffered from wide-spread agricultural intensification and urban development due to the removal of suitable trees for nesting sites, fragmentation and loss of connectivity with woodlands&#160;(Sergio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Butet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Asian populations are effected by low levels of use and hunting on breeding grounds, as live birds are traded at bird markets in Kuwait (Al-Sirhan &amp; Al-Bathali 2010) and hunted for sport in Jordan (Eid &amp; Handal 2018), but also on migration (Sandor&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;Little is known about threats facing this migratory populations which spend the non-breeding period in southern Africa.","<p>The European population is estimated at 882,000-1,230,000 pairs, which equates to 1,760,000-2,460,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International&#160;<em>in prep</em>).&#160;Europe forms approximately 75% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 2,038,000-3,463,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

Modern forestry methods reduce the availability of suitable nesting habitat (Orta <em>et al</em>. 2013). Organochlorine pesticide and heavy metal pollution resulted in reductions in breeding success, particularly in the Baltic region (Orta <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although some losses may be taking place in Asian Russia owing to increased logging and oil industry development, these are outweighed by increases in Europe.<br/>Accidental lead poisoning from spent ammunition remains a considerable source of mortality in Finland (Isomursu <em>et al. </em>2018), with other anthropogenic causes of death including collisions with traffic and power lines or deliberate shooting. Overall, this study found that anthropogenic factors accounted for 60% of eagle deaths. Loss of large trees has left a deficit of suitable nesting sites, and increasing habituation to humans has meant that eagles nest closer to cities (Shiraki 2018). This has increased the number of collisions between eagles and traffic, and may be linked to lower breeding success (ibid). Collisions with wind turbines is an additional source of mortality (Heuck <em>et al.</em> 2019; Matsuda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2021), though the risk can be mitigated with adaptive management (Matsuda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;<br/>Birds are occasionally threatened by outbreaks of avian influenza virus (Krone <em>et al. </em>2018).","In Europe, the   breeding population is estimated to number 10,400-14,600 breeding pairs,   equating to 20,900-29,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).

Birds are mostly solitary except on migration, when they flock throughout, gathering in large numbers at preferred crossing points as well as roosting socially (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Porter and Aspinall 2010). They fly chiefly by soaring, although are able to cross wide stretches of water with flapping flight (Snow and Perrins 1998; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is diurnal (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<strong><br/>Habitat </strong>The European Honey-buzzard is a forest species, typically breeding in lowland or mid altitude undisturbed temperate or boreal woodland, but it has been recorded up to 2,000 m (Orta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). It is also found in wooded farmland, small wetlands and meadows however (Global Raptor Information Network 2021), suggesting a slight tolerance to&#160;cultivated areas. During the non-breeding period in Africa, the species uses woodland, wooded savannah, farmbush and forest edge.&#160;<strong><br/>Diet</strong>&#160;Predominately an insectivore, mainly feeding&#160;on wasps and hornets but also noted to take flying termites and locusts in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> Nests are built in woods, preferentially in deciduous trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong><br/>Management information</strong> The species appears to require dense forest on its wintering grounds in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","<p>Many birds are shot on migration, notably in Italy, Malta and Lebanon (del Hoyo&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2; text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial;text-decoration-color: initial;word-spacing: 0px"">et al.</em>&#160;1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and particularly in Georgia. In Georgia the species is hunted for sort, consumption and medicinal properties which means it is the most commonly hunted raptor on migration (van Maanen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Recently it was estimated that hunting in Georgia effects 1.1% of the migratory population which is annually recorded in passage in the country (Hoekstra&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), suggesting low, but significant declines. Direct mortality from shooting on migration was recorded as the highest cause of mortality (De Pascalis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), and whilst European Honey-buzzards suffer from collision-mortality from vehicles and electrocution (Fransson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), these appear more minor compared to shooting. Wind farm projects constructed on main migration routes could be a significant threat, as the species is highly vulnerable to Collison with turbines (Hilgerloh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011; STRIX 2012).<br/>While declines in northern Europe are thought to have resulted from deforestation and forest conversion in the past, European Honey-Buzzards appear relatively robust to changes in breeding habitat, suggesting mortality on migration or during non-breeding grounds is of greater threat (Björklund&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Although pesticide use has not had significant impacts in Europe (due to the species living in woodland and feeding on wasps), it may do in Africa, where there are fewer restrictions on usage and the species may be poisoned through its locust prey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<br/>Relatively less information is available for threats which occur during the African non-breeding period. However, within Africa birds appear reliant on large tracts of continuous forest suggesting widespread deforestation and fragmentation is likely negatively impacting honey-buzzards in Africa (Howes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). &#160;</p>","Ferguson-Lees <em>et al</em>. (2001) estimated the population to number 100,000-1,000,000 individuals, with regional estimates suggesting between 10,000-15,000 pairs in France (Dubois <em>et al</em>. 2008), 1,850 in Spain (Palomino and Valls 2011), 8,000-11,000 in Belarus (Dombrovski and Ivanovski 2005) and 60,000-80,000 in European Russia (Galushin 2012). In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 120,000-175,000 breeding pairs, equating to 241,000-350,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.). Europe forms approximately 82% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 294,000-427,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. The global population size is likely much larger than this however, with an annual mean of 528,000 individuals (mostly adults) counted each year passing through the Batumi migratory bottleneck, with 180,000 individuals counted on a single day in 2012 (Hoekstra <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;Hence a revised global estimate is 290,000-430,000 mature individuals.",Stable,"The species breeds across Europe and western Asia, from <strong>Spain </strong>and <strong>France </strong>in the west of its range, across to eastern Scandinavia through to western <strong>Russia</strong>&#160;as far as <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, with the southerly breeding populations in the northern Mediterranean. It is a long distance migrant which spends the non-breeding period in sub-Sahara Africa, where it can be found throughout southern Africa. During migration, the species typically uses the major migration routes to reach sub-Sahara Africa, using sites throughout the Iberian Peninsula and western Africa in the west, whilst in the east it can be found throughout the Mediterranean and the middle east.","Many birds are shot on migration, notably in Italy, Malta and Lebanon (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), but particularly in Georgia. In Georgia the species is hunted for sort, consumption and medicinal properties, as such it is the most commonly hunted raptor on migration (van Maanen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Hoekstra <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;Direct mortality from shooting on migration was recorded as the highest cause of mortality (De Pascalis <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation actions underway</strong><br/>The species is listed on CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendix II and Raptors MoU Annex 1. Occurs in protected areas throughout its entire range, whilst in Europe it occurs in 3353 Natura 2000 sites.

Quantify loses from hunting through the Mediterranean and middle east, enforce legislation in Europe and advocate for legislation in the middle east, to reduce hunting activity.

208031565,14176,Myotis lucifugus,Endangered,A3be,2021,2018-02-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is assessed as Endangered A3be because it is suspected that a reduction in the total number of mature individuals of more than 50% will occur over the next three generations (15-30 years) based on predicted infection rates of the remaining populations within 12-18 years at similar mortality levels as recorded in the eastern range (94% decline in known winter hibernacula population). Approximately 50% of the global range of this small bat is found in eastern North America, subpopulations in these part of the range have been devastated by white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease caused by an introduced pathogen. This disease was first detected in North America in 2006, and to date has caused &gt;90% overall decline in known numbers of hibernating <em>Myotis </em>bats in several areas of Canada and the US. The current range of the disease has been expanding at an average rate of 200-250 km per year. At that rate, the entire population is likely to be affected within 12 to 18 years. There is no apparent containment of the northward or westward spread of the pathogen, and proper growing conditions for it exist throughout the remaining range.","Little Brown Bats inhabit forested lands near water, but some subspecies can be found in dry climates where water is not readily available. In those habitats, drinking water is provided by moisture on cave walls or condensation on the fur. This species occurs over a wide latitudinal and elevational range, but tend to be more abundant in areas with suitable hibernation sites (Wilson and Ruff 1999). They feed mainly on aquatic insects such as caddis flies, mayflies and midges, sometimes, they eat mosquitoes too. This is a species most commonly found flying around houses in North America.<br/><br/>During the winter, hibernation time depends on altitude and location of  the roosts. It usually starts between September and November and ends in  March to May. They do not migrate long distances for hibernation  roosts. Individuals travel only up to 100 miles. This species does not show territoriality at roosts, and large colonies  of as many as 300,000 bats have been reported in a single roost (Barbour  and Davis 1969). The lifespan of this species is extended by their  ability to find food and inhabit a variety of roosts. These  characteristics allow expansion of their habitat to new ranges, but also  contribute to their survival.&#160;<em>Myotis lucifugus</em>&#160;lives  approximately 6 to 7 years and often live well beyond 10 years. A 31  year-old male was discovered in southeastern Ontario. Evidence indicates  that males tend to live longer than females (Humphrey and Cope 1976).","Major threats to this species at present include a fungal disease known as white-nose syndrome (WNS) affecting hibernating colonies of several temperate bat species, that&#160;has devastated eastern North American bat populations at hibernation sites since 2007 (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010, BCI 2012).&#160;Wind power is another emerging threat to bats: wind turbines have been shown to fatally impact all bat species in Wisconsin (Arnett <em>et al</em>. 2008). Wind-turbine blades cause mortality through direct impact or through the pressure differential caused by the motion of the spinning blades. More research is under way to better understand bat wind-turbine vulnerabilities, but current studies suggest that bats face the greatest risk during migration from summer foraging sites to wintering grounds (tree bats) or hibernacula (cave bats) (Kunz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010). Model predictions for <em>Myotis lucifugus</em> in northeastern US predict 99% probability of functional extirpation by 2026. In addition, these bats use to inhabit attics, roofs, trees, and other areas in close proximity to humans, therefore, homeowners have spent large amounts of money trying to eradicate <em>M. lucifugus</em> from these areas (Fenton and Barclay 1980).","Population size is unknown but <em>M. lucifugus</em> was likely over six million prior to the 2007 arrival of White-nose Syndrome (WNS) to America (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010). As of 2006, regional mean growth suggested that the northeastern core population of this species was stable or slightly increasing (Frick <em>et al.</em> 2010b), and, pre-WNS population of this species was viable and did not face imminent risk of extinction. This species was considered to be common in much of their range in eastern Canada and northeastern US (Wilson and Ruff 1999), and is still common in Canada outside the range of WNS.&#160;Mortality rates at some hibernation sites have been as high as 90% (BCI 2012).&#160;As emerging science has confirmed, the best available evidence conservatively predicts a 99% chance of Little Brown Bat extinction in the northeastern U.S. by at least 2026, and potentially much sooner depending on the actualized mortality rates that result as the disease continues its rapid spread (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Decreasing,"<em>Myotis lucifugus</em> is found from Alaska (USA) to Labrador and Newfoundland (Canada), south to Southern California, Northern Arizona, Northern New Mexico (USA) (Simmons 2005). Mexican populations usually listed under this name actually correspond to <em>M. occultus</em>, a distinct species (Piaggio <em>et al</em>. 2002). Little Brown Bats are absent from much of Florida, the southern Great Plains regions of the U.S., southern California, and parts of coast Virginia and the Carolinas (Fenton and Barclay 1980).",,Terrestrial,"Natural hibernacula can be managed to encourage bat use. For example, closing but not sealing the entrance to an abandoned mine not only buffers temperature and humidity, but also reduces disturbance from humans and predators. Eliminating disturbance from humans, except for WNS surveillance, is the best management activity for natural cave hibernacula.&#160;Therefore, avoid entering hibernacula during winter hibernation (October through May) unless conducting approved and permitted management, surveillance, or research.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
