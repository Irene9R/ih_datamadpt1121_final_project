Although global population decline has not been observed for this species,&#160;<em>S. cantharus</em>&#160;exhibits life history characteristics that make it particularly vulnerable to local over-exploitation.&#160;<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus&#160;</em>is a hermaphrodite that is slow growing, long-lived, and exhibits habitat specificity during the spawning season. It is targeted by fisheries when it forms&#160;aggregations around nesting areas, and although fishery regulations for this species are limited, marine protected areas offer protection throughout its range.&#160;Therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern.                 Continued monitoring of its population status and harvest levels is recommended.<br/><br/><strong>Europe</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In Europe, this species is widespread and relatively common. Although localized declines have been reported, there is no evidence that indicate major global declines. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.","<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus </em>is a&#160;demersal species inhabiting the continental shelf, especially on seagrass beds and rocky or sandy bottoms to about 300 m depth, mainly between 10 m and 100 m (Pajuelo and Lorenzo&#160;1999). Juveniles are found in shallower water, to about 50 m depth&#160;and will remain inshore until about two to three years of age (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999, Collin and Mallinson 2012).&#160;The maximum total length of this species is 60 cm (Fischer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1987) and can live to about 15 years (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999).&#160;This species will form sizeable schools on occasion.&#160;<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus </em>is a&#160;relatively long-lived and slow-growing species feeding mainly on algae and small invertebrates (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Spondyliosoma cantharus </em>are&#160;protogynous&#160;hermaphrodites, and the age at sex-change is reported to occur at various stages (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999). Females of this species may reach sexual maturity around two years of age at a length of 17.3 cm TL, and males reach maturity at three years of age at a length of 22.7 cm TL (Perodou and Nedelec 1980, Soletchnik 1983, Balguerías 1995, Parjuelo and Lorenzo 1999). This species has also been reported to mature into males at approximately 20 cm, remaining as males until reaching 30 cm, with all individuals over 40 cm being female (Pawson 1995, Collins and Mallinson 2012). Sexual dimorphism in body color has been reported for this species during the spawning season and is probably associated with sexual competition, courtship and mating (Smale 1988). Spawning takes place&#160;from November to April, with a peak in spawning activity in January to February&#160;(Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999). In the northern part of its range,&#160;<em>S. cantharus</em>&#160;move to deep waters in winter, and migrate inshore to breed off the United Kingdom from March to May. Spawning off Portugal occurs in the southwest from February to April, peaking in March (Gonçalves and Erzini 2000). These results are in a good agreement with those reported for the same species in the northwest African coasts, in the English Channel, and in the Cantabrian Sea (southern Bay of Biscay). This species&#160;lays eggs in a nest constructed by the males on exposed gravel or sand, with each nest containing several thousands eggs. Males of this species will protect the nest and its contents until the eggs are hatched (Collin and Mallinson 2012). The total potential annual fecundity varies between 31,670 and 554,070 &#160;(average = 292,870) eggs per female. The relative fecundity of this species reaches a maximum of 850 eggs per gram in the 30.5 cm to 31 cm length class (Dulcic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998).<p></p>","<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus </em>is an important commercially harvested fish, and thus faces threats from fisheries. The value of the exploitation rate &gt;0.50 suggests that&#160;<em>S. cantharus</em>&#160;populations off the Canary Islands are heavily exploited. The value of the length at first capture (16.8 cm) is less than that of the length at first maturity and over 45% of the total catch is less than this length, indicating a danger of overfishing (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999).&#160;<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus&#160;</em>is particularly susceptible to overexploitation during its nesting season, when it aggregates around nesting sites and is then exploited by recreational and commercial fishers. This species is also vulnerable to habitat degradation from dredging, as this activity removes the coarse sediments that&#160;<em>S. cantharus&#160;</em>use for nest building. Spawned eggs can also be smothered by sediment deposited during dredging which inhibits embryonic development (Haskoning 2003,&#160;Collins and Mallinson 2012).","<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus&#160;</em>is widespread and&#160;is reasonably common throughout most of its range. <em>Spondyliosoma cantharus </em>is abundant in shallow waters along the southern coast of the United Kingdom (Rogers <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998), and the annual frequency of this species off Plymouth increased from 1913 to 2003 with the rising sea temperature as a result of climate change (Arkley and Caslake 2004). An increasing trend in abundance was also observed in the English Channel from 1993 to 2001 (Parker-Humphreys 2005). This species is heavily exploited in Portuguese waters, and the high exploitation rates suggest that this species may be locally over-fished&#160;(Gonçalves and Erzini 2000). However, global population decline has not been observed for this species.<br/><br/>FAO capture production data in 2012 were: Benin - three tonnes; Greece 105 tonnes; Morocco 1,598 tonnes; Senegal - 1,431 tonnes; Germany - two tonnes; Spain - 897 tonnes; France 2,667 tonnes; Netherlands - 69 tonnes; Portugal - 187 tonnes; United Kingdom 157 tonnes; Angola - 26 tonnes; Croatia - seven tonnes; Italy 70 tonnes; and Turkey - 49 tonnes.",Unknown,"<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus</em>&#160;is widely distributed in the eastern Atlantic, occurring from Scandinavia to Namibia, and around the Madeira, Azores, Cape Verde and Canary Islands. It is also common in the Mediterranean&#160;Sea and the western Black Sea&#160;(Bauchot and Hureau 1986, 1990). This species occurs from the surface to 300 m depth (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999).","<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus</em> is an important commercial and food fish, and it is exploited&#160;in European waters by recreational and commercial fishers during its breeding season (Collin and Mallinson 2012).&#160;This species is fished throughout its range, particularly to the north of Senegal, where it is caught on line gear, with pelagic and bottom trawls, beach seines, fixed nets and traps&#160;(Cooper 2005, Collin and Mallinson 2012).&#160;<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus</em>&#160;is captured year round with significant seasonal differences in the landings (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999).&#160;Utilized fresh, frozen or dried salted, the flesh is highly esteemed; also reduced to fishmeal and oil (Carpenter in press). This species is regularly present in the markets of Tunisia, Morocco, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and Sicily, and is occasionally sold elsewhere.&#160;In Portugal, this species is commercially important in inshore waters with current annual landings of <em>c. </em>3,200 tonnes per year (Gonçlaves 1999, DGPA 2008).",Marine,"In the Canary Islands, there is a minimum size limit has been implemented for&#160;<em>Spondyliosoma cantharus</em>. In the case of the this species, the minimum size regulation is of limited benefit because the minimum length which may be legally kept is smaller than the length at first maturity (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1999).&#160;In European waters, there is no minimum landing size, total allowable catch and it is not subject to ICES stock assessment; however, the European Union places restrictions on any towed gears used for sea breams of a mesh size of &gt; 80 mm, and that the bream must comprise at least 70% of the catch (EU 1998, Collin and Mallinson 2012). It is recommended that measures be taken to protect nesting areas during the spawning season (Collin and Mallinson 2012).&#160;This species occurs in some marine protected areas within its range (World Database on Protected Areas, accessed 11 March 2014).","",,false,false,Global

Reflecting results in Colborn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2001), the geographic range of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. glossodonta</span> is likely representative of multiple species. Data on population decline are available from only a few locations, despite the expansive geographic range. In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and   modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6%   of the total catch; in 1992, they comprised only 7.5% of the total catch. This decline (37.1% in 15 years) was a result of overfishing, as opposed to a change in fishing method and effort (Beets 2000). Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). In Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, recent studies have demonstrated significant declines in abundance and average size of bonefish in the catch between 1977 and the late 1990s. Given fisheries characteristics throughout the region, we expect that in areas where bonefish are exposed to fishing effort that Tarawa serves as an example of what would likely occur in other areas throughout its range.&#160; In addition, although data on population decline is limited, this species may be closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Valiela <em>et al.</em>(2001) estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year.&#160; Using this estimate, mangroves have declined  global by an estimated 27% over the last three generation lengths for <em>A. glossodonta </em>(13.5  years).&#160; Much of this species' distribution lies in the Indo-Pacific,  where up to 14% of mangrove species are listed as threatened  (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) in some places  (Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160; The Indo-Malay Philippine Archipelago  is of particular concern, as it has one of the highest rates of mangrove  loss globally, with an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since  1980 (FAO 2007).&#160; In the tropical Indo-Pacific, 12% of all seagrasses  are currently threatened, and 20% of all seagrass species are  experiencing declines.&#160; In the temperate North Pacific, the  northern-most part of <em>A. glossodonta</em>'s range, 22% of all seagrass  species are threatened, and 44% are experiencing population declines  (Short <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Given the&#160; declines in these habitats,   we infer that the extreme habitat loss in parts of its   Pacific  range  will have similar negative consequences for population    trajectories. In addition, the recreational fishery is not well-established in the Indo-Pacific region, so there is little economic incentive for conservation; we do not expect conservation to be occurring at present. Therefore, we estimate global decline to equal or exceed 30% over three generation lengths in the past (13.5 years), with some substantially greater localized depletions in parts of the Indo-Pacific. Perhaps the greatest hindrances to the global conservation of this species are uncertainties about population connectivity and taxonomic resolution.

Crustaceans comprised more than 50% of the diet in a Hawaiian study (Friedlander 1997).<br/><br/>Natural mortality from sharks is very high at Palmyra Atoll (Adams pers. comm. 2011). The maximum size for this species is 90 cm (SL) (Myers 1991).","Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have decreased dramatically  over the past few decades, presumably because of overfishing and loss of  habitat, from over 300,000lbs in 1900 to less than 3,000lbs.  since 2002. Bonefish were the most important species in the commercial seine  fishery between 1966 and 1970, with average annual yields of nearly  18,000 pounds. Although the presence of multiple species within the  fishery makes species-specific declines hard to pinpoint, the commercial  seine catch now averages only 581lbs per year, accounting for less  than 8% of the catch. Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have declined from over  136.4 mt in 1900 to only 1.2 mt in 2001. This figure, however, includes  all   bonefish species in Hawaii (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>Heavy fishing pressure and degradation of habitats at Tarawa and Kiritimati Atolls  have resulted in the loss of pre-spawning staging sites and spawning  migration routes, which may be responsible for the observed declines in  bonefish catches, average size, and sex ratios at these locations (Friedlander<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008). There are declines in CPUE, mean length and weight of fish and also a change in sex ratio (Beets 2000). Sex ratio (F:M) was 0.71:1 in 1977 and in 1992–1993 it was recorded as 0.15:1. In 1977, mean length was 46.4 cm and mean weight was 1.3 kg. In 1992, mean length recorded was 37.6 cm and mean weight was 0.84 kg. There was a decrease in the smallest size of sexually mature individuals between the two time periods: in 1977 the smallest size of sexually mature males was 42.5 cm&#160; and 46.5 cm for females; in 1992 is was 32 cm for males and 35 cm for females. In addition, Beets (2000) conservatively estimates that the 30% of total catch was non-reproductive. In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6% of the total catch; in 1992, they comprised only 7.5% of the total catch. Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). The effects of catch-and-release fishing on this species are unclear.<br/><br/>Unrestrained growth of human populations in the coastal zones has also  accelerated habitat destruction, water quality degradation, and  disruption of prey species dynamics. Fishing and habitat loss and degradation may pose the most significant threats to this species. Disruptions to shallow  coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses and mangroves due to climate  change may pose significant future threats to this species, particularly  in areas with accelerated rates of coastal development and  urbanization. <br/><br/>The limited range of this species may  also make it vulnerable to local threats, such as habitat loss  (Friedlander<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008). It has been noted that habitat alteration, fragmentation and loss may contribute to the  decline in abundance of this species in Tarawa (Beets 2000). Bonefish are closely associated with mangroves,seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Given the dramatic  declines in these habitats (Mumby <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004, Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2001, Polidoro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Orth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006, Short <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011), we infer that comparable regional declines are likely  throughout its range. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2001) estimates that mangroves have  decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year. Since bonefish rely upon habitats of  limited extent, they are especially susceptible to habitat loss and  degradation, particularly due to climatic and anthropogenic influences. These habitats are often fragmented in nature, exacerbating this  issue. As with other coastal species, fragmentation will likely have  direct and indirect negative impacts on bonefish.","As multiple species within the genus are morphologically  indistinguishable, there is limited species-specific information  available on population status. Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have declined from over 136.4  mt in 1900 to only 1.2 mt in 2001. This figure, however, includes all  bonefish species in Hawaii (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). A recreational fishing guide on Oahu indicated that although netting of  bonefish continues, it is not as prevalent as it once was (Adams pers.  comm. 2011). It is therefore unclear whether the decline in landings is due to a change in effort or a true change in population size. Capture of recruits (CPUE) of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula </span>spp. in Kahana, Hawaii was highest in 1999 and has declined by 79% since that time (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>This species is rare in Mauritius (Sato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<br/><br/>In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and  modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6%  of the total catch; in 1992, they were 7.5% of the total catch. This decline (37.1% in 15 years) was a result of overfishing, as opposed to a change in fishing method and effort (Beets 2000). Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). A survey from the Fisheries Division of Kiribati conducted in 1995 shows  that bonefish was the second-most common species caught, accounting for 7% of  total catch. Gill nets caught 82% of the bonefish, with handlines  providing the remainder (18%) of the catch (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). In Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, recent studies have demonstrated significant  declines in abundance and average size of bonefish in the catch between  1977 and the late 1990s. The annual take of bonefish from Tarawa Lagoon  is between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 fish per year, but no stock  assessment has been conducted (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). This species is probably the most abundant molluscivorous fish in the lagoon (Beets 2001). Comparison data from fished and protected locations at Palmyra Atoll   show significant differences in population characteristics which may   indicate that threats are expressed asymmetrically across its range   (Adams pers. comm. 2011).&#160; Given fisheries characteristics throughout the region, we expect that in  areas where bonefish are exposed to fishing effort that Tarawa serves  as an example of what would likely occur in other areas throughout its  range. In addition, the recreational fishery is not  well-established in the Indo-Pacific, so there is little economic incentive for  conservation.&#160; Therefore, we do  not expect conservation to be occurring at  present.<br/><br/>Like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span>, <em>A. glossodonta</em>&#160; may be  closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other   shallow  coastal habitats.

2310733,194303,Albula vulpes,Near Threatened,,2012,2011-03-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species occurs in the tropical and subtropical northwest Atlantic and is closely associated with mangroves, seagrasses and other  shallow coastal habitats. Given the dramatic declines in these habitats, we infer that  comparable regional declines are likely throughout its range.  Globally, the highest proportion of threatened mangrove species is found  along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et  al.</span> (2001) estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a  rate of 2% per year. Four of the 10 (40%) mangrove species present  along the Pacific coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia are listed  in one of the three threatened categories, and a fifth species, <span style=""font-style: italic;""> Rhizophora samoensis</span>, is listed as Near Threatened (Polidoro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2010). Global declines in seagrasses and coral reefs are also significant within this species' range. Therefore, we conservatively estimate habitat loss of at least 20% in the last 35  years (three generation lengths), and infer similar declines in the  population of <em>A. vulpes</em>.<br/><br/>Since bonefish rely upon habitats of limited extent, they are  especially susceptible to habitat loss and degradation, particularly due  to climatic and anthropogenic influences. These habitats are often  fragmented in nature, exacerbating this issue. As with other coastal  species, fragmentation will likely have direct and indirect negative  impacts on bonefish. This species exhibits high site fidelity, and is therefore especially vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. <em>Albula vulpes</em> is listed as Near Threatened, as it nearly meets the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A2c, and there are examples of localized Vulnerability in the Florida Keys, St. Croix (US Virgin Islands), Bermuda and the Yucatan Peninsula. Additional information about the direction and magnitude of regional population trends will warrant future attention.","Bonefish in the Bahamian Archipelago generally inhabit shallow, nearshore waters (Kaufman 2000). Studies on localized movements of bonefish suggest that adults utilize a range of nearshore habitats, including seagrass beds, mangroves, and even coral reefs (Colton and Alevizon, 1983, Cooke and Philipp 2004, Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). They are also found on sand flats, mud flats, marl flats, algae beds, and other shallow water habitats. They are both subtidal and intertidal. Articles in popular angling publications indicate that bonefish are also observed and often caught on sandy flats devoid of benthic vegetation (Layman and Silliman 2002, Layman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004, Nero and Sullivan-Sealey 2005). In the Florida Keys and Belize, 96% of juveniles caught along sandy beaches were <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula</span> sp. B and 4% were <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span> (Adams <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Similarly, collections by Snodgrass <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2010) in the Florida Keys and Bahamas were dominated by<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Albula</span> sp. B.&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>The predominant<span style=""font-style: italic;""> A. vulpes</span> juvenile habitats remain unknown (Adams <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). One hundred percent of juveniles and sub-adults captured along beaches north of Miami in the US have been identified as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula</span> sp. B.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Diet</span><br/>Several diet studies have been conducted on bonefish in the western Atlantic (e.g., Warmke and Erdman 1963, Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1998),  suggesting that bonefish feed predominately on benthic invertebrates  (bivalves and crabs) but occasionally on small fishes. However, given  the taxonomic confusion surrounding this genus, these studies may have  included multiple species of bonefish. There are size and location differences in diet (Adams pers. comm. 2011). In the Bahamas, specimens less than 16 inches primarily feed on polychaete worms and bivalves; individuals over 16 inches primarily feed on crustaceans (shrimps, crabs) and fishes. To some extent, diet reflects habitat.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Reproduction</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/>Albula vulpes</span> exhibits seasonal reproductive activity throughout its Caribbean range (from October through April) with most activity occurring in fall-winter and early spring months (Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Spawning is presumed to occur in deep water off the coral reef shelf edge, away from principal foraging grounds (Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1997). Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2011) used sonic tracking to demonstrate offshore migrations for spawning. They spawn primarily during the full moon phase but possibly at the new moon phase as well (Adams pers. comm. 2011). They gather in pre-spawning aggregations in protected areas near deeper water. Spawning occurs at night. Recent aging of large bonefish has revealed that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span> live to at least 20 years (Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). There is evidence that suggests that 20 years may be a conservative estimate of longevity. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Growth and Development</span><br/>Growth rates in the Florida Keys differ from those in the Caribbean by 2–3 times (growth rates are faster in the Keys). Age at maturity is 3.5 years (Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997). 50% maturity for male occurs at 418 mm, and at an age of 3.6 years. Females mature (50%) at 4.2 years and 488 mm (Florida Keys, Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997). The smallest sexually mature bonefish observed was 358 mm. In the Cayman Islands, a ripe female was found measuring 342 mm (Adams <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Growth is rapid until six years, when the growth rate slows (Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1996). There are sexually dimorphic patterns of growth. The largest size recorded for this species is 702 mm TL (Crabtreet <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>1996).&#160; <br/><br/>Genetic sampling shows that 98% of the recreational fishery throughout the Caribbean is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span>. There are two genetically identifiable co-occurring populations in the Caribbean and both populations are pan-Caribbean (Wallace unpublished data).<br/><br/>Tagging studies in the Florida Keys (Larkin unpublished data) and in the Caribbean (Adams pers comm. 2011) indicate that greater than 70% of recaptures are within five miles of tagging reefs. However, dart tagging and sonic tracking have revealed movements over 140 miles (Haley 2009). Long distance movements on Andros, Bahamas appear to be associated with spawning migrations. There were two bonefish tagged in the upper Florida Keys that were recaptured in Andros, Bahamas.<br/><br/>This species has leptocephali larvae. Mean larval duration is 41–71 days (Mojica<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span>  1995). They recruit in summer and winter, indicating prolonged  spawning. Recruitment occurs at night, with recruits present in the  upper meter of the water column (Mojica <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1995). Victor (pers. comm. 2011) found that the leptocephali larvae were positively photo-taxic.<br/><br/>Using  equation number five of section 4.4 of the Guidelines for Using  the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions  Working Group 2008), if generation length = age of first reproduction +  z*(length of the reproductive period), and age at first reproduction is  estimated at 3.5 years, z is estimated to be 0.5 based on survivorship  and relative fecundity with age, and the length of the reproductive  period is estimated at 16.5 years (20 years - 3.5 years = 16.5 years), then generation length for this species is estimated to  be 11.75 years.","This species is targeted by recreational fishermen in Florida (US) and throughout the Caribbean, including Cuba (Valdez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008) Belize (Pritchett 2008), Venezuela (Posada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008), and The Bahamian Archipelago (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<br/><br/>Although the use of bonefish as a subsistence food item has declined in recent  decades in The Bahamas (Rudd 2003), commercial gill nets have been employed in some  areas, resulting in excessive harvests of bonefish and substantial  bycatch of other species, including turtles, barracudas, dolphins and  sharks (Clark and Danylchuk 2003).<br/><br/>Effects of catch-and-release fishing on bonefish have been intensively studied (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2007, 2008), Cooke and Philipp (2004) and Suski <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (unpublished data). Handling time and handling behaviour by anglers, and the presence/absence of predators significantly effect post-release survival. Hook type and hook retention does not affect post-release survival. For bonefish held in live wells, flow-through ambient water is best for post-release survival. &#160; Post-release survival may be negatively correlated with high temperatures.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation are the most significant threats to this species. Unrestrained growth of human populations in the coastal zones has also accelerated habitat destruction, water quality degradation, and disruption of prey species dynamics. Disruptions to shallow coastal ecosystems due to climate change may pose significant future threats to this species, particularly in areas with accelerated rates of coastal development and urbanization.&#160; Increasing water temperatures may also exceed the thermal maximum of bonefishes (36.4–40.6°C) (Murchie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).<br/><br/>Bonefish are closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Given the dramatic declines in these habitats (Mumby <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004, Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2001, Polidoro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Orth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006, Short <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011), we infer that comparable regional declines are likely throughout its range. Globally, between 20% and 35% of mangrove area have been lost since approximately 1980, and mangrove areas are disappearing at the rate of approximately 1% per year (Valiela <em>et al. </em>2001, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2007).&#160; The highest proportion of threatened mangrove species is found along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America.

Bill Curtis, a legendary professional bonefish guide and a member of the 2012 class of IGFA Legendary Captains and Crew, estimated that by the early 2000s, the visible bonefish population had declined 90% compared to the late 1940s (Curtis 2004). Numerous long-time Florida Keys anglers corroborate the declines described by Curtis (2004); causes for the declines are unknown. In other locations where netting has occurred, populations have been eradicated or size distributions have been truncated (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Unit stock and stock sizes remain virtually unknown, and fishery impacts on the region are largely unknown and remain areas for future evaluation. A recent population census in the Florida Keys indicates that the population remained relatively constant from 2003–2005 (Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Connectivity and larval transport among subpopulations are not well understood, but genetic research indicates sufficient gene flow to support a single stock.<br/></p><p>Although it is recognized that this species is distributed throughout the Bahamas Archipelago, no formal studies have been conducted to determine their distribution and relative abundance across spatial or temporal scales (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).

Genetic surveys have detected it only in the Caribbean (Pfeiler 1996, Colborn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2001), Florida and the Bahamas. Thus, the species, once believed to be global in scope (Briggs 1960, Alexander 1961), now has one of the most restricted distributions among bonefishes (Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). No type locality exists, but Eschmeyer (1998) suggests that the type location may have been the Bahamas. Larvae have been collected as far north as Rhode Island.","This species is targeted by recreational fishermen throughout the Caribbean, including Cuba (Valdez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008) Belize (Pritchett 2008), Venezuela (Posada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008), and The Bahamian Archipelago (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). An economically important recreational fishery is also present in the state of Florida, USA, where the overall economic impact of recreational fisheries greatly surpasses the current commercial fishery revenues (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission   2005). Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2008) estimated the value of a bonefish in the Florida Keys at $75,000 per individual over the lifetime of the fish; however, this estimate may differ from that of a new study on the economic value of the flats fishery in the Florida Keys (bonefish, tarpon, permit) (Adams pers. comm. 2011).<br/> <br/> In the Bahamas, the total economic value of the recreational bonefish fishery is greater than $140 million annually (Fedler 2010). In Belize, the flats fishery (bonefish, tarpon and permit) exceeded $25 million annually (Fedler 2008). There is no evidence of international trade;&#160; all consumption and sale appears to be local (Adams pers. comm. 2011).<br/><br/>For generations, bonefish have been the focus of subsistence and artisanal fisheries throughout the Caribbean (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Subsistence and small-scale commercial harvesting in this area was traditionally conducted in relatively shallow waters using handline, seine nets and gill nets (Olsen 1986). Use of bonefish as a subsistence food item has declined in recent decades (Rudd 2003), and commercial gill nets have been employed in some areas of the Turks and Caicos, resulting in excessive harvests of bonefish and substantial bycatch of other species, including turtles, barracudas, dolphins and sharks (Clark and Danylchuk 2003). Gill nets are also utilized in the Bahamas, Belize, and Cuba (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Gill nets were responsible for eradicating the bonefish population in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Bonefish&#160; have gained importance as a target species for specialized recreational anglers in many locations in the Caribbean (sensu Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). The use of gill nets to target bonefish and other near-shore species is becoming more common in the Bahamas and Belize (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Angling for bonefish has become extremely popular, as their powerful swimming abilities when hooked make them a challenge to catch using lightweight fly-fishing and conventional hook and line gears (Kaufman 2000, Davidson 2004, Fernandez 2004).<br/><br/>Artisinal fishers in Venezuela historically targeted <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span>, although the use of seine nets was banned in the 1980s. Since then, bonefish are only caught occasionally by artisinal fishers using small pocket nets (Posada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008).<br/><br/>In various regions (Bahamas, Belize, wider Caribbean Sea), bonefish are often used as bait for catching large pelagic or reef fishes (marlin, grouper, etc.) (Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).",Marine|Marine,"Despite their ecological and economic importance, fishery regulations for bonefish across the Bahamian Archipelago are limited (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). In the Bahamas, the capture of bonefish using nets and the commercial trade of bonefish are prohibited (Bahamas Department of Fisheries 1986). In the Turks and Caicos Islands,&#160; there are no specific regulations (Turks and Caicos Islands Government 1998). In an effort to conserve fish stocks and their habitats, both countries are using marine protected areas in conjunction with existing fisheries regulations to build sustainable fisheries and protect marine biodiversity.&#160; Catch-and-release is commonly practised by recreational anglers with a strong conservation ethic who travel to the region. Research is needed to identify whether unique bonefish stocks occur in the Bahamian Archipelago, since stock mixing could significantly complicate management of the species (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). In Belize and Puerto Rico, bonefish are catch-and release-only. In Florida, this species became catch-and-release only in 2011 (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission). Enforcement is lacking throughout this species' range.<br/><br/>Rising exploitation pressures, rapid human development within this  species' range, and environmental changes in coastal waters suggest that  new information on population dynamics and resource ecology is  critically needed to support fishery management strategies to conserve  this species (Ault<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008).<br/><br/>This species is found in numerous Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)  throughout its range.

2316114,194341,Ocyurus chrysurus,Data Deficient,,2016,2015-10-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Ocyurus chrysurus</em> is widely distributed and abundant in the tropical and subtropical portions of its range. Adults can be very abundant in reef areas and it is fished throughout its range. Based on stock assessments, this species is not considered to be overfished in US waters. However, it is considered overfished in Cuba and in Brazil. In Cuba, landings declined more than 50% since 1995. Brazil has the largest landings of this species worldwide, a trend that began in the 1980s. There is modelling evidence of at least a 30% reduction of this species in regions of Brazil due to overfishing. However there do not appear to be time series on landings or biomass at a scale of three generation lengths (33-36 years) for this species outside of the US and Cuba. Based on the absence of landings data in major regions of the species range and the apparent long term stability of the stocks in many areas, this species is currently listed as Data Deficient. It is strongly recommended that multi-year monitoring be conducted particularly in areas subject to overfishing. Long term monitoring of highly fished areas will help future efforts to assess the species with data that fulfil IUCN criteria.","This reef-associated species inhabits clear coastal waters, mostly around hardbottom and coral reefs. It usually occurs above the bottom, and frequently in aggregations. Young individuals are found in shallow vegetation and on shallow hardbottom. With growth, individuals move to shallow coral reef areas (Nagelkerken <em>et al</em>. 2000). The juvenile usage of several backreef habitats in comparison to congeners is reviewed in Nagelkerken (2009). Acoustic tracking of five individuals of <em>O. chrysurus</em> near no-take marine reserves in the Dry Tortugas, Florida, estimated an average home range of about 4.17 km<sup>2</sup> (Farmer and Ault 2011). This species feeds on a combination of plankton and benthic animals including crustaceans, worms and gastropods.&#160;<br/><br/>Spawning can occur throughout the year, with peaks at different times in different areas (Smith 1997). In Cuban waters, peak spawning is during April; another less intensive peak occurs in September (Claro<em> et al</em>. 2001). On the Abrolhos Bank off Brazil, this species spawns twice a year, with a peak between September and October and another between February and March (Freitas<em> et al.</em> 2011). <br/><br/>Longevity for this species has been estimated to be 13 to 17 years in the US Atlantic (SERO 2011) and Gulf of Mexico (SERO 2010), and between six and 17 years in the Caribbean (Piedra 1969, Claro 1983, Manooch and Drennon 1987), with an estimated generation length of 11-12 years. Longevity was estimated to be 17-19 years in Brazil (Araújo <em>et al</em>. 2002, Diedhiou <em>et al.</em> 2004). Females can reach 50% maturity at 20.9 cm (TL), or at an average age of 1.7 years (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Cuba, Claro <em>et al</em>. (2001) report a mean size at maturity for this species to be 30.8 cm TL and two years of age. Trejo-Martínez <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated maturity at 26.1 cm TL for this species from the Campeche Bank. Maximum length is 81 cm (Anderson 2002).","This species is caught by recreational anglers and commercial fishers primarily by hook-and-line, although other gears such as spears, gill nets, cast nets and fish traps are also used. It commonly forms large schools in the water column. This species has been the number one reef fish export from Brazil since the 1960s and is considered overfished (Cunha <em>et al.</em> 2012; additional citations in the Population section).&#160;Juveniles utilize both vegetated and nearshore hardbottom areas than may be threatened by coastal development. Burial of nearshore hardbottom habitats by coastal dredge and fill projects can eliminate settlement habitat used by Yellowtail Snapper and other lutjanids in southeast Florida (Lindeman and Snyder 1999). Adults of this species are associated with corals and a variety of direct and indirect threats may arise with increasing climate change impacts on corals and associated habitats (Ateweberhan <em>et al</em>. 2013).","In the US, this species primarily occurs in Florida and is fished recreationally and commercially. Commercial landings for the years 1985-2010 show it was mostly targeted off South Florida. Landings increased through the 1980s and early 1990s, then experienced a decline from the mid 1990s until 2008-2013 when landings increased again (NMFS 2015). A stock assessment in 2003 indicated that estimated total biomass and spawning stock biomass in the southeast US had been relatively stable over the prior 20 years (1981-2001) (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2003). The age structure and growth off southern Florida had changed little in two decades of heavy fishing (Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2003). There is evidence that stock and spawning biomass has been increasing off Florida since 2001, the number of older fish has been increasing, and fishing mortality rate has generally been declining with a slight upturn in recent years (O'Hop<em> et al.</em> 2012). Considering these factors, the 2003 and subsequent 2012 stock assessment concluded that this species is not overfished in the southeast US, nor currently experiencing overfishing (O'Hop <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Off Cuba, it is considered to be common and is an important fishery resource. Over a period of approximately 15-20 years, landings for this species in Cuba declined by over 50% (Claro and Lindeman 2008). In the early 1960s, catch and effort increased due to the introduction of bottom trawls and an increase in trap numbers. After 1987, catches declined partly due to the high mortality of juveniles taken in trawls. The majority of the catch occurred in Archipelago Jardines de la Reina and the Gulf of Batabano. Decreases in trawler size in the past allowed for more efficient release of juveniles from nets, but it is not yet clear if this has been effective. Specific spawning aggregation sites are not clearly located; however, there is evidence that pre-spawning individuals were targeted by the fishery during migration to spawning sites (Claro<em> et al</em>. 2009). Ocean circulation modelling suggests limited larval connectivity between Cuba and US waters (Paris <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>This species is caught as bycatch in the commercial fisheries for <em>Lutjanus campechanus</em> (Red Snapper) off Mexico. As catch of <em>L. campechanus</em> has been declining, exploitation of species such as <em>L. synagris </em>(Lane Snapper) and <em>O. chrysurus</em> has been increasing (SAGARPA 2012). Commercial and artisanal fisheries for Yellowtail Snapper occurs throughout the tropical, western Atlantic and average landings from the Caribbean for 1997-2000 have been 3,458 mt (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160;In the Caribbean, Mexico is the highest producer of&#160;Yellowtail Snapper&#160;with average landings of 1,413 mt per year (1997-2000), followed by the US with an average of 747 mt per year, and Cuba with an average of 498 mt (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species is subject to high fishing pressure in Columbia and Venezuela (Acero and Garzon 1985, Cervigon <em>et al</em>. 1992).<br/><br/>Brazil is the main exporter of this species worldwide (Martins <em>et al.</em> 2005). The population of this species off Brazil is considered to be genetically separate from the Caribbean (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is one of the most fished species of snappers in Brazil (Begossi <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Abrolhos region from 2001-2005, this species represented 3.1% of estimated total biomass (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008a), and is considered second in the rank of catch in biomass after <em>L. analis</em> in northeastern Brazil (Begossi <em>et al.</em> 2012). A study of this species in northeastern Brazil from 1998-2000 found a decline in mean abundance indexes, which was likely caused by the increasing effort targeting this species (Nobrega <em>et al</em>. 2009). In northeast Brazil, a virtual population analyses based on a short-data series estimated that this species was overexploited by the hand-line fishery, and a higher yield per recruit would be obtained by a 43% reduction in effort (Gomes de Mattos and Maynou 2009). Stock assessments in the central coast of Brazil (Klippel <em>et al</em>. 2005) indicate that <em>O. chrysurus</em> has been severely overfished. Freitas <em>et al</em>. (2011) suggest that exploitation also occurs in spawning areas. There is not time series information at a scale close to three generation lengths for this species (see Habitat and Ecology section).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from Massachusetts south along the U.S. coast, Bermuda, the Bahamas, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and along the South American coast to Sao Paulo, Brazil.

The roles of enhanced use of local ecological knowledge in the management of this and other snappers is discussed in Begossi <em>et al</em>. (2012). At marine protected areas in the Abrolhos reef system of eastern Brazil, evidence of spillover (i.e. higher biomass inside the reserve and in unprotected sites closer to the boundary) was marginally significant for <em>O. chrysurus</em> (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008b).","",,false,false,Global

2780499,21981,Tomistoma schlegelii,Vulnerable,A2cd,2014,2011-12-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p>  This species qualifies as Vulnerable as global populations have been reduced, almost certainly by over 30% in the past 75 years / three generations (assuming a generation time of 25 years), principally due to continuing loss and fragmentation of swamp forest over the past three to four decades. <em>Tomistoma schlegelii </em>persists over a wide range (confirmed localities in Borneo, Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia), but many documented populations are small, fragmented, and under threat from habitat loss. The largest remaining–and most secure–subpopulations may be in East and Central Kalimantan, which support thousands of square kilometres of degraded but largely undeveloped wetlands. Given this, it appears unlikely that &lt;2,500 mature individuals remain globally (the IUCN definition for Endangered), as a relatively small number of sites with small subpopulations (e.g. 50 sites each with 50 individuals or 100 sites each with 25 individuals) is required to meet this criterion. The previous IUCN Red List status (vers. 2.3) for this species was Endangered (Crocodile Specialist Group 2000): the current downgrade in global status to Vulnerable does not imply an increase in the global population/range or a reduction in threats, but a more accurate assessment than was previously possible. Nonetheless, it remains possible that <em>T. schlegelii</em> qualifies as globally Endangered, due to ongoing habitat loss and degradation. At the national and/or site level, this is almost certainly the case for some range states, particularly Malaysia.   <em>T. schlegelii</em> was accorded the IUCN Red List status of ‘Endangered’ in 1998 at an expert workshop during the 14<sup>th</sup> Working Meeting of the IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group. Since that time, new survey data for sites in Kalimantan, Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia have become available, enabling a more accurate assessment of global threat status. The global status of <em>T. schlegelii </em>is reassessed to be Vulnerable. This is largely based on inferences about habitat loss, rather than documented changes in abundance, because little quantitative data is available for the species. Most surveys have recorded low densities of individuals. Documented examples of population decline include a site in Sumatra, where an increase in logging and burning coincided with a decline in <em>T. schlegelii</em> densities over a seven-year period (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2002), and a park in Kalimantan, where <em>T. schlegelii</em> densities were higher in intact swamp forest than nearby degraded areas (Simpson 2004, Auliya <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species is cryptic and difficult to detect, and rapid assessments may under-record or fail to detect the species, leading to inaccurate conclusions of status. In some parts of Kalimantan, <em>T. schlegelii</em> appears to maintain reasonable levels of abundance even after many cycles of logging and burning in peat/freshwater swamps; in other areas, surveys and local information clearly indicate the species has declined. The principal threat to <em>T. schlegelii</em> is severe and continuing loss of swamp forest, mainly due to logging, fire, drainage, and plantation development. Other threats include entanglement in fishing gear, low-level opportunistic removal of <em>T. schlegelii</em> from the wild, usually by residents and crocodile farmers, who keep juveniles or eggs as items of curiosity, and potentially climate change, which may result in large-scale modification of nesting habitats. Many river systems remain unsurveyed for <em>T. schlegelii</em> and it remains one of the least known crocodilians.<em> <br/></em></p><p>&#160;</p><p></p><p>Reasons for Change  A downgrade in IUCN Red List status from Endangered to Vulnerable is warranted because surveys indicate the species persists over a wide global range. It has clearly declined in many areas and ongoing habitat loss suggests these declines are continuing.   </p>","<p><em>Tomistoma schlegelii</em> is a freshwater, mound-nesting species. It is among the largest of the extant crocodilians, with males attaining lengths up to 5+ m (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2004; authors pers. obs.). It is restricted primarily to lowland swamps, lakes and rivers. Most records are from peat swamp and freshwater swamp forest (Stuebing <em>et al</em>. 2006), which historically encompassed most of the lowlands of Borneo, eastern Sumatra, and Peninsular Malaysia. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The ecology of <em>T. schlegelii</em>, including nesting, size and age of sexual maturity, diet, and population demography, remains poorly known. Fewer than 20 wild nests have been documented. Most nests in Sumatra and Kalimantan have been located at the base of large trees in mature peat swamp forest, along remote tributaries (Endert 1927, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Staniewicz 2011). In Sarawak, a nest was located in degraded forest at the edge of cultivated land (Lading and Stuebing 1997). Nests have been reported from floating vegetation mats (Ross <em>et al</em>. 1998). Nesting occurs in the dry season and small clutches (13-41 eggs) are laid (Endert 1927, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2001). Hatchlings emerge in the late dry season / early wet season after an estimated 70-80 days incubation (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 1997). <em>Tomistoma schlegelii </em>produces the largest eggs of all living crocodilians (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 1998). Sexual maturity in females appears to be attained at around 2.5-3 m total length and 20 years age (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 1998, Shwedick 2006, Brazaitis and Abene 2008; B. Ziegler [Miami Metro Zoo, USA] pers. comm. to J.P. Ross 1995; U. Youngprapakorn [Utairatch Crocodile Farm &amp; Zoo, Thailand]) pers. comm. to authors 2008), a relatively large size and late age compared with other crocodilians.</p>  <p><em>&#160;</em></p>  <p>Müller (1838) stated the diet of <em>T. schlegelii</em> comprised fish, monitor lizards (<em>Varanus</em>), waterbirds and mammals. Predation of monkeys by <em>T. schlegelii </em>has been observed (Galdikas and Yeager 1984, Galdikas 1985, Yeager 1991). Stomach contents of juvenile wild <em>T. schleglii</em> included shrimp (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 1998) and other invertebrates (Staniewicz and Behler 2010).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Other scientific studies of <em>T. schlegelii </em>have included assessment of its taxonomic status (see Taxonomic Notes), anatomy and skin qualities (e.g. Boulenger 1896, King and Brazaitis 1971, Brazaitis 1973, Fuchs 2006), potential impacts of climate change (Bickford <em>et al</em>. 2010), conservation effectiveness of protected area networks (Rödder <em>et al</em>. 2010), and captive breeding and management (see Conservation Measures).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","<p>Severe and continuing loss of swamp forest habitat throughout the global range of <em>T. schlegelii </em>is the key threat to most wild populations. Loss and fragmentation of swamp forest has been occurring for over three decades throughout Southeast Asia due to large-scale commercial and illegal logging, plantation development (especially the establishment of paper pulp mills and palm oil plantations), forest fires, and deliberate swamp drainage through construction of channels and dykes. Large areas of swamp forest in East, Central and West Kalimantan were destroyed or severely degraded by the El Niño-induced drought of 1997 and 1998 (Stibig <em>et al</em>. 2007). The expansion of oil palm plantations is currently the main driver of loss of swamp forest in Sumatra and Borneo (Stibig <em>et al</em>. 2007). Based on satellite imagery from 2000, almost 45% (&gt;one million hectares) of peat swamp in Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand has been converted to various land uses, and over a million hectares has been converted in Borneo and Sumatra (Yoshino <em>et al</em>. 2010). Across the global range of <em>T. schlegelii</em>,<em> </em>Borneo retains the largest area of peat swamp under natural cover (70-90%), but which is of varying quality and much is degraded (Yoshino <em>et al</em>. 2010). At least in Sumatra, a significant threat appears to be predation of <em>T. schlegelii </em>eggs by the introduced wild pig <em>Sus scrofa</em>; four of seven <em>T. schlegelii</em> nests recorded along one river were predated by this species (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 1997). A smaller but potentially significant threat is opportunistic removal of <em>T. schlegelii</em> and eggs from the wild, usually by residents and crocodile farmers (see Use and Trade). Commercial hunting of <em>T. schlegelii </em>occurred in some regions from the 1950s-1970s and probably contributed to the decline of the species, but no longer occurs. Individuals sometimes drown in fishing nets. In areas with depressed and threatened populations, the continuing low-level removal of mature individuals (e.g. from drowning or capture in fishing gear) may cause disproportionately large impacts; this may be the case along some rivers in southern Sumatra (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2001). Fishing appears to be less of a threat in East Kalimantan (Indonesia) and possibly Sarawak (Malaysia), where fishermen apparently release <em>T. schlegelii</em> caught in fishing gear due to local beliefs that harming the species will bring bad luck or illness (RBS pers. obs.). &#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","<p>No global or national population estimates are available for <em>T. schlegelii</em>. Spotlight densities are the only indices of abundance available for this species and have been documented in relatively few sites. Extrapolation of these densities to larger areas may be unreliable, because densities along rivers or creeks (where most surveys have occurred) may be highly different from swamp forest habitats. This issue is confounded by varying detectability (greater along waterways than within swamp forest). The highest recorded density of <em>T. schlegelii </em>is 1.4-2.6 individuals/km, along a well-protected short (&lt;4 km) river section at the headquarters of Tanjung Puting National Park, Central Kalimantan Province (Simpson 2004, Auliya <em>et al</em>. 2006). This density is apparently atypical for the park: in areas of the park further from the headquarters, habitats are more disturbed and <em>T. schlegelii</em> densities are much lower (Auliya <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Danau Sentarum  National Park (West Kalimantan  Province), spotlight densities at a site ranged from 0.21 individuals/km in 1994 (Frazier 1994) to 0.08 individuals/km in 2004 (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2004), and 0.02-0.07 individuals/km at other sites (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Simpson and Mediyansyah 2009). At Mesangat  Lake (East Kalimantan  Province), <em>T. schlegelii </em>is locally abundant; in 2012, densities ranged from 0.2-1.6 individuals/km in flooded forest and open water habitats (Staniewicz 2011). In Sumatra, the highest recorded spotlight densities of <em>T. schlegelii </em>are 0.18 and 0.26 individuals/km, at two sites in South Sumatra and Jambi Provinces respectively (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2002). </p><p><br/></p>  <p><em>Tomistoma schlegelii</em> is a cryptic species and swamp forest habitats are difficult to access: many surveys may have under-recorded or not detected its presence. Compared with spotlight densities for some other crocodilians, which may reach densities of tens or hundreds of individuals per kilometre, all recorded densities of <em>T. schlegelii </em>are low. Repeat spotlight counts at two sites in Sumatra indicate that densities declined over a seven-year period, which coincided with intensive logging and burning in these sites (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2002).</p><p><br/></p>  <p>Few other methods to estimate abundance have been applied to <em>T. schlegelii</em>.<em> </em>A mark-recapture study was conducted from 2010-2011 at Mesangat  Lake (East Kalimantan Province, Indonesia) but few individuals have been recaptured (Staniewicz 2011). Nest census methods have not been applied to <em>T. schlegelii</em> because nests are located in swamp forest and are highly cryptic.</p><p><br/></p>  <p>There is presently insufficient data to estimate the global population of <em>T. schlegelii</em>. Criterion C of the IUCN Red List defines the difference between ‘Endangered’ and ‘Vulnerable’ as the global number of mature individuals to be fewer than 2,500 or 10,000 respectively (IUCN 2001). Whether or not there are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals is unknown. Conversely, there is higher confidence in concluding there are more than 2,500 mature individuals. To achieve a minimum global number of 2,500 mature individuals, a relatively small number of sites with small subpopulations is required e.g. 50 sites each with 50 individuals or 100 sites each with 25 individuals. Given the large extent of swamp forest habitat remaining across the global range of the species (over 13 million hectares of peat swamp in Sumatra, Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia; Yoshino <em>et al</em>. 2010), this seems reasonable. </p>  <p><br/></p><p>This generalized conclusion of global status clearly does not reflect trends for all individual range states. East and Central Kalimantan Provinces, which support large tracts of degraded swamp forest, may support the largest remaining populations of <em>T. schlegelii</em>, although surveys are required to confirm this. In at least one site in East Kalimantan  Province, Mesangat, preliminary data indicates <em>T. schlegelii</em> persist in relatively degraded swamp forest habitats (Staniewicz 2011). If this is the case elsewhere in East and Central  Kalimantan Provinces, the remaining numbers of mature individuals in these provinces may be relatively high. In contrast, survey data from sites in West Kalimantan  Province and Sumatra suggest that logging, burning and other human pressures have resulted in reduced <em>T. schlegelii </em>densities. In Peninsular Malaysia, severe and continuing clearance of remnant swamp forest, high human populations, and high levels of economic development, suggest that localized declines or even extirpation may be occurring (see Threats). In Brunei, any remnant breeding populations are probably small, given the small size of the nation and limited extent of swamp forest habitat.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Tomistoma schlegelii </em>historically occurred over parts of Indonesia (Müller 1838, Weber 1890, de Rooij 1915), Malaysia (Boulenger 1896, Annandale and Robinson 1904, Smith 1930) and possibly Thailand (Taylor 1970). Unconfirmed reports are from Sabah (Borneo) and Viet Nam but are vague and inconclusive (Stuebing <em>et al</em>. 2006). The current distribution of <em>T. schlegelii </em>extends over lowland regions of eastern Sumatra, Kalimantan and western Java (Indonesia), and Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia (Malaysia), within five degrees north and south of the equator (Stuebing <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species was recently confirmed to occur in Brunei Darussalam. The largest extant populations are in Kalimantan and Sumatra. Most documented populations are diminished and fragmented. Previous reviews of global distribution are by Sebastian (1994) and Stuebing <em>et al</em>. (2006). Summaries of national distribution are as follows. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Brunei Darussalam: Few crocodile surveys conducted to date (e.g. Das and Charles 2000, Cox 2006) and possibly none targeting inland swamp forests, where <em>T. schlegelii </em>are most likely to occur. A crocodile photographed by an expatriate resident in 2005 at Tutong  River was confirmed by RBS (from examination of the photograph) to be a <em>T. schlegelii</em> (Stuebing <em>et al</em>. 2006). There is no reason to suggest this was a released individual and it is the first confirmed national record.<em></em></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Indonesia: </p>  <p>Java – status unclear. Koningsberger (1913: 376) noted (in translation) ‘whether, apart from <em>C. porosus</em>, <em>T. schlegelii</em> also occurs in Java, is a question that cannot be answered with certainty..’. Meer Mohr (1921) noted (in translation) ‘according to Strauch, <em>T. schlegelii</em> occurs in Java…the only specimen from Java is in the museum in Stuttgart [Germany]...the origin of this specimen is uncertain...further work is required to clarify the status of <em>T. schlegelii</em>&#160; in Java..’. More recently, unconfirmed local reports of <em>T. schlegelii </em>have been obtained from one site, Ujung  Kulon National   Park (Auliya 2002). The most detailed account of crocodiles for this park is by Hoogerwerf (1970), who does not mention the species. Given the small size of the park and modified nature of surrounding lands, any populations are presumably small. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Kalimantan – confirmed records are from Tanjung Puting National Park (Central Kalimantan Province; e.g. Galdikas and Yeager 1984, Galdikas 1985, Simpson 2004, Auliya <em>et al</em>. 2006), the Mahakam and Belayan river systems and Mesangat Lake (East Kalimantan Province; Endert 1927, Meijard and Sozer 1996, Ross <em>et al</em>. 1998, Staniewicz 2011) and upper Kapuas river area, Danau Sentarum and Gunung Palung National Parks (West Kalimantan Province; Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2004 and references therein; Simpson and Mediyansyah 2009); no conﬁrmed wild records from South Kalimantan Province. The species is likely to persist in many other locations in Kalimantan, and the limited number of confirmed localities probably reflects low sampling effort.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Sumatra – all known records are from eastern Sumatra, east of the Barisan Mountain Ranges (Bezuijen <em>et al.</em> 1998). Scattered populations persist from North Sumatra to South Sumatra Provinces, with an isolated population in Way Kambas National Park (Lampung Province). The range of <em>T. schlegelii </em>in Sumatra has declined by at least 30% since the 1950s due to hunting and habitat loss (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 1998).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Malaysia: Small populations persist in Peninsular Malaysia and presumably Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo; historical localities include Batang Lupar, Simunjan, and Ensengai). Peninsular Malaysia – confirmed localities are in the Perak and Pahang Rivers, Selangor swamp and Tesak Bera Ramsar Site, all in the western portion of the peninsula (Stuebing <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006; Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hatchling <em>T. schlegelii </em>observed at a wildlife trader’s facility in 1997 were reported to be wild-caught, suggesting breeding persists in the peninsula (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Remnant populations are almost certainly under severe threat given extensive and continuing loss of lowland swamps and high human densities of this region (authors pers. obs.). Sarawak – status unclear; reported (but largely unconfirmed) from Kuching, Bintulu and Miri Divisions. Sabah – unconfirmed local reports; no other information available (Stuebing <em>et al.</em> 2006). <br/> <br/> </p>  <p>Thailand: Status unclear. Reported to have occurred (e.g. Smith 1916, Taylor 1970) but records vague and inconclusive. No reports since at least the 1970s; previous authors have postulated the species may be extirpated (Humphrey and Bain 1990, Ratanakorn&#160;1994) or that historical records may have referred to localities in northern Peninsular Malaysia (Stuebing <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Viet Nam: Status unclear. A wild crocodile captured in 1967 was reported to be this species (Mucelli 2005). Given the severe threats facing two confirmed crocodile species in Viet Nam, <em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> and <em>C. porosus</em>, it seems likely that even if <em>T. schlegelii</em> was historically present, it has been extirpated.<strong></strong></p><p>&#160;</p>","<p><span class=""datalabel"">Small-scale opportunistic collection of wild individuals and eggs occurs in some regions, for sale to crocodile farms and/or consumption.

In contrast, hunters in East Kalimantan state the species has no commercial value and was not hunted. Commercial skin trade no longer occurs. <em>Tomistoma schlegeli</em>i is not a commercially valuable species due to the presence of osteoderms in the belly scales (farmers in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Malaysia pers. comm. to authors; Fuchs 2006). Low-level but ongoing removal of <em>T. schlegelii</em> from the wild continues. In Sumatra, wild juvenile <em>T. schlegelii</em> at a crocodile farm in 2002 had been purchased from local fishermen, and staff reported that the farm continues to purchase <em>T. schlegelii</em> on an opportunistic basis (MRB unpubl. data). In 1997, juvenile <em>T. schlegelii</em> observed at the facility of a wildlife trader on Penang  Island, Peninsular Malaysia, were reported to be wild-caught (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2012).

Reviews of national or global distribution (Sebastian 1994; Stuebing <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006) have been prepared. The first dedicated research project on the species was conducted from 1995-1997 and resulted in a status assessment for Sumatra as well as new data on the ecology of <em>T. schlegelii </em>(Bezuijen<em> et al</em>. 1998, 2001). In 2001-2002, largely through the voluntary efforts of MRB and G.J.W. Webb, repeat-surveys were conducted at two sites in Sumatra, and the ﬁrst Indonesian workshop on <em>T. schlegelii</em> was held (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2002). Sumatran agencies and NGOs subsequently conducted additional surveys which resulted in the discovery of a new nesting site and protection of swamp forest (Bezuijen 2004). These various efforts have resulted in new information on the distribution, status, breeding biology and of ecology of <em>T. schlegelii</em>.</p><p><br/> <br/> In 2003, the IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group (CSG) formed the Tomistoma Task Force (TTF), a group of CSG members who coordinate the CSG’s efforts for <em>T. schlegelii</em> conservation. TTF activities comprise fundraising for ﬁeld research, international awareness-raising, and hosting of a TTF website. Fund-raising events have been held in North America and Europe, largely due to the voluntary efforts of BS, R. Sommerlad and other CSG members. Two <em>T. schlegelii </em>student projects have been co-funded and are the first detailed autecological studies of the species. TTF reports have been prepared on global conservation priorities (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2003) and husbandry standards for captive breeding of <em>T. schlegelii </em>(Shwedick and Sommerlad 2000, Shwedick 2006). In 2008, a TTF workshop was held and a re-assessment of global conservation priorities was undertaken. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Other initiatives include the following. In 2009, a foundation, Yayasan Ulin, was established in East Kalimantan by RBS to promote wetland and crocodile conservation. This has resulted in co-management agreements with a plantation company to conserve crocodile habitats, support for two international internships studying <em>T. schlegelii </em>and <em>Crocodylus siamensis</em>,<em> </em>and the identification of wetland sites important for biodiversity conservation (Yayasan Ulin 2012). In West Kalimantan, the People, Resources, and Conservation Foundation (PRCF) is planning <em>T. schlegelii</em> conservation activities in Danau Sentarum National Park, to build on surveys in 2004 (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the nearby Lake Siawan-Belida area, Fauna &amp; Flora International are developing an ecosystem restoration project to manage the swamp forest, including <em>T. schlegelii </em>(Simpson and Mediyansyah 2009)<em>.</em> In Sumatra, the non-government organization Wahana Bumi Hijau is implementing a project ‘Protection of the Senyulong crocodile habitat in the Merang-Kepayang peat swamp forest’ [south-east Sumatra]. In 2009 the project received technical assistance from IUCN Netherlands and Mabuwaya Foundation (Philippines) (Weerd and Balbas 2009). In nearby Berbak National Park, the Zoological Society of London is developing the ‘Berbak Carbon Initiative’ to develop carbon markets to protect swamp forest (Suratno and Maddox 2010), which may indirectly benefit local <em>T. schlegelii </em>populations. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>In 2010 the CSG Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan was updated, including an update on status and conservation priorities for <em>T. schlegelii</em> (Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2010). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Despite these efforts, <em>T. schlegelii</em> conservation is constrained by a lack of long-term research and conservation programs. Virtually all initiatives are conducted with limited funds, often on a voluntary basis, and by virtue of their brief duration have not been sufﬁcient to develop expanded conservation programs. There is a need to assign and fund full-time persons who will coordinate <em>T. schlegelii</em> conservation efforts, including the preparation of funding proposals and lobbying for integration of <em>T. schlegelii </em>into the workplans of provincial governments and international projects.</p>  <p><br/> <em>Tomistoma schlegelii</em> has no commercial skin value, precluding conservation efforts based on ranching as conducted for some other crocodilians.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

3149565,908,Alosa alabamae,Near Threatened,A2ac,2021,2020-04-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Alosa alabamae </em>is a coastal, schooling, and anadromous species that returns to natal rivers to spawn. Historically, this species was very widely distributed throughout the coastal waters and associated rivers of the Gulf of Mexico. However, very little is known about this species within its marine range. As this is an anadromous species, it has been heavily impacted by habitat alteration and dam placement that prohibits it from reaching natal spawning grounds throughout its range. As a direct result, its global population has undergone declines in abundance compared to historical levels. Additionally, there are estimated declines in Area of Occupancy (AOO) approaching 30% over the most recent ten years available (2001 – 2010), thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths. More recent distribution information or population abundance estimates (2011 – 2020) are not available. Based on limited reports of successful threat mitigation throughout its range, it is inferred that the rate of decline in AOO has not changed. It is therefore suspected that the declines in the global population size have tracked closely with declines in AOO and are nearing 30%. This species’ relatively short generation length coupled with relatively recent Population Viability Analyses and recent reports of attempts to increase available spawning habitat (e.g., ‘conservation locking’, fish passages, etc.) in parts of its range indicates recovery from low population levels over time in the absence of threats may be possible. However, despite local information on conservation efforts and success using these mitigative techniques in parts of its range, no current evidence is available to suggest these initiatives are taking place on a wide enough scale to cause a drastic increase in spawning habitat availability at this time, despite urgency expressed by state managers and researchers dating back to at least the late 1990s. <em>Alosa alabamae</em>&#160;nearly meets the requirements for Vulnerable under criterion A2ac; therefore, it is conservatively assessed as Near Threatened. Additional conservation actions should be taken to mitigate current spawning restrictions and provide further access to suitable spawning habitats. Further research is urgently needed regarding this species' population abundance as it may in fact, qualify for a threatened category.</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>This is an anadromous species that presumably spends much of its life schooling in coastal marine waters before migrating into natal rivers to spawn (Mickle<em> et al. </em>2015). It is known to a maximum standard length of 51 cm (Whitehead 1985).<em> </em>Little is known about its ecology when utilizing marine habitats (Mickle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), but it is thought that it primarily feeds in coastal marine waters (Mettee and O'Neil 2003) before migrating up into rivers during spring months (February – May: Mickle <em>et al. </em>2015). Kern <em>et al. </em>(2017) reports that upstream movement in the Lower Flint River, Georgia is greatest during April – mid-May. Juveniles reside in their natal drainage&#160;during&#160;the summer and fall and migrate to the Gulf of Mexico in late fall or winter (Barkuloo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993). Overall, the spawning habitat requirements of this species varies. Researchers support that this species spawns in shoal habitat downstream of the JWLD based on observations of the species congregating over the shoals during spawning season, as well as usage by other spawning anadromous species, such as the Gulf Sturgeon, <em>Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi</em> (NOAA 2017). In northwest Florida, spawning occurs in moderate currents over coarse sand and gravel (Laurence and Yerger 1966, Mills 1972). Adults selected limerock boulder substrate and used sandy substrate in the same proportion of its availability as preferred spawning grounds in the Lower Flint River, Georgia (Kern <em>et al. </em>2017). Mettee <em>et al. </em>(1996) suspects that spawning occurs in late afternoon or at night. In Missouri, young have been captured in swift water about rock wing dikes in the Osage River and over rocky shoals with a noticeable current in the Gasconade River (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). </p><p>  </p><p>Males reach sexual maturity between 1 to 5 years of age and females at 2 to 6 years in the Choctawhatchee River, Alabama and Florida (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). Age-2 and -3 adults are the most prevalent age class of spawning adults and repeat spawning is common, but the percentage of returning spawners is highly variable among years&#160;(Laurence and Yerger 1966, Mettee and O’Neil 2003). Given that it is known to have a maximum longevity of up to 6 years and females are known to reach maturity as early as two years (Mettee and O'Neil 2003), declines in population abundance and/or distribution should therefore be estimated over a time period of 10 years (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). </p><p></p>","<p></p><p>As this is an anadromous fish that requires an extensive spawning migration from coastal marine waters into natal rivers, the decline of this species’ global population and distribution is likely to be due to the<strong> </strong>modification and impoundment of riverine systems (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2011, NOAA 2017). Locks and dams built for navigation, hydroelectric generation, and flood control have effectively blocked migration routes to many historic upstream spawning areas for&#160;this species (Robison and Buchanan 1988, Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). High-lift navigation dams on the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers have blocked spawning migrations in the Mobile basin. Furthermore, streams have been degraded by siltation and pollution, and commercial and navigational dredging of sand bars has further degraded or eliminated some spawning habitats. Suspected threats to the remaining subpopulations in Alabama include increased sedimentation, pesticide runoff from agricultural operations, prolonged drought, and possible reservoir construction for water supply on major tributaries (Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Additionally, NOAA (2017) suggests that low population abundance also poses a moderate threat to this species. This species is suspected to have been negatively impacted by threats within its marine distribution (Gulf of Mexico), possibly from impacts stemming from the Deepwater Horizon Oil spill, given the poor physiological condition and visible wounds/lesions present on the body of captured adults during spawning runs in the years following the oil spill and anecdotal evidence of other fish species with similar lesions; however, this cause is unconfirmed and the physiological condition improved in 2014 (Sammons 2014). In the past, harvesting in the Ohio River was considered a major threat to this species; however, no commercial harvest records exist after the early 1900s (<span class=""copy"">Hildenbrand 1963), and is no longer considered a threat. More research is urgently needed to determine the current (2011 – 2020) extent of suspected decline in abundance and estimated decline in available spawning habitat from these threats.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><strong>OVERALL POPULATION INFORMATION </strong></p>  <p>Limited population information is available for this species throughout its range and the total global adult population size is unknown; however, declines at least approaching 30% are suspected. Most of the species-specific information available is from the Apalachicola River in northwest Florida (NOAA 2017). The studies conducted in the ACF (Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint) river system are the only abundance estimates, either historic or current, for this species in any river system (NOAA 2017). General information presented below refer to the historic or current distribution of this species in river systems and are primarily based on capture data from multi-species surveys, project monitoring, incidental catches and anecdotal information (NOAA 2017). It is also known to migrate into the marine waters along the Gulf coast; however, little is known about this species within the marine environment, despite it spending a majority of its life there (NOAA 2017).</p>  <p>Overall, this species has declined, and in some cases, has been extirpated from large portions of its historical range (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). For example, it is suspected to have severely declined or may be extirpated from Iowa, Tennessee and Louisiana (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). It has been eliminated from much of its former inland distribution, especially in the Mobile Basin and the Mississippi River Valley (M. Warren 1999 pers. comm., Boschung and Mayden 2004); subpopulations are small and are now very rare throughout the entire Mississippi River basin (Lee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1980, Robison and Buchanan 1988, Etnier and Starnes 1993, Pflieger 1997). It is considered rare or extirpated in much of its former range in Alabama (Boschung and Mayden 2004), including the upper Tombigbee, Cahaba, Coosa, and upper Alabama rivers (Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). As of around 1990, abundance was evidently still declining in the Pearl River system of Louisiana and Mississippi (Gunning and Suttkus 1990), and Ross (2001) reported that this species may be extirpated in the Pearl River. </p>  <p>Schaffler <em>et al. </em>(2015) reports that the Apalachicola River system has the largest extant subpopulation, but remnant subpopulations do occur in the Choctawhatchee River in Florida and Alabama, and the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. NOAA (2017) indicates this species was previously distributed within roughly 21 major river systems and associated tributaries at least throughout some time in history. It is estimated that ten out of the 21 known river systems still support spawning subpopulations (&lt;50%) with suitable, accessible habitat, and include the Apalachicola drainage, parts of the Mississippi, Missouri, Meramec, White, Ouachita, Pascagoula, Escambia (and Conecuh), Choctawhatchee and Suwannee rivers (NOAA 2017). It is suspected that this species' global population abundance has greatly diminished over the past 20 – 50 years range and is likely, or potentially extirpated from much of its former inland distribution where it has not been observed in many years, including the Ohio, Arkansas, Red, Illinois and Mary rivers, as well as the upper and lower Mississippi River mainstem (NOAA 2017). It is also considered rare or is sporadically recorded in parts of its range, such as in the Mobile Bay and Mobile River basin, Lake Pantchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and the Tangipahoa, Pearl, Ochlockonee and the Econfina rivers (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p>As global population data are not available, the decline in population size was suspected based on the decline in AOO. Based on its distribution between 2001-2010, and the inference that the rate of decline has remained constant, it is suspected that the total global population size has declined by nearly 30%. Current distribution data as well as abundance data are urgently needed.</p>  <p><strong>RIVER/BASIN SPECIFIC INFORMATION:</strong></p>  <p><strong>Apalachicola River Drainage:</strong></p>  <p>Most of the information regarding this species is from the Apalachicola River in northwest Florida where the largest subpopulation remains below the Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD). The ACF River system contains the largest spawning subpopulation of this species within its range, although the subpopulation may be several orders of magnitude<strong> </strong>smaller than historical levels (Sammons 2014, Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017).</p>  <p>Previously, researchers collected 141 Alabama shad in the Apalachicola in 1966 over the course of 17 sampling days using a variety of methods (Laurence and Yerger 1966), 251 were captured in 1969–1970 (Mills 1972) and 400 were captured from 1994 to 2000 in the Choctawhatchee River (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). These relatively low catch rates suggest low abundances in previous years (Ely&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). </p>  <p>Apalachicola&#160;Alabama Shad exhibit low genetic diversity, which may inhibit its ability to respond to unanticipated environmental and anthropogenic changes (Moyer 2012). Smith&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2011) conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) of Alabama Shad in the Apalachicola River System and predicted that the subpopulation was increasing and could reach carrying capacity in about 40 years given the conditions remain favourable (e.g., allowing passage of spawning adults through the dam). However, this subpopulation declined rapidly after 2013 from unknown causes and has remained at a low level (S. Sammons pers. comm. April 2020).</p>  <p>Despite apparent declines in global population size over time, the subpopulation of this species within the ACF River system has remained self-sustaining and therefore, a project to restore passage to upstream spawning habitats has been initiated (Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015). Cooperative studies supported by many local, academic, state, and federal partners have started tracking the movements of this species in 2005 in the Apalachicola River (USFWS 2008, Ely <em>et al. </em>2008, TNC 2010, NOAA 2017). Results of this collaborative study showed that the existing lock at JWLD could be operated to allow movement upriver and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began ‘conservation locking’ to provide this species with upstream access (NOAA 2017). Abundance of this species prior to 2005, including prior to the installation of the dam, were never estimated (Ely&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008), but these improvements in facilitating fish passage is thought to have allowed recruitment to increase in recent years (Young&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Schaffler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and are expected to be a major component of the future restoration of this species in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015).</p>  <p>Adult subpopulation estimates (spring), adult CPUE (spring) and juvenile CPUE (fall) are available for this species in the ACF River system between 2005 – 2016 and are based on mark-recapture methods (NOAA 2017). Adult subpopulation estimates show high variability (approximately 122,500 individuals estimated in 2012, compared to 300 and 0 individuals estimated in 2015 and 2016, respectively) during this time series but are based on whether ‘conservation locking’ took place (NOAA 2017). During periods of ‘conservation locking’ this species was successfully able to pass upstream and yield higher subpopulation estimates overall indicating better recruitment (Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017). However, in the years where ‘conservation locking’ did not take place due to lock maintenance and upgrades (2013 and 2014) and in the years directly after (2015 and 2016), adult subpopulation estimates were low (i.e., below 2,000 individuals). Spawning subpopulation size estimates were attempted in the Apalachicola River in 2014; however, too few individuals were collected to allow for a subpopulation estimate (Sammons 2014). More recently, egg collection for this species was more successful than larvae collection, but still much lower than that of the similar American Shad (<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>) and it is possible that the low efficiency resulted from low densities of adults, as few adult individuals were collected below JWLD in 2017 (Sammons 2018). </p>  <p>Spawning individuals are now able to access over 150 miles (241.4 km) of necessary historical habitat and spawning areas in the ACF River system for the first time in over 50 years now that the JWLD lock operates within their natural spawning cues (TNC 2010, NOAA 2017). ‘Conservation locking’ is thought to be making a tremendous impact on this species within the ACF River system; adults are most commonly found in the Flint River arm of Lake Seminole above the JWLD (Sammons 2013, Sammons 2014) and juveniles are likely able to move downstream to contribute to the adult stock (NOAA 2017). Despite the enhancement of spawning and recruitment of this species due to ‘conservation locking’ (Young 2010, 2011, Sammons and Young 2012, Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017), and although the ACF River system has had the largest known subpopulation of this species for decades, the lack of ‘conservation locking’ in 2013 and 2014 due to maintenance, combined with environmental conditions (cold and flooding) and poor condition of spawning adults (unexplained visible wounds) probably produced the weakest year class since research began on this species in 2005 (Sammons 2014, NOAA 2017). </p>  <p>Temperature is one of the main cues for this species to enter the ACF River system to spawn (Kern <em>et al. </em>2017). The unusually low water temperatures in 2013 and 2014 may have hindered the usual spawning cues for this species resulting in a limited number of fish migrating upstream (Sammons 2014). High water and discharge during this time may have also hindered catch rates, but more likely spawning subpopulation size was very low (Sammons 2014).</p>  <p>Differences in the trends of the adult subpopulation of this species can be partially explained by differing sampling effort due to environmental conditions and funding levels; however, researchers suspect the spawning subpopulation in the ACF River system in 2013 – 2016 was dangerously low compared to the 2009 – 2012 spawning subpopulations (Sammons 2014, NOAA 2017). Access to the more than 150 miles of spawning habitat for this species above Lake Seminole through ‘conservation locking’ appears to be necessary to increase the current low population levels. </p>  <p>Similar to other Clupeids, this species exhibits natural variability, and given that there are no historic estimates to compare to recent populations trends, it is very difficult to interpret population trends for this species (NOAA 2017). The studies conducted in the ACF River system are the only abundance estimates for this species throughout its global range, either historical or current, for this species in any river system (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Mississippi River:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically found in several parts of the Mississippi River and its tributaries (NOAA 2017). For example, it was known as far north as Keokuk, Iowa (Coker 1930), the Ohio River at Louisville (Evermann 1902) and eastern Oklahoma (Moore 1957, Miller and Robison 2004). Despite sporadic observations of this species and reports of depletion in the basin (e.g., Lee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1980, Page and Burr 1991), several small spawning subpopulations remain (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Upper Mississippi River Mainstem:</strong></p>  <p>The Upper Mississippi River is the portion upstream of Cairo, Illinois. This species was recorded in a 1994 annual status report as being captured in a long-term resource monitoring program (Grutreuter <em>et al. </em>1997); however, no species data (i.e., number caught, gear used, location, etc.) were reported. Currently, there are 10 locks or dams on the Upper Mississippi River that border the state of Iowa and an addition seven locks and dams south of Iowa which likely prevent this species from reaching historical spawning grounds (Steuck <em>et al. </em>2010). Iowa DNR has not collected this species in the Upper Mississippi River in more than 25 years (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011), and no recent information is available to suggest otherwise between the year 2011 and present day (2020). </p>  <p><strong>Missouri River:</strong></p>  <p>The Missouri Fish and Wildlife Information System maintained by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) states that this species spawns in the Missouri River and two of its tributaries, the Gasconade and Osage Rivers (MDC 2015). Galat (2005) reported the presence of this species in the lower Missouri River in 2005 and stated that it is rare in the Ozark Plateaus region in southern Missouri. The MDC reported this species has been captured in the Missouri River at least up until 2012 in multi-species surveys (NOAA 2017).</p>  <p><strong>Meramec River:</strong></p>  <p>Burr <em>et al. </em>(2004) and Buchannan <em>et al. </em>(2012) list the Meramec River as one of the remaining spawning rivers of this species in Missouri and is supported by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC 2015). </p>  <p><strong>Lower Mississippi Mainstem:</strong></p>  <p>The Lower Mississippi River (south of Cairo, Illinois) used to provide a means for this species to reach many of its tributaries; however, no individuals have been found in the lower portion of the waterway in recent years in annual fish surveys conducted by USGS (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011, NOAA 2017).&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Ohio River:</strong></p>  <p>This species used to be present and abundant enough to support a small commercial fishery in the Ohio River during the late 19<sup>th</sup> century; however, by 1989, this species was extirpated from this river (Pearson and Pearson 1989). It has not been collected or observed from this river or the Tennessee River since the early 1990s (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). </p>  <p><strong>Arkansas River:</strong></p>  <p>No records of this species exist from the Arkansas River since the 1890s; however, few individuals may have been captured from its tributaries in the 1950s, but this is unclear (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>1983). This species may have been extirpated from the watershed due to dams (NOAA 2017). In a two-year intensive field sampling study of this species in Arkansas rivers, special emphasis was placed on sampling in the Ouachita and Arkansas rivers in 2019; however, conditions were not suitable for safe and effective fish sampling due to excessive flooding, therefore sampling did not take place in the Arkansas River (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). In 2020, sampling was conducted in the Arkansas River below the four most downstream dams, but no individuals were collected (Eggleton pers comm. June 2020). However, sampling was delayed due to field restrictions from the COVID-19 outbreak and did not allow for sampling to take place during optimal spawning times (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020).</p>  <p><strong>Red River:</strong></p>  <p>This species has not been collected from the Red River or its tributaries since around the 1980s (e.g., Matthews and Robison 1988, Buchannan <em>et al. </em>2003, Smith <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p><strong>Illinois and Marys Rivers:</strong></p>  <p>There are historical records of this species within the Illinois rivers (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011); however, the abundance is not known (NOAA 2017). This species appears to have been extirpated from many Illinois rivers and are considered rare in the state (NOAA 2017). Annual field studies have yielded no additional records of this species (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p><strong>White River:</strong></p>  <p>The White River (Arkansas) is a minor tributary of the Mississippi River. Three juveniles were collected from the White River in 2006, which confirms there is probably a small spawning subpopulation (Buchanan <em>et al. </em>2012). In an ongoing two-year sampling study of this species in Arkansas rivers (2019 – 2020: Eggleton <em>et al</em>. 2019), three reaches of the White River were sampled for this species in 2020 and resulted in zero collected individuals (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020). However, sampling was delayed due to field restrictions from the COVID-19 outbreak and did not allow for sampling to take place during optimal spawning times (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020). </p>  <p><strong>Ouachita River:</strong></p>  <p>The Ouachita River is a minor tributary of the Mississippi River and includes the Little Missouri and Saline Rivers. This species is rare in Arkansas rivers overall and only a handful of adults have ever been collected; however, most individuals (adult and juvenile) have been taken from the middle Ouachita River and its largest tributary, the Little Missouri River (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). The Ouachita and Little Missouri Rivers are thought to contain very small spawning subpopulations of this species given that a majority of the 767 individuals ever collected (since 1879) were juveniles, and may represent the limit of their inland spawning migrations (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). There have been no recent reports of this species in the Saline River (Buchanan <em>et al. </em>1999); only a single specimen was collected in 1972 (Eggleton <em>et al</em>. 2019). An ongoing, two-year sampling study (2019 – 2020) of this species in the Ouachita River basin represents one of the most intensive efforts ever made to collect this species in Arkansas, but has yielded only a single adult male specimen and zero juveniles (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although it is likely this species was present in the Ouachita basin in 2019, severe hydrological conditions (e.g., excessive flooding) during the likely spawning window limited the ability for researchers to collect data on this species (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p>  <p><strong>Lake Pantchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and the Tangipahoa River:</strong></p>  <p>This species is caught sporadically within Louisiana, but data are limited within its rivers (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). </p>  <p><strong>Pearl River:</strong></p>  <p>This species has been reported in low numbers from the Pearl River in multi-species studies; however, this may be due to limited sampling effort during spawning periods (NOAA 2017). Smith <em>et al. </em>(2011) reported no individuals have been captured since the 1990s and Ross (2001) reported that this species may be extirpated in the Pearl River, but museum records attained by Tulane University in 2004 suggests otherwise (FishNet2 portal accessed March 2020). </p>  <p><strong>Pascagoula River:</strong></p>  <p>This Pascagoula River system (Pascagoula, Leaf and Chickasawhay Rivers) is the only system within the state of Mississippi inhabited by this species (Mickle <em>et al. </em>2010, Mickle 2010, NOAA 2017) and has one of the remaining spawning subpopulations of this species (Mickle 2006).<strong> </strong></p>  <p><strong>Mobile Bay and the Mobile River Basin:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically prevalent in the Mobile River basin (Evermann and Kendall 1897) and some studies suggest that subpopulations persist (e.g., Boschung and Mayden 2004, Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004); however, few individuals have been captured throughout the basin in recent years (NOAA 2017). For example, the most recent Mobile Basin records are limited to&#160;single adult individuals collected in the Black Warrior River in 1998 (the first record from that river in more than 100 years) and in the Alabama River in 1993 and 1995 (Mettee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996). In an effort to establish an annual spawning run in the Alabama River, 53 individuals in 2014 and 27 individuals in 2015 were captured below the JWLD in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015). Collected individuals were tagged with transmitters and stocked below the Claiborne Lock and Dam in 2014 and below the Miller’s Ferry Lock and Dam in 2015 in the Alabama River (Kern and Sammons 2015). No Alabama Shad were found to have successfully navigated upstream of either dam (Kern and Sammons 2015). </p>  <p><strong>Escambia River and Conecuh River:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically documented in the Escambia and Conecuh Rivers as early as 1900 (Evermann and Kendall 1900) and contains one of the known remaining spawning subpopulations (Robison and Buchanan 1988, Mettee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). </p>  <p><strong>Choctawhatchee River:</strong></p>  <p>Some studies indicate there are small spawning subpopulations of this species in southern Alabama including the Choctawhatchee and Pea Rivers (Robison and Buchanan 1988, Barkuloo <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993, Mettee <em>et al. </em>1996, Adams <em>et al. </em>2000, Mettee and O’Neil 2003, Young 2010). </p>  <p><strong>Ochlockonee River:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically present in the Ochlockonee River between Georgia and Florida (NOAA 2017). Few specimens have been taken from this river since the late 1970s (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Econfina River:</strong></p>  <p>Historical data for this species are not available from the Ecofina River, but a single individual was captured here in 2006 (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Suwannee River:</strong></p>  <p>Historically, the Suwannee River has been the easternmost boundary of this species’ range (Herald and Strickland 1946) and Smith <em>et al. </em>(2011) reports that there is still a spawning subpopulation in the river. However, more recent information is unavailable.</p><br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>This species was historically widely distributed throughout coastal waters and river systems along the Gulf of Mexico off the United States and eastern Oklahoma in the Ouachita River system, east to the Mississippi River and the Suwannee River in Florida (Coker 1930, Lee <em>et al. </em>1980, Pattillo <em>et al. </em>1997, Kern <em>et al. </em>2017, NOAA 2017). It was known to reach freshwater rivers as far inland as Oklahoma, Iowa and West Virginia (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). According to Mickle&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010), the range of this species has contracted to only the Pascagoula River drainage in Mississippi; however, Young&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2012) documents the existence of a reproducing population in the Apalachicola River in Florida and Smith <em>et al. </em>(2011) reported the present distribution extends up the Mississippi River drainage into eastern Arkansas and central Missouri. </p><p>NOAA (2013, 2017) recognizes the current freshwater range of this species to include the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint (ACF) River system above Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD) in Florida/Georgia/Alabama, the Pea and Choctawhatchee rivers in Alabama, the Pearl River in Louisiana/Mississippi, and the Little Missouri River in Arkansas as reported by Smith&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011). Limited information is available about its distribution in marine waters. The depth range of this species is unknown; however, similar to other closely related species, it probably occupies depths between 0–50 metres.</p><p>    </p><p>As spawning occurs in riverine environments, its freshwater extent was used to determine the area of occupancy (AOO), calculated from a 4 km² grid, and extent of occurrence (EOO), based on a minimum convex polygon. Based on the rivers where this species was distributed in 2001 and 2010 (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011), the AOO declined by from 8,816 km² in 2001 to 6,576 km² in 2010 and the EOO declined by from 897,311 km² in 2001 and 341,562 km² in 2010. Although more recent distribution data are not available, the rate of decline in AOO was inferred to have remained constant over the last 10 years. Therefore, we extrapolated the data to the present using an exponential regression, which results in an inferred decline in AOO of 27.8%.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Alabama Shad were harvested for food from the Ohio River in Indiana and Kentucky, several rivers in Alabama, and the Ouachita River in Arkansas in the 1800s (Mettee and O'Neil 2003). Formerly, commercial fishing in the Ohio River amounted to several thousand pounds harvested per year and was considered a major threat to this species<span class=""copy"">. Commercial landings of this species were reported at 3,165 kg in 1889 and 48 kg in 1902 (Hildenbrand 1963). It&#160;disappeared from fishery statistics in the early 1900s and commercial landings have not been reported since (Hildenbrand 1963), possibly due to the construction of high lift locks and dams that blocked upstream migrations (Mettee and O'Neil 2003).<span class=""copy""></span></p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>This species is listed on the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Species of Concern List (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011) and has been petitioned to be included as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA: NOAA 2017). Despite being listed as a Species of Concern, this status does not carry any procedural or substantive federal protections (NOAA 2017). An overall paucity of available data regarding the life history and abundance of this species has ultimately prevented it from receiving more urgent conservation efforts based on the criteria used for the ESA (Grice <em>et al. </em>2014, NOAA 2017). Regardless of the lack of federal protection, it is protected by some states where it is currently, or was previously distributed (Meadows <em>et al. </em>2008, Mickle <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017, Eggleton <em>et al. </em>2019), as many have enacted recovery and conservation plans in response to river-wide declines.</p><p>State and Federal agencies are working with conservation groups and researchers to restore passage of Alabama Shad to their historic range upstream of Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD) in the Apalachicola basin. In 2008, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began ‘conservation locking’ by operating the lock at JWLD to provide Alabama shad access to upstream habitat (NOAA 2013). Subpopulation increases have been documented upon the strategic opening of a navigation lock on the Jim Woodruff dam by maximizing attraction flow near the lock entrance and increasing the time the upper gates are open during an afternoon locking cycle to&#160;allow fish to pass to spawning grounds (Young&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Efforts to pass shad through the lock have resulted in the passage of shad through Lake Seminole and into the Chattahoochee and Flint River systems in Georgia. These efforts are expected to continue to be a major component supporting the restoration of this species in the ACF River system (Kern and Sammons 2015). </p><p>The translocation of adults and supplemental stocking of juvenile fish from the ACF river system has been attempted in the past in Georgia with some success (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020); however, adults transported into the Alabama River showed with little success due to a low number of individuals at the JWLD lock (Kern and Sammons 2015). Approximately 10,000 fry in 2013 and 102,000 fry in 2017 were stocked in the upper Flint River above Lake Blackshear that were spawned from adults captured below the JWLD; however, stock contribution was never evaluated (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020). In 2012, roughly 100 adults captured below the JWLD were transported into to Lake Blackshear; young of the year were captured in fall gillnetting samples, thus indicating successful spawning of stocked adults (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020). In Alabama, adult individuals were captured below the JWLD in 2014 and 2015 and transported into the Alabama River to establish and annual spawning run; however, no Alabama shad were found to have successfully navigated upstream of either dam (Kern and Sammons 2015). If numbers of this species increase in the future at the JWLD, it is likely that this method will be attempted again in Georgia and Alabama, as it may be one of the only ways to reintroduce this species into the mobile drainage (Kern and Sammons 2015, S. Sammons pers. comm. May 2020).</p><p>In an effort to establish an annual spawning run in the Alabama River, 53 individuals in 2014 and 27 individuals in 2015 were captured below the JWLD in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015). Collected individuals were tagged with transmitters and stocked below the Claiborne Lock and Dam in 2014 and below the Miller’s Ferry Lock and Dam in 2015 in the Alabama River (Kern and Sammons 2015). No Alabama Shad were found to have successfully navigated upstream of either dam (Kern and Sammons 2015).</p><p>Research into effective fish passages, restoration of hydrologic regimes, migrations, feeding, bycatch, spawning, rearing, and other habitat needs should be carried out (Meadows&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Spawning habitats require protection and/or restoration, including maintaining flow regimes that would allow for large sandbars and preserve accumulation of large woody debris along steep riverbanks and enabling effective passage for fish throughout watershed&#160;drainages (Mickle&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Buchanan<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012). The variation in year-class strength typical to this genus suggests that subpopulations of Alabama shad can recover quickly to historic levels under favorable conditions (Ely<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2008). The majority of the&#160;subpopulation in the Apalachicola River system is dependent upon access to spawning in the Flint River; therefore, priorities to maintain the connectivity of this waterway are essential (Schaffler<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2015). Additionally, efforts to provide passage at other upstream barriers should be examined for the expansion of restoration efforts of this species (Sammons 2014), similar to efforts initiated at the JWLD. </p><p>            Subpopulations could increase if favorable environmental conditions are restored throughout its current range and recovery may be high in parts of its range with unimpounded systems and where management actions have already allowed for upstream passage for spawning runs. Beyond this, there is a need for studies focused on the adult life stage in marine and estuarine environments (Sammons 2014, Mickle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Mettee and O'Neil (2003) recommend research on its distribution, spawning season variation, population size, fecundity, diet, and movements in the Mississippi River and its major tributaries and in Gulf Coast drainages containing known subpopulations. Future studies should also focus on potential environmental and biological mechanisms that may govern spawning stock size and survival (Sammons 2014).</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,"Global, Caribbean & Gulf of Mexico"

As such, we reaffirm the prior assessment of the taxonomically restricted Mojave Desert Tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, as Critically Endangered, and add criterion “a” for direct population observations: CR A2abce+A4abce. The previously defined widespread species&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu lato</em>)&#160;was last assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1996; a separate assessment currently in progress by the TFTSG for the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai </em>(previously considered part of <em>G. agassizii</em>)&#160;has provisionally assessed that species as Vulnerable.","The life history of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is typical of long-lived chelonians and has been reviewed by Berry and Murphy (2019). Tortoises require 17–20 years to reach sexual maturity at a straight-line carapace length (CL) of 18 cm or more (Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, Medica <em>et al</em>. 2012). Variation in years is dependent on desert region, frequency of droughts, and quality of available forage. In the northern part of the geographic range, females smaller than 20.9 cm were not reproducing (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998).&#160; Maximum lifespan was estimated by Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) at 75 years, but few live beyond 50 yrs in the wild (Germano 1992). Generation time was estimated to be 20–32 years (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, USFWS 1994). Based on data from three desert regions, mean sizes of females ranges from 21.4 to 23.1 cm, whereas the mean sizes of males ranged from 24.3 to 24.9 cm; the largest desert tortoises on record, a male, reached 38.1 cm carapace length (Stebbins 2003), whereas a female was 37.4 cm, but these animals were exceptions (Berry and Murphy 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Mature females may lay clutches of one to 10 eggs in up to three clutches per year in spring and early summer; in some years, some females do not lay eggs (Rostal <em>et al</em>. 1994, Henen 1997, Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wallis <em>et al</em>. 1999, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual fecundity ranges from 0 to 16 eggs (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2015). Several factors may affect egg production: site, year, size of female, size and number of eggs, and available water and protein from precipitation and forage in the year preceding egg laying, as well as the year eggs are laid (Henen 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Incubation times for eggs range from 67 to 104 days (Burge 1977, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hatching success varies and appears to depend on year, location of the nest, and whether it is the first or second clutch. Eggs may be infertile or broken during laying (e.g., 12%; Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). Many nests are destroyed by predators before hatching and the loss of eggs (and nests) varies by year (Turner et al. 1987); they estimated an average loss of 37.1% of nests in a multi-year study. Hatching success in intact nests, undisturbed by predators, has been shown to vary from 73 to 100% (McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Rostal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bjurlin and Bissonette 2004, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises inhabit desert scrub habitats, including saltbush, creosote bush, Joshua Trees and Mojave yuccas, and microphyll woodlands with ironwood, palo verde, desert willow, and smoke trees (Berry and Murphy 2019). In the northeastern part of their geographic range, they occur in an ecotone between the Mojave and Great Basin deserts with sand sagebrush and junipers. Actual occurrences tend to be in valleys, alluvial fans, bajadas, and ephemeral stream channels, although tortoises can be found in low sand dunes and on steep slopes of mesas and cliffs (Berry and Murphy 2019).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises are herbivorous and selective in their choice of plant species (Jennings 1993, Oftedal 2002, Oftedal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jennings and Berry 2015). They primarily eat forbs when available. In years of abundant precipitation, they are selective feeders and prefer specific species of annuals and herbaceous perennials in the legume, mallow, borage, aster, four o’clock, and cactus families (as well as other families). Although they eat grasses, a diet solely of grasses is deficient in nutrients and is likely to inhibit growth and survival, especially in neonate, juveniles, and immature tortoises (Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The quality and quantity of preferred plant foods has diminished because of continuing invasion of non-native annual grasses and forbs and increased fire associated with the highly combustible&#160;non-native grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).&#160;<br/><br/>Annual survival and mortality of adults is dependent on sex, size of the tortoise, frequency and severity of droughts, numbers and types of anthropogenic uses, location, and decade of study. In a multi-year study in the eastern Mojave Desert, annual survivorship of juveniles increased with size, ranging from 0.767 when &lt;6.0 cm to 0.861 when 6.0 to 17.9 cm (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). When tortoises reach breeding age at an estimated 18.0 cm, survival rates were 0.87 to 0.944. Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported an annual survival of 0.883 for adults at Joshua Tree National Park. In a study in the Colorado Desert, Agha <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated adult survival at a wind-turbine energy site (0.96) and an adjacent area (0.92). At two sites in the eastern Mojave Desert, Longshore <em>et al</em>. (2003) reported annual survival of adults of 0.985 and 0.829, with the lower survival rate at a site affected by drought.<br/><br/>Woodbury and Hardy (1948) estimated that 1% of adults died per year in a population mostly comprised of adults. In the northeastern Mojave Desert, Turner <em>et al</em>. (1984) reported mortality rates of 18.4% in a year of drought and 4.4% in a normal year. In the western Mojave Desert, death rates were lowest at a protected Research Natural Area (2.8%/yr) and highest in critical habitat (20.4%/yr). At Joshua Tree National Park, the mortality rate was 11.7% (Freilich <em>et al.</em> 2000), and in Red Rock State Park, 67% (Berry et al. 2008). In a demographic study of tortoises at 21 sites in the central Mojave Desert, mortality rates of adults ranged from 1.9 to 95.2% (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) predicted an annual rate of population increase of <em>ca</em>. 2% in a model based on a tortoise subpopulation in the eastern Mojave Desert between 1977 and 1985. By 2000, this subpopulation had declined precipitously, apparently due to disease (see Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2002) estimated the recruitment rate of young tortoises into the adult subpopulation at 0.092 in a plot in Joshua Tree National Park. This number of tortoises on this plot was thought to be stable between 1991 and 1995, but later declined (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>&#160;faces&#160;multiple threats to individuals, populations, and habitat (for annotated bibliographies of reports and published papers, see Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980; Berry 1984; USFWS 1990, 1994, 2010, 2011; Grover and DeFalco 1995; Bury and Luckenbach 2002; von Senckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002; Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2011; Lovich and Ennen 2013a; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015; Berry and Murphy 2019). Recent articles document further examples of threats (Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b,c). Much of the information with numerous references are contained in Berry and Murphy (2019). Substantial tortoise habitat was already lost to cities, towns, settlements, agriculture, energy developments, and military bases in the 20th century, and continuing habitat loss and degradation, combined with high mortality rates in dwindling low-density populations due to disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis), road and off-road vehicle-induced mortality, subsidized predators (e.g., ravens), poaching for pets, and mortality from increasing droughts associated with climate change, are threatening most remaining populations of Desert Tortoises (summarized in Berry and Murphy 2019). The majority of desert tortoise populations are currently considered non-viable because of the low density of adults and their existence in isolated and fragmented pieces of habitat (Berry 1984, USFWS 2010, Allison and McLuckie 2018, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).&#160;<br/><br/>Many threats are cumulative in nature and interact synergistically with others. By rating them separately in the Standard Threats Classification Scheme below, the severity of threats and their negative impacts are not described in full measure. One of the limitations of the classification scheme for threats are the ratings for severity. Severity is associated with declines (or not) by percent over 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer. For species such as desert tortoises with long generation times (<em>ca</em>. 20–30 years), this may be 60 to 90 or more years. Here we provide a detailed and expanded Threats Classification Scheme for <em>G. agassizii</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Detailed Threats Classification Scheme<br/><br/></strong>Classification Level<br/><br/>&#160; a. Examples<br/>&#160; b. Timing and Scope<br/><br/>1.1 Housing &amp; urban areas, towns, settlements, ranches<br/>&#160; a. Desert cities, towns, settlements, scattered homes in rural areas, desert land entry, e.g., Inyokern, Ridgecrest, Red Mountain, Trona, Boron, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, Lucerne Valley, Ft. Irwin, Barstow, Daggett, Mountain Pass, Joshua Tree, Twentynine Palms, Vidal Junction, Ludlow, Amboy, Needles, Las Vegas, St. George, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, Parker, Blythe, El Centro,&#160;Stateline, Las Vegas, Mesquite, St. George.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, disappearance of tortoises and habitat; 20% of geographic range. Loss of habitat from widespread and rapidly growing and expanding cities, towns, and settlements associated with high levels of human population growth in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts and loss and degradation of adjacent habitat (Hughson 2009, U.S. Census Bureau 2010). In the northwest and southwest portions of the geographic range, tortoise populations are locally extinct, absent from valleys and fans and in low densities on military bases.<br/><br/>1.2 Commercial &amp; Industrial<br/>&#160; a. Airports and landing strips, military bases, solar and wind farms.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, loss of tortoises and habitat; 8% of geographic range. Development and use of multiple airports, landing strips, several large military bases with ground disturbing activities (military manoeuvres), and solar and wind farms (with associated transmission lines and roads)&#160;result in degradation and loss of substantial habitat in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts.<br/><br/>1.3 Residential &amp; commercial; golf courses, tourism, recreation<br/>&#160; a. Golf courses are associated with cities and towns that currently exist or are expanding within or near Desert Tortoise habitat (e.g., Las Vegas, Henderson). Vehicle-oriented recreation and visitation are very high in many parts of both deserts including what is now critical habitat, several State Parks and National Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, museums, and other points of interest.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Loss and degradation of habitat, illegal collecting of tortoises: 30%. The high levels of visitor use pose severe threats to <em>G. agassizii</em> throughout remaining habitat as well as in critical habitat. For example, at Lake Mead National Recreation, annual records of visitors from 1946 was &gt;1 million visitors per year; by 2018 more than 7.5 million visits occurred (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/"" style=""color: purple;"">https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/</a>). In parts of critical habitat in the western Mojave Desert, visitor use is very high, e.g., visits and visitor days recorded annually from 2008–2018 ranged from 55,874 to 94,474 visits and 26,218 to 90,445 visitor days per year (USBLM 2019). Visitor use, particularly vehicle-oriented use, is very difficult to control; a substantial portion occurs off-highway and designated trails.&#160;Off-road vehicle recreational uses are associated with higher rates of deaths from gunshots in tortoises occurring in areas with high visitor use days (Berry 1986, 2020a).<br/><br/>2.1.3 Agriculture: Agro-industry farming<br/>&#160; a. Farms for cotton, alfalfa, pistachio, goat-nut, and other crops and dry farming in parts of the geographic range (e.g., Fremont, Antelope, Indian Wells, Victor, Apple, Lucerne, Mojave River, Chuckwalla and Virgin River valleys, bordering the Colorado River).<br/>&#160; b. Severe, cleared land, local areas, often expansive, throughout the geographic range. Historic and ongoing. Habitat and tortoises lost, 10%. Farming began very early (late 1800s) and continues to the present. Farming has negatively affected the water table locally, causing subsidence and fissures to develop in at least one area (Berry 1984), as well as altering vegetation in the vicinity. Habitat cleared for farming generally is used for industrial purposes, e.g., solar or off-road vehicle recreation after abandonment. Both agricultural and industrial uses are associated with influx and proliferation of non-native plants onto adjacent, high quality desert tortoise habitat and protected areas.<br/><br/>2.3.2 and 2.3.3 Agriculture: livestock farming &amp; ranching<br/>&#160; a. Cattle ranching, sheep grazing and driveways, allotments, licenses, and leases (often on federal lands); growing herds of feral burros and expansion into critical habitat.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Moderate to severe, historic (from 1850s), ongoing; 80% of the geographic range affected. Grazing of livestock and use of driveways was widespread and often intensive throughout the geographic range until the Taylor Grazing Act in 1932. Livestock grazing was widespread after that time but managed as an important desert use (e.g., Berry 1984, USBLM 1980). In 1990, after the tortoise was listed as threatened, sheep grazing continued but was excluded from critical habitat. Cattle grazing continued throughout much of critical habitat and still occurs in an estimated 17% of critical habitat (USFWS 2010). Feral burros also graze in tortoise habitats and are encroaching into one critical habitat (USFWS 2010; Berry et al. 2020c). Livestock cause degradation and loss of habitat through development of piospheres, trampling, altering cover, composition of shrubs and forage plants available for tortoises to eat (Webb and Stielstra 1979, Fleischner 1994, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Abella 2008, Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016). The disturbances created by grazing contributes to growth and proliferation of non-native, fire-prone, invasive grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992).<br/><br/>3.1 Energy production &amp; mining: oil and gas<br/>&#160; a. Oil and gas, drilling and exploration.<br/>&#160; b. Medium severity, local areas, &lt;1% of geographic range. Exploratory drilling has occurred in tortoise habitat and has left degraded and cleared areas of &lt; 1-2 ha, with spoil piles, drilling waste, and trash from the drilling operations spread over the area. These sites became focal points for camping and vehicle-oriented recreation, enlarging over time (K.H. Berry pers. obs.).<br/><br/>3.2 Energy production &amp; mining: mining and quarrying<br/>&#160; a. Small and large mines, exploratory pits, bulldozed areas, shafts, and major mines; quarries.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation on a local or regional scale; 5%. Mining on small and large scales began in the late 1800s, killing tortoises and destroying habitat. Roads were constructed to access potential mining areas and districts (Mojave,&#160;Rand, Atolia, Goldstone, Calico, Mountain Pass). Tortoises fall into pits and shafts and were killed. Some mines cover 7.8 km<sup>2</sup> or more and their influence can expand beyond that. Gold mines are associated with spread of mercury and arsenic in soils and plants far beyond the source (e.g., &gt;12 km), transported by wind and water (Chaffee&#160;and Berry 2006; Kim <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014). Tortoises are negatively affected by these elemental toxicants with poor health; these toxicants were reported in livers, integument, lungs, etc.&#160;(Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, Selzer and Berry 2005, Foster <em>et a</em>l. 2009).<br/><br/>3.3 Energy production &amp; mining: renewable energy<br/>&#160; a. Windfarms, photovoltaic, solar fields; new utility and transmission lines, power poles and towers with adjacent roads accompany these developments.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, future. Severe degradation and loss locally over large areas, 5% over the geographic range. Windfarms occur in tortoise habitat, generally on slopes or on hills and small mountains. Solar panels have been constructed on abandoned agricultural fields or in low density or marginal habitat. However, some projects were built in prime habitat, causing loss of habitat and displacement of tortoises. Solar and wind energy is a growing industry with losses of &gt;106 km<sup>2 </sup>as of 2019 (Mark Massar, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>4.1 Transportation and service corridors: roads &amp; railroads<br/>&#160; a. Freeways, 2-lane highways, county gravel or dirt roads, and roads to points of interest; railroads (two major) and several spurs with associated dirt roads and tower lay-down areas for power towers and poles.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe loss and degradation of habitat. 5% throughout the geographic range. Roads were developed in the late 1800s and have proliferated and widened into freeways since that time. Several major freeways and state highways cross the geographic range. Importantly many more dirt roads exist to points of interest (e.g., mines, mining areas, water troughs and water sources, outlying rural areas, recreation areas). Tortoise populations are depleted on either side of highways and well-used roads for distances of &gt;4,000 m (von Seckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002). A very small portion of these roads and highways have tortoise-proof fencing.<br/><br/>4.2 Transportation &amp; service corridors: utility &amp; service lines<br/>&#160; a. Telephone and electric poles and lines; major transmission lines and corridors.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, moderate to severe. Telephone poles and electric poles and lines usually parallel major or minor paved and dirt roads and extend from towns and cities&#160;into remote areas to provide service to agricultural developments, mines, wind and solar farms and individual residences or small settlements. Electric transmission lines cross many parts of the geographic range, including critical habitat (critical habitat alone: 1,634 km of lines in corridors, total area of corridors, 1,743.5 km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2010).&#160; These corridors are accompanied by dirt roads and spurs to the towers. Often corridors contain several sets of towers and electrical lines. Utility lines also include ground disturbance from fibre optic cables, aqueducts, and gas lines, all of which disturb tortoise habitat. Utility poles and transmission lines have allowed for spread of predators (Common Raven, Red-tailed Hawk) into remote parts of the desert, because they make use of the towers and poles for perching and nesting, leading to increased predation on tortoises (Knight and Kawashima 1993, Anderson and Berry 2019).<br/><br/>4.4 Transportation and service corridors: flight paths or military use<p>&#160; a. Commercial, non-commercial, and Department of Defence flight paths.<br/>&#160; b. Numerous, ongoing. Flight paths are minor or no impact if not associated with release of ordnance (bombing ranges). The noise may have effects on wildlife, including tortoises (e.g., Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>5.1.1 Biological resource use: hunting &amp; trapping terrestrial animals: intentional use (species is the target)<br/>&#160; a. Illegal collecting of <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>for commercial sale, food, cultural purposes, and for international trade, etc.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Tortoises have been and continue to be collected for pets, food, tourism,&#160;commercial sale, and cultural purposes, although such collection has been unlawful since 1939 (Berry 1984, Berry <em>et al</em>. 1996, Berry and Murphy 2019, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.1 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: recreational activities<br/>&#160; a. Visits to State and National Parks and Preserves, National Recreation Areas, federal and state lands, private lands, and Open Recreation Use Areas (unrestricted vehicle play areas) by vehicle-oriented recreationists.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe impacts regionally and locally, especially in the western, central, and southern Mojave Desert and growing in the western Sonoran Desert; associated with proximity to cities, towns, and settlements. Formerly populated with Desert Tortoises, several intensively used areas are now severely degraded and have few if any tortoises (e.g., Bury and Luckenbach 2002, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014a, USFWS 2015, Berry and Murphy 2019). Vehicle-oriented visitation is exceptionally high, ranging from &gt;50,000 to 86,550 between 2008 and 2018 annually in some regions of the Mojave Desert (USBLM 2019). Other parts of the desert and critical habitat are also experiencing growing numbers of visitors. Deaths of desert tortoises from road kills and shooting is higher in areas with high levels of vehicle-oriented visitation (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.2 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: war, civil unrest &amp; military exercises<br/>&#160; a. World War II and subsequent. Military manoeuvres across substantial areas of habitat in the western Sonoran and eastern Mojave deserts to train troops using tanks and other vehicles for the war in North Africa. Since the 1960s, military manoeuvres with armoured vehicles in extensive areas in the western, southern, and central Mojave deserts; aerial bombing training in limited areas in the western Sonoran Desert.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Military manoeuvres in 1942 resulted in severely degraded habitat (compacted soils, damaged desert pavements, altered vegetation, including forage available for desert tortoises. Lands disturbed in 1942 have not recovered after 60 years (Prose 1985, 1986; Prose and Wilshire 2000). Similar disturbances have occurred and continue to occur in tortoise populations and habitat at military installations in the southern and central Mojave Desert. In the early 2000s, expansion of the Fort Irwin military installation in the central Mojave Desert caused loss and degradation of 760 km<sup>2</sup> of tortoise habitat and <em>ca</em>. 304 km<sup>2</sup> of the lost habitat was part of critical habitat (USFWS 2010, Berry and Murphy 2019). An estimated <em>ca</em>. 300 km<sup>2</sup> will be lost with additional, ongoing expansion of the same base. The western expansion of the Marine Corps base at 29 Palms caused hundreds of tortoises to be translocated and habitat lost in the southern Mojave Desert (USDD 2017).<br/><br/>6.3 Work and other activities: law enforcement, illegal immigrants, species research, vandalism<br/>&#160; a. Border patrol agents and illegal immigrants travel cross-country by foot and vehicle in tortoise habitat in the southern border range. Vandalism, specifically wanton shooting or killing of tortoises has affected some populations more than others, probably associated with higher visitor use and vehicle-oriented recreation.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, moderate severity. Border patrol agents travel north from the border into tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, to apprehend illegal immigrants. Vehicle travel can occur off dirt roads, widen existing roads, and create new disturbances. Shooting tortoises, running over them deliberately with vehicles, or otherwise killing them has been documented in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>7.1.1 Fires &amp; fire suppression<br/>&#160; a. Caused by lightning, car fires on highways or roads, arson.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, severe, with the severity dependent on the critical habitat unit or protected area. Mojave and Colorado Desert habitats did not evolve with fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Fires increased in numbers, frequency, and amounts burned with the invasion and proliferation of non-native grasses which are highly combustible (Berry and Murphy 2019). Fires have occurred throughout the geographic range and have burned significant amounts of critical and other protected habitats in the southern, central, eastern and northeastern Mojave Desert regions. Once habitat burns, it is likely to burn again with higher frequencies and with potentially increased biomass of non-native annual grasses. Tortoises die in these fires or are injured, but some survive (Berry and Murphy 2019). Loss of cover of shrubs and food supply for the tortoises is severe in most burned areas. When fires are very hot, the seed bed may be damaged or destroyed. The most severely burned protected habitat is in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve with &gt;30% burned as of summer 2020 (McLuckie <em>et al</em>. 2021); the Mojave National Preserve also experienced a major fire and loss or degradation of 7% of the critical habitat unit in summer 2020 (Darby <em>et al</em>. 2021). <br/><br/>7.2.8 Abstraction of ground water<br/>&#160; a. For agriculture, primarily, followed by urban and cities.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, long-term degradation of habitat adjacent to cities, towns, industrial and agricultural developments. Depletion of the ground water table causing subsidence and formation of fissures has occurred in at least one part of the western Mojave Desert and in the northeastern Mojave Desert in the Las Vegas Valley in what was once desert tortoise habitat (Berry 1984, Burbey 2002). In the western Mojave Desert, the water table was depleted by agricultural uses (cotton, alfalfa) and now with solar energy development; and by cities in the Las Vegas Valley by depleted associated aquifers. Other regions have and continue to experience depletion of the water table in areas with agriculture and desert cities, e.g., adjacent to the Mojave, Colorado, and Virgin rivers (Stamos <em>et al</em>. 2001). Water is sought from sources and regions outside desert tortoise habitat (e.g., the Colorado River) to support cities and towns, as well as agriculture, because existing water tables are insufficient to support them.<br/><br/>8.1.2 Invasive and other problematic species, genes &amp; diseases: Named species<br/>&#160; a.&#160;<em>Bromus madritensis </em>ssp<em>. rubens, B. tectorum, Schismus </em>spp<em>., Erodium cicutarium, Hirschfeldia incana, Brassica tournefortii.<br/></em>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation of the Mojave and western Sonoran ecosystems. Landscape conservation forecasting (Provencher <em>et al</em>. 2011) quantified the pervasive abundance of annual brome grasses that foster destructive wildfires of a size and intensity far greater than the fire regime with which Mojave Desert habitats developed over the past millennia.&#160;In addition to supporting fires, the non-native grasses compete with native forage species of forbs required by tortoises to grow, reproduce, and remain healthy. Non-native grasses and forbs dominate the ecosystem in biomass in both wet and dry years in many tortoise habitats (Brooks and Berry 2006, Berry 2014b). Non-native grasses are not nutritious plants for tortoises to eat and cause weight loss and can cause death in juveniles (Hazard <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The awns of <em>Bromus</em> also can injure tortoise mouths. The non-native <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em> and especially <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, introduced through agricultural development, also compete with native forage species, changing the composition of the native flora (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b). They are not eaten by tortoises and can be high in oxalates, potentially a source of oxalosis in tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>8.1.2 Diseases. Named species<br/>&#160; a. Infectious diseases: <em>Mycoplasma agassizii, M. testudineum, </em>Testudinid herpesvirus 2 (TeHV2); Non-infectious diseases: oxalosis, gout, starvation, dehydration.<br/>&#160; b. Infectious diseases: ongoing, severe in some areas. The two species of <em>Mycoplasma</em> are infectious pathogens. The first (<em>M. agassizii</em>) was discovered in wild populations in 1989 and the second (<em>M. testudineum</em>) a few years later (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2014). These pathogens are spread by contact between tortoises cause disease and death in some populations, and inhibit olfaction necessary for foraging (Jacobson and Berry 2012, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Mycoplasma agassizii</em> is common in captive desert tortoises, more so than in wild populations. Epidemiological studies indicate that the distribution of the two species differs, and that tortoises with antibody-positive tests for the diseases occur closer to human habitations rather than more distant (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mycoplasmosis has been implicated as a major contributor to a catastrophic die-off of tortoises at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2020b). It is also associated with declines in other parts of the geographic range (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160; Non-infectious diseases of known etiology include oxalosis, gout, and starvation and dehydration (Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Some individuals and populations have been negatively affected by these diseases.<br/><br/>8.2.2 Problematic Native Species<br/>&#160; a. The Common Raven (<em>Corvus corax)</em>, an uncommon to rare resident between the 1920s and 1940s in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts, is now an abundant predator in ecosystems where the Desert Tortoise lives.&#160;Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>) is another similar predator, and Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) can also be a hyper-predator.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe and negative effects on population structure; loss of juveniles and immature tortoises. Populations of the Common Raven have grown enormously, supported by subsidies of food, water, perch and nest sites available from humans (Boarman 1993, Boarman and Berry 1995). They have been able to access formerly remote parts of the desert by relying on settlements, road kills and trash along highways and roads, and utility poles and transmission lines for perching and nesting (Knight and Kawashima 1993). Common Ravens are very effective predators on hatchling, juvenile and immature tortoises, with dozens to hundreds of shells recorded beneath perch and nest sites. They are responsible for preventing recovery in many parts of the desert by depleting young tortoise cohorts in populations that can lead to local extinctions (Kristan and Boarman 2003). Red-tailed Hawks have expanded their use areas into remote parts of the desert ecosystems, using utility poles and towers as nest sites and juvenile tortoises for food (Anderson and Berry 2019). Similarly, Coyotes are subsidized predators found in increased numbers near cities, towns, and some military installations and at times have high predation rates on tortoises (Esque <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>8.4.2 Problematic Species/ Diseases: Named Species<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Several non-native species of tortoises and turtles carrying disease or potentially carrying disease have been released illegally into Desert Tortoise habitats, e.g., African Spurred Tortoise (<em>Centrochelys</em> <em>sulcata</em>; Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018) and Central Asian Steppe Tortoise (<em>Testudo horsfieldii</em>; Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe. Releases of tortoises, whether native or non-native are illegal in large parts of the geographic range. Nevertheless, introduced, non-native turtles and tortoises such as the African Spurred Tortoise and Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise have been found to carry new diseases that would negatively affect already declining <em>G. agassizii </em>populations (Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018). The African Spurred Tortoise can do damage to habitat and to the native tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, because of the large size and aggressive nature. One Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise was captured in the Central Mojave Desert with a new herpesvirus not previously described in <em>G. agassizii&#160;</em>(Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The concern is that this non-native tortoise may have transmitted the new herpesvirus to desert tortoises. New, non-native herpesviruses from other species and countries and continents are a threat to health in already declining <em>G. agassizii</em> populations.<br/><br/>8.5 Viral/Prion-induced Diseases<br/>&#160; a. Herpesviruses are implicated in illness and mortality in tortoises.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe if coupled with other stressors. Herpesviruses are a threat to health and survival of desert tortoises, especially those herpesviruses introduced from other, non-native species to the desert. Tortoises with clinical signs of the disease were among populations that severely declined between the 1990s and 2000s; herpesvirus may have contributed in some areas (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Testudinid herpesvirus 2 was first identified in captive tortoises, then confirmed in wild <em>G. agassizii</em> (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The estimated prevalence of this herpesvirus for captive and wild tortoises from the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts ranged from 15 to 56% (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>8.6 Diseases of Unknown Cause<br/>&#160; a. Shell diseases, i.e., cutaneous dyskeratosis, necrosis.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. A novel shell disease, cutaneous dyskeratosis and shell necrosis, was implicated in illness and deaths of Desert Tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1994; Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2001) and a decline of ca. 80% in a once-robust population. Other populations in critical habitats appear to be affected similarly. This is a metabolic disease with lesions of the shell and integument as outward manifestations. The causes are suspected to be toxicants (e.g., elemental toxicants and/or nutritional deficiencies). The disease is implicated in elevated death rates in adult tortoises in the western Sonoran Desert and eastern Mojave Desert (Berry and Medica 1995, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>9.2.2 Industrial &amp; military effluents<br/>&#160; a. Seepage from mining.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, unremediated regionally. There are links between some diseases in tortoises and toxicants from mining and other similar developments. Tortoises dying of upper respiratory tract disease caused by <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp. in the western Mojave Desert in close proximity to a mining district had high levels of mercury in livers compared to tortoises without the disease (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991). Ill tortoises with high levels of arsenic occurred in an area mining district with high levels of mercury and arsenic (Selzer and Berry 2005). Waste from the mines was transported by wind and water to distances of 15 km (Chaffee and Berry 2006; Kim et al. 2012, 2014). Mines in other tortoise habitat in different desert regions have yet to be examined.</p><p>9.4 Garbage &amp; Solid Waste<br/>&#160; a. Trash is a threat to tortoises because they can consume it or become entangled.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, low to moderate. Consumption of trash can lead to illness and death (Donoghue 2006, Walde <em>et al</em>. 2007). Balloons and other trash are common throughout the desert and most abundant near human habitations, along roads, and recreation use areas (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, 2014a; Keith <em>et al</em>. 2008). Trash attracts predators—Common Ravens, Coyotes, and other canids—thus creating an additional risk to tortoises.<br/><br/>9.5 Air-borne Pollutants<br/>&#160; a. Pollutants such as atmospheric nitrogen and increases in CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the growth of invasive grasses and thus fire.<br/>&#160; b. Atmospheric nitrogen from urban or other areas is transported to deserts and tortoise habitat, and deposited on soils, thus enhancing growth of non-native grasses and plants prone to fire (Brooks 2003, Rao and Allen 2010).<br/><br/>11.1 Habitat Shifting &amp; Alteration<br/>&#160; a. Desertification; degradation of vegetation, soils, and topography<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Throughout the geographic range, most, if not all, tortoise habitats have received (and continue to receive) one or more anthropogenic uses and activities resulting in compacted or eroded soils and alteration of the natural structure and composition of annual and perennial vegetation (e.g., Lei 2009). Long-lived shrubs and native annual wildflowers and grasses have been replaced in part with short-lived colonizers (shrubs, non-native, fire-prone grasses) typical of disturbed areas. These changes have brought fewer places to dig burrows and a reduced supply of nutritious plants to eat (Brooks and Berry 2006, Webb and Wilshire 1983). In some areas, the rich diversity of shrubs and annual plants have been replaced by a few shrub species and the annuals replaced with primarily non-native annual species (Brooks and Berry 2006).<br/><br/>11.2 Droughts<br/>&#160; a. Desert Tortoises require water from precipitation and a diverse diet of native annuals to grow, reproduce and survive.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, increasingly severe with reduced survival throughout the geographic range, often associated with hyper-predation by coyotes. Although the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts are typified by droughts often lasting more than a year, tortoises have adaptations to cope. However, tortoises die of starvation and dehydration during prolonged droughts (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2002, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003, Longshore <em>et al</em>. 2003, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014). Juveniles are especially vulnerable. With climate change and warming, droughts, including megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, are predicted to occur in coming years (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2017, Steiger <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>11.3 Temperature Extremes<br/>&#160; a. Tortoises are able to withstand the extremes of temperature experienced in the desert; however, increases in warm temperatures coupled with drying and changes in precipitation patterns present high risks to the species.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing and a growing issue, with climate change having negative impacts throughout the geographic range. Tortoises cope with the extremes of summer and winter temperatures (and lack of water, see 11.2) by using deep burrows and restricting above-ground activities and reproduction during drought. As temperatures rise with the rise in CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, tortoises will need to find habitats where deeper burrows can be excavated. At the higher temperatures, the spring season for foraging on ephemeral annuals and egg laying is likely to be shortened, reducing the time for eating, growing, and egg production. Sex of tortoises is determined by temperature of incubation in nests, with females produced at the higher temperatures and males at the lower temperatures. Eggs laid in nest that will experience the high temperatures of summer may be predominantly female, and if temperatures are excessive, may not be viable. Although the species could survive at higher (and cooler) elevations, the habitat in mountain ranges will be more limited, steep, rocky, with exposed bedrock in places with inadequate forage.<br/><br/>12.1 Other Threats<br/>&#160; a. Climate Change.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, see 11.2 and 11.3. Change in timing and amounts of precipitation coupled with increasing temperatures are likely to have profound negative effects on the species, further reducing available habitat (e.g., Barrows 2011). Profound changes are predicted to cause deterioration in composition, structure, diversity and biomass of trees and shrubs (Munson et al. 2016) that provide shade and cover to the tortoises. Barrows (2011) predicted that tortoises may survive if they move from the western Colorado Desert to higher elevations.&#160; However, the long-lived tortoises have strong fidelity to existing home ranges.</p>","Population estimates and trends have previously been difficult to obtain with certainty for large segments of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> populations due to their patchy distribution, difficulty of detection, and associated statistical weaknesses of population estimates. Population data have been variously documented or reviewed by Woodbury and Hardy (1948), Hardy (1976), Berry (1984, 1986, 1989), Bury and Corn (1995),&#160;Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Berry and Murphy (2019). A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;by Allison and McLuckie (2018) has demonstrated continued adult population declines in four of the five&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units and low densities in nearly all subpopulations near the minimum required to remain viable (3.9 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>Between the 1930s and early 2000s, estimates of density and trends in populations were based on demographic data, habitat condition, and anthropogenic threats from both long- and short-term study plots of varying sizes, as well as reports by government agency personnel and expert observers (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948; Hardy 1976; Berry 1984, 1989). The study plots were limited in number and did not represent the entirety of subpopulations across the geographic range (e.g., Berry 1984). The subpopulation on the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah, was federally listed as threatened in 1980 (USFWS 1980). A petition submitted by the Desert Tortoise Council in 1984 to list all wild populations in the United States was denied; the USFWS determined that listing of U.S. populations was warranted but precluded because of other higher priorities (USFWS&#160;<span style="""">1985</span>). In 1989 and 1990, the State of California and USFWS listed the tortoise as threatened (USFWS <span style="""">1989,&#160;1990;</span> California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2016). The appearance of upper respiratory tract disease and rapidly declining populations in the western Mojave and a major decline in tortoises in parts of the western Sonoran (Colorado Desert, California) associated with appearance of shell disease were additional threats to the many causes of declines (USFWS 1990, 1994, and references therein). Reflecting its concern over these declines, USFWS (1994:3) stated that: “The most serious problem facing the remaining desert tortoise population is the cumulative load of human and disease-related mortality accompanied by habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. Virtually every extant desert tortoise subpopulation has been affected by one or more of these factors.” As a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994) also designated federal critical habitat units for desert tortoises at that time.&#160;In October 2020, the California Fish and Wildlife Commission accepted a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to up-list wild desert tortoises from threatened to endangered status; California has the largest subpopulation and geographic range of the species. The petition is currently under consideration by the agency with a response estimated in 2021.<br/><br/>To better measure trends in densities of adult populations in the threatened subpopulations, the Recovery Team proposed development of a landscape scale program (USFWS 1994). At the same time, the Recovery Team also noted the importance of study plot data, because more population attributes were provided than density of adults. After experimenting with different techniques, the USFWS decided to use distance sampling and initiated a formal, range-wide program for estimating densities of adult populations in critical habitat units (USFWS 2015, and references therein).<br/><br/>In the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994), population size, viability, and sizes of protected areas were discussed. Assuming the minimum density of adults in a population was “approximately 10 adults per square mile” (equivalent to 3.9 adults/km<sup>2</sup>), the target size for protected areas (then called Desert Wildlife Management Areas) was approximately 1,000 mi<sup>2</sup> (ca. 2,590 km<sup>2</sup>). This would ensure that even at such low densities and assuming half of such large areas might support no or few tortoises, each protected area would support enough adults for a genetically minimum viable population. The Recovery Team recommended six Recovery units with 12 different populations. The updated Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011) is based on the same number of populations but configured into five revised Recovery units with 17 different monitored subpopulations.<br/><br/>Most demographic data from study plots collected from the 1930s on the Beaver Dam Slope and between 1979–1980 in California and Nevada during the spring season indicated counts of 5–64 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Berry and Murphy 2019). In describing trends between 1978 and 1990 in California, the USFWS summarized data from 10 study plots in the Mojave and Colorado deserts and reported a highly significant downward trend (USFWS 1994). Additional data for the period showed some populations with low but potentially stable densities in Nevada (Berry and Medica 1995). A review of population status (Tracy <em>et al</em>. 2004) considered updated information from the permanent study plots in California and found that population declines in the western part of the range in California continued and declines were perhaps beginning in the eastern part of the California range.<br/><br/>The current population trends are based on landscape-level assessment using distance sampling for the 11-year period between 2004 and 2014 (USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). The sampling represented all five recovery units with 16 subpopulations in critical habitat units of from 115 to 3,763 km<sup>2</sup> described in the original Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994). Joshua Tree National Park is treated as a protected area and monitored as a 17th subpopulation although not designated as critical habitat. Consistent downward trends have continued in four of the five recovery units, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 11 years. Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014; the exceptions were adult densities in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) and the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (10.2/km<sup>2</sup>) (Berry et al. 2014, 2020). Unfortunately, in July 2020, a significant part of the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve burned and tortoises were found injured and dead. The Red Cliffs subpopulation declined from 2005 wildfires and with the recent 2020 fires, there will likely be further depression in densities. The six subpopulations with increasing densities had 2.7 to 6.4 adults/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2014. However, most of the 17 populations were near or below the 3.9 /km<sup>2</sup>&#160;density of adults considered as a minimum for viable populations (USFWS 1994, 2015).",Decreasing,"The Desert Tortoise was previously considered to be a single wide-ranging species, <em>Gopherus agassizii</em>, inhabiting the Mojave and Sonoran Desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico from southern California and Arizona through Sonora and into northern Sinaloa (Stebbins 1966, 2003; Iverson 1992). The species was found to be polytypic by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2011), who split the morphologically and genetically distinct Sonoran Desert populations as <em>Gopherus morafkai</em>, the Sonoran Desert Tortoise. Further analysis demonstrated that <em>G. morafkai</em> was also polytypic and split further to separate and describe the Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise further to the south as <em>Gopherus evgoodei</em> (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Geographically restricted <em>G. agassizii</em>, the Mojave or Agassiz’s Desert Tortoise, is endemic to the United States, inhabiting southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and extreme northwestern Arizona west and north of the Colorado River (TTWG 2017, Berry and Murphy 2019). The Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai</em>, occurs in both the United States and Mexico, inhabiting Arizona south and east of the Colorado River, Sonora (including Isla Tiburón), and extreme northern Sinaloa (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2011, TTWG 2017). The Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise, <em>G. evgoodei</em>, is endemic to Mexico and occurs in southern Sonora, northern Sinaloa, and extreme southwestern Chihuahua (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016, TTWG 2017).<br/><br/>Within its geographic range, <em>G. agassizii</em> occurs in the Mojave Desert, the western Sonoran or Colorado Desert, the ecotone of the Mojave with the Great Basin Desert, and ecotones with vegetation types typical of higher elevations on the lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada, Transverse, Peninsular and desert mountain ranges (USFWS 1994). McLuckie <em>et al</em>. (1999) identified a subpopulation of <em>G. agassizii</em> east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of northwestern Arizona in which morphometric and mtDNA characteristics of the majority of the subpopulation were typically Mojavean; however, elements typical of tortoises in the Sonoran Desert were also evident. Edwards <em>et al.</em> (2015), using new genetic techniques, examined this and other nearby tortoise subpopulations, and identified hybrids (F2) in three mountain ranges near the Colorado River in Arizona. The two <em>Gopherus</em> species come in contact in limited places where Mojave Desert habitats meet Sonoran Desert habitats. The two species likely maintain largely independent taxonomic identities due to ecological niche partitioning (Inman <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species has been recorded at elevations of up to&#160;1,570 m asl (Rautenstrauch and O’Farrell 1998); however, tortoises may be found in unusual places, often transported by humans or other animals (e.g., the type specimen of <em>Xerobates lepidocephalus</em>&#160;[Ottley and Velázquez-Solis 1989] from southern Baja California, Mexico, is actually an introduced <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>[Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2011]).","Commercial take or use of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is prohibited by law, and few animals have been documented in (illegal) trade in recent decades. The evaluation of conservation status, conservation and monitoring actions for the species have generated significant financial investments in the species, supporting a range of local and visiting livelihoods. The approximate cost to develop and implement the 25-year recovery program for the Mojave Desert Tortoise was USD 100 million (USGAO 2002, Ernst and Lovich 2009, USFWS 2011, Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thirty years have passed since the federal listing of&#160; <em>G. agassizii</em> as threatened in 1989–1990, declines of breeding adults continue, and many tasks to reduce deaths, described first in 1994 (USFWS 1994), remain to be implemented (see also USFWS 2011, Reports from the Recovery Implementation Teams). If fully implemented, the recommended actions could exceed 159 million USD plus additional costs that could not be estimated in the 2011 Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011). As one of the keystone species of the Mojave Desert, <em>G. agassizii</em> plays an unquantified but substantial role in generating tourism income to regional protected areas (see Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/"">https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/</a>).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation Measures taken:<br/></strong>The first legal conservation measures for <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> came from the State of California in 1939 (California Department of Fish and Game Code 1939–1981).&#160;Additional protective regulations followed until <em>G. agassizii </em>was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 1989 (California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife 2016). Federal legislation to protect <em>G. agassizii</em> first occurred in 1980 and was restricted to the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah (USFWS 1980). In 1989–1990, <em>G. agassizii</em> was federally listed as threatened (USDI&#160;<span style="""">1990&#160;</span>and references therein). The only population of <em>G. agassizii</em> that is not protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is in the northwest corner of Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery efforts have been underway since 1990. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1994) published the first Recovery Plan in 1994, coupled with designations of critical habitat units by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994); this was followed by a revised Recovery Plan in 2011 (USFWS 2011), and regional Recovery Implementation Teams established in 2012. These teams are chaired by an employee of the USFWS Desert Tortoise Recovery Office, and are composed of federal, state, and county employees from the range of the desert tortoise, including representatives from local and national conservation and other stakeholder organizations. <br/><br/>The species is included in CITES Appendix II as part of Testudinidae spp., requiring that any commercial international trade be documented not to be detrimental to the survival of wild populations. CITES Trade records generally show very low levels of international exports of live animals; the vast majority of live traded Desert Tortoises are personal pets moving in-country with their owners, and many of the records in fact concern seizures of illegally transported specimens (CITES UNEP-WCMC trade database).<br/><br/>Conservation and recovery efforts began in the early 1970s, long before efforts of the federal actions by the USFWS in 1989–90. The Desert Tortoise Council formed in 1974-75 out of an interim recovery effort involving the four Southwestern states. This non-profit corporation was and continues to be dedicated to preserving representative populations of desert tortoises; educating the public; holding annual introductory workshops; and annual symposia to bring together representatives from government agencies, academia, and the public to learn and discuss important topics aimed at recovery of tortoise populations. The Desert Tortoise Council was instrumental in providing critical materials for federal and state listings of the species. The Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, Inc., was formed in 1974 to establish protected areas for <em>G. agassizii</em>. This non-profit organization is a land trust and mitigation bank, a source of education, and research. They were instrumental in establishing the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area and increasing its size.<br/><br/>Two preserves or protected areas exist with moderately high degrees of protection. One is the 100 km<sup>2</sup> (and increasing) Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area, which was formally designated by the U.S. Congress in 1980. It is fenced, with no vehicle access, livestock grazing, mining, or surface disturbances other than a few limited natural trails and a kiosk. The Natural Area is for wild tortoises only and populations are allowed to fluctuate naturally with no augmentation. Population density of adults throughout the Natural Area in 2011-12 was 10.2/km<sup>2</sup> (Berry et al. 2014a). The second preserve is Red Cliffs Desert Reserve in Utah (251 km<sup>2</sup>). The Red Cliffs National Conservation Area provides additional protection for federal lands within the Reserve. Several paved roads, fenced and unfenced, run through the Reserve and recreation occurs throughout (e.g., hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking).&#160;The next and lower level of protection could be described as occurring within National Parks, State Parks, and National Recreation Areas such as Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, Mojave National Preserve, Red Rock Canyon, Anza-Borrego, and Red Rocks State Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and the Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area. These parks and recreation areas have very high visitor use, unfenced paved roads, and some illegal collecting and release of captive tortoises of one or more species. <br/><br/>Twelve critical habitat units, the basis for Tortoise Conservation Areas (term defined in USFWS 2011), were designated by the USFWS (1994), and have far less protection than either the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area or the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and are subject to multiple land uses that fragment and degrade habitat and create vulnerabilities and risks to the tortoises (e.g., invasive non-native grasses and other non-native species; highways; roads; utility poles, towers, and electrical transmission lines; gas lines and fibreoptic cables; recreational vehicle use; shooting; domestic and feral dogs; cattle grazing and feral burros; mining; military installations; fire that causes degradation of habitat).<br/><br/>Seventeen monitored subpopulations in the 12 critical habitat units are contained within five recovery units which cover a total of 25,678 km<sup>2</sup>. The following information for each recovery unit and the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas reports area (km<sup>2</sup>), and density of breeding adults per km<sup>2</sup> in 2014. Western Mojave Recovery Unit: Fremont-Kramer (2,347 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Ord-Rodman (852 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Superior-Cronese (3,094 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Colorado Desert Recovery Unit: Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range (713 km<sup>2</sup>, 7.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Chuckwalla (2,818 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.3/km<sup>2</sup>), Chemehuevi (3,763 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Fenner (1,782 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Joshua Tree (1,152 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Pinto Mountain (508 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Piute Valley (927 km<sup>2</sup>, 5.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Eastern Mojave Recovery Unit: El Dorado Valley (999 km<sup>2</sup>, 1.5/km<sup>2</sup>), Ivanpah Valley (2,447 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit: Beaver Dam Slope (750 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Coyote Spring (960 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.0/km<sup>2</sup>), Gold Butte (1,607 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Mormon Mesa (844 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit: Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (115 km<sup>2</sup>, 15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2015; Allison and McLuckie 2018). The overall decline in tortoise populations in critical habitats (Tortoise Conservation Areas) between 2004 and 2014 was 32.2% (USFWS 2015). Four of the five recovery units are in a state of decline, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 10 years (USFWS 2015). Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014 (USFWS 2015).<br/><br/>Extensive research has been published in peer-reviewed journals on many aspects of natural history, general ecology, physiological ecology, reproduction, health and diseases, population attributes, causes of death, movements and home range, predators, head-starting, translocation, and many other topics, making <em>G. agassizii</em> likely the most well-researched non-marine turtle species (Lovich and Ennen 2013b). Over 400 journal articles were published as of 2018, most between 1990 and 2018, as well as hundreds of reports (see three annotated bibliographies covering almost 160 years: Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980, Grover and DeFalco 1995, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016). Some information has been integrated into recovery programs, but many of the recovery measures recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) have not been implemented as of 2020.<br/><br/>Economic relevance: The approximate cost of USD 100 million to develop and implement the first and second Recovery Plans is significant within the regulatory, scientific and local economic sectors involved and much remains to be implemented (USFWS 1994, 2011; Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Measures needed:<br/></strong>The USFWS (1994) published recommended regulations for the areas that were designated as critical habitat. They described activities to be prohibited (e.g., all vehicle activity off designated roads; all competitive and organized recreational vehicle events on designated roads; habitat destructive military manoeuvres, clearing for agriculture, landfills and other surface disturbances; domestic livestock grazing, grazing by feral burros and horses; vegetation harvest; collection of biological specimens or vegetation harvest except by permit; dumping and littering; and deposition of captive or displace desert tortoises except under authorized translocation research projects; uncontrolled dogs out of vehicles; discharge of firearms except for hunting of game between September and February. There were many other recommended management actions but few of these recommendations were adopted when critical habitat units were officially described (USFWS 1994), and others have only been partially implemented by 2020.&#160;There were also recommendations for monitoring and research. In the second recovery plan, the USFWS (2011) identified and ranked (Darst <em>et al.</em> 2013) priority actions for recovering the Desert Tortoise and established regional Recovery Implementation Teams to implement these recovery actions. These Recovery Implementation Teams identify local, regional, and range-wide actions by submitting proposals to team members for discussion and prioritization. Ultimately the proposals are submitted to range-wide Management Oversight Groups composed of state, federal, and county government agencies for review, discussion, and potential sources of funding. Some projects are successfully funded and implemented, while many recommended in 1994 remain unfulfilled.<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Conservation Actions Needed, we provide the following notes:<br/></strong>1.1. Land/water protection -&gt; Site/area protection<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Better protection of Critical habitats could ensure that populations of tortoises become stable and/or increase. Examples of protective measures included in recovery measures for the tortoise are exclusion fencing and culverts along highways and roads; reduction in populations of hyper-predators such as the Common Ravens; control and removal of newly introduced and previously existing non-native plants; and control of recreational vehicle use.<br/><br/>2.1. Land/water management -&gt; Site/area management<br/>&#160; &#160; a. The first recovery plan identified site-specific or critical habitat-specific measures to ensure protection of habitat and reduction of deaths of tortoises from anthropogenic sources (USFWS 1994). Most of these recommendations are still relevant. The Recovery Implementation Teams have provided recommendations similar to those in the first recovery plan. Many of these measures remain to be implemented. For example, in the State of California where most desert tortoise habitat and populations occur, acquisition of private land would be beneficial, because a substantial portion of habitat is in multiple private ownership. Both the USFWS and State of California recommend that developers of tortoise habitat acquire replacement habitat for habitat lost to development, and such actions have been occurring for ~20 years. Another topic and critical area that would benefit from protection is the population and hybrid zone with <em>G. morafkai</em> east of the Colorado River in Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). This small population is not protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>2.2. Land/water management -&gt; Invasive/problematic species control<br/>&#160; a. Non-native grasses (e.g., <em>Schismus arabicus</em>, <em>S. barbatus</em>, <em>Bromus tectorum</em>, <em>B. madritensis rubens</em>) and forbs (e.g., <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em>) present serious and severe problems to tortoises because tortoises are selective in the choice of forage (Jennings and Berry 2015). The non-native annuals contribute to changes in forage availability, habitat structure, and increases in fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). These non-native species thrive under disturbance and spread via roads, livestock, military maneuvers, and disturbances created by recreational vehicle use off-road (e.g., D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006). The grasses are highly combustible and fire-prone in wildlands that did not evolve with short-term fire cycles (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). The grasses also compete with native annuals used as forage by the tortoises, and the species of grasses contain little nutrition, require water to metabolize, cause weight loss in the tortoises, and can become embedded in the jaws (Medica and Eckert 2007; Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similarly, <em>Brassica tournefortii</em> competes with native species used for forage and often occurs in dense stands, inhibiting movements of tortoises (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).<br/><br/>3.2. Species management -&gt; Species recovery<br/>&#160; a. Species management and recovery are guided by the Recovery Plan and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On-the-ground management is by the administering agency, e.g., U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Department of Defense, States (for state land), and private owners. That being said, much can be done by implementing actions recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) and by restoring degraded habitat (e.g., Abella and Berry 2016); controlling recreation vehicle use off-road and reducing fragmentation of habitat; limiting spread of invasive, non-native grasses and forbs; controlling hyper-predation in common ravens (USFWS 2008)&#160;and coyotes; preventing dogs and dog packs from running loose in the desert; and acquiring habitat.<br/><br/>4.3. Education &amp; awareness -&gt; Awareness &amp; communications<br/>&#160; a. See Conservation Actions in Place. Expansion of on-going programs to prevent take or shooting in the wild and release of captive tortoises of several species.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Research Needed, we provide the following notes:</strong></p>While research on some topics is desirable, more is known about <em>G. agassizii </em>than most other reptiles (Lovich and Ennen 2013b, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016 and references therein). Instead, implementation of previously identified actions to protect populations and habitat is more critical, specifically actions that will reduce deaths and loss or degradation of habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>1.1. Research -&gt; Taxonomy<br/>&#160; a. Genetic relationships between and within populations: human-mediated translocations of tortoises have occurred for decades, some authorized, some not (see Murphy et al. 2007). One recent question is the source of tortoises in Anza Borrego Desert State Park in the Colorado Desert of California. One might expect that the source would be tortoises occurring in the Colorado Desert, but instead tortoises have genotypes typical of the southwestern Mojave Desert population (Manning and Edwards 2019). More information on nearby tortoises (e.g. Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2020) occurring on the east-facing slopes of the Peninsular Range north of the Park may shed light on whether this is a naturally occurring population or a source that came from human-mediated translocations.<br/>&#160; b. Translocation of thousands of tortoises has occurred in the last &gt;20 years. Yet the only information available as to whether these translocated tortoises have been assimilated into the recipient or existing resident populations is research by Mulder <em>et al.</em> (2017) on assimilation of translocated males into the population of resident tortoises. Much more needs to be done on following males and females over a 10- to 20-year period to determine if and when adult males are assimilated into resident populations.<br/><br/>1.2. Research -&gt; Population size, distribution &amp; trends<br/>&#160; a. More information on current population attributes such as size-age class structure, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, sex ratios of adult tortoises, and causes and contributors to death is highly desirable. Landscape sampling undertaken and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Desert Tortoise Recovery Office has provided valuable region-wide information on adult densities but not on other essential population attributes (i.e., Allison and McLuckie 2018). Resurvey of long-term, mark-recapture tortoise plots has been spotty for the past 20 years while support has increased for line-distance sampling representatively and on a landscape scale (see USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). Nonetheless, it is clear (USFWS 2011) that species recovery cannot be assumed based on patterns of adult counts alone, and active work to describe vital rates across the range will be an important part of assuring tortoise populations reflect healthy population dynamics or determining regional and size-specific recovery needs.<br/><br/>1.3. Research -&gt; Life history &amp; ecology<br/>&#160; a. More information is needed on survival of neonate, juvenile, and immature size classes (first 12 to 15 years of life) and causes of mortality in the wild. Frequent input of new data on causes of and contributors to mortality for all size classes is essential for improving management of the species and for achieving upward trends.<br/><br/>1.5. Research -&gt; Threats<br/>&#160; a. The USFWS developed a model to identify major threats to the species (Darst <em>et al</em>. 2013); the information in this model is based on published research only, and not on the hundreds of reports and manuscripts available in Annual Reports to the USFWS on research permits. The model is outdated and needs major revisions to more accurately reflect available information and more recent priorities. In addition, support could be provided to speed up publication of important research projects that will lead to more protective management actions.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>3.1. Monitoring -&gt; Population trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on population attributes in critical habitat, near highways, and in critical habitat near urban areas.<br/><br/>3.4. Monitoring -&gt; Habitat trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on wildfires, non-native plants, seed beds, and recovery of preferred forage plants.<br/><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

3292503,11534,Lepidochelys olivacea,Vulnerable,A2bd,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Assessment procedure</span><br/>In accordance with the IUCN guidelines for Red List Assessments, the focus of this evaluation has been the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001). For Olive Ridleys, as with other sea turtle species, as it is not possible to survey mature individuals we used an index of abundance in the form of the number of annual nesting females. Although not all females breed every year (see section on Reproduction below) and males are not evaluated, this index is considered to be the most reliable estimator for long-term population trends of marine turtles since the proportion of the total number of females that nest in any given year and the sex ratio is believed to be fairly constant across time within and between subpopulations (Meylan 1982, Limpus 1996).<br/><br/>Direct counts of the number of nesting females (NF) are not always available so we also relied on alternative information that can be converted to NF: number of nests per season, nests/km/yr or number of protected nests per season; annual estimates of hatchling or egg production, or census estimates of nesting females from arribada rookeries. When these proxies were used, the counted units were converted to NF based on the following constants: 105 eggs/nest and 2.5 nests/season/female. Some conservation programs reported annual number of protected nests but did not include the quantity of poached or otherwise destroyed or predated nests. For these cases we extrapolated to the total number of nests based on local estimates of conservation efficiency. All conversions to NF were made under the assumptions that (a) the mean number of eggs/nest and the number of nests/female/season do not differ significantly over the timescales we have used; and (b) the effort and the coverage of the biological parameters we used are reasonably constant through the time frame evaluated. In cases where the different surveys involved different levels of coverage, explicit corrections were made and specified in the result tables.<br/><br/>In spite of the Olive Ridley being the most abundant sea turtle, available quantitative information is extremely scarce and unevenly distributed across regions. We thus relied on a subset of the world’s rookeries which, we assume, exhibit population trends that are representative of the population as a whole or, at least, for each of the regions. We selected 28 Index Sites (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below) for which reasonably long time series of quantitative data are available. They include all the largest known populations, as well as an assortment of smaller rookeries from almost all of the regions where the species is found. All sites are assumed to be demographically independent. However, although genetic data indicate a high degree of inter-rookery migration between some rookeries (e.g., Brazil-Suriname- Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (1998); between México to Central America in the Eastern Pacific- Briseño-Dueñas (1998)) the results reflect events within an evolutionary timescale (many generations). Within the time span relevant to the assessment (two to three generations), available evidence suggests significant demographic independence between the pairs of rookeries in question (e.g., mark-recapture in Nancite and Ostional indicate the vast majority are different turtles- reviewed by Bernardo and Plotkin (2007); absence of exchange by tagged turtles and non-overlapping nesting seasons Brazil vs Suriname/French Guiana- de Silva et al. (in press); and the lack of re-colonization of depleted arribadas in Jalisco and Guerrero in México by the very large Escobilla rookery, 500 to 1,000 km distant in over four decades).<br/><br/>The population abundance estimates were based on raw data or on extrapolations from regressions performed on available data. As the relatively data-rich trends consistently indicated exponential trajectories we relied on these as the method of choice for extrapolations. Some data sets contained a number of trajectories across the time frames employed and in these more than one regression was employed or a combination of regressions and raw data. We have constrained our back extrapolations to time spans close to known historical events that are believed to have defined major abundance changes in order to avoid gross exaggerations with no supporting evidence. This has, however, meant that in some cases the extrapolations have only been performed back two generations (40 years) and could be considered underestimates of decline.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the assessment process</span><br/>Calculations based on very different datasets obtained by different workgroups, using multiple survey methods and spanning many decades are fraught with uncertainties. A number of these could be biasing our assessment. (1) Combining abundance information for individual rookeries obtained with a number of different methodologies could provide a source of error. However, we believe that the magnitude of these errors is of minor significance to the final declines estimated. (2) Because of the assessment’s requirement for quantitative information, a very small proportion of the total known rookeries were included, and some regions are not well represented. The bias this introduces is further augmented since it is most likely that rookeries having long time series of data are also the most monitored and hence the better protected. In this case the estimates of decline will be underestimated relative to the true trends for the more numerous and less well monitored/protected rookeries. This is likely the case for regions with little (Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean) or no (entire Eastern Atlantic) representation in our assessment that contribute very little to our global decline values yet where reports with qualitative evidence indicate extensive population declines (reviewed by Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Nonetheless, although ideally a global assessment should incorporate full data from all regions to derive robust evaluations, the available information on the geographic distribution of abundances suggests that the largest rookeries are concentrated in regions with good representation and thus their inclusion will not significantly affect the global results. This is reflected at the regional level and in results for non-arribada rookeries where our sample bias will probably have caused an underestimation of true decline levels. (3) The extent of extrapolations into time past is an aspect that will undoubtedly contribute to the uncertainty of the results, particularly with scarce information. We have avoided extrapolating far beyond the oldest datasets to avoid this type of errors and thus consider that our results are conservative.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Rationale for the Red List Assessment</span>:<br/>In spite of scarcity in historical data, information from diverse sources has made it possible to evaluate a global decline for this widely distributed species over time periods ranging from decades to 2-3 generations. Striking regional differences are observed in the estimations that undoubtedly indicate far lower survival probabilities in some of the regions than what the global results would suggest.<br/><br/>There was also a stark and recurring contrast between the decline estimates for subpopulations grouped according to breeding strategy- arribada or non-arribada (solitary). The global decline rate estimated from non-arribada subpopulations (-63 to -83%) reflects a widespread low conservation status for these types of subpopulations that suggests they haven’t recovered to historical (pre 1960) levels even in regions with long-term protection programs (e.g., over four decades in México) in spite generalized increments over the last decade (Márquez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). This needs to be highlighted because rookeries with non-arribada behavior are many times more numerous than those that nest as arribadas (e.g., in México about 98% of Olive Ridley subpopulations are non-arribada). Yet, as their abundances are up to three to four orders of magnitude smaller than arribada rookeries, they have an insignificant influence on the global decline estimates. In fact, the global net decline for the Olive Ridley is driven principally by population trends in just two arribada populations, Escobilla (México) and Ostional (Costa Rica), both in the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>The global decline value estimated on the basis of estimated population reductions of the annual number of Olive Ridley nesting females at subpopulations in the Index Sites used ranged between 31 and 36% (see Table 3 in the Supplementary Material, see below). As most of the back extrapolations were limited to two generations it is likely that this value is conservative.<br/><br/>When deciding whether to apply Red List decline criterion A1 (the causes of reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased) or A2 (the causes of reduction may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible) to obtain decline thresholds for the listing process three characteristics of the species’ decline need to be analyzed (SPWG 2006): (1) is the reduction reversible?, (2) are the causes of the reduction identified and understood?, and (3) have the threatening factors ceased? Since the decline estimated is driven by result from arribada rookeries, the questions need to be addressed against what is known for these types of populations. While it would appear that the elimination of large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley for leather and local consumption has allowed for the stabilization of a significant portion of rookeries, particularly in the Eastern Pacific and in particular facilitated the growth of arribada rookeries such as Escobilla and Ostional, the population growth of Mismaloya, Tlalcoyunque and Chacahua in the same region and under similar conservation circumstances remain at reduced abundances well below an arribada category. This could indicate that under some circumstances, the reduction of arribada rookeries below a certain level can make it impossible or unlikely for it to recover an arribada behavior. The major cause for the reduction in the species is thought to have been the massive commercial over-exploitations, particularly in the Eastern Pacific. Furthermore, we do not yet fully understand nor are able to manage other stressors, some intrinsic or at least due to interactions between the overcrowding of growing populations that equally provoke dramatic declines in arribadas such as that of Nancite in spite of decades of protection (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Though commercial exploitation of Olive Ridleys for international markets has effectively been eliminated, at local levels significant factors continue to impact individual rookeries such as excessive egg exploitation (e.g., Isla Caña, Panama) or bycatch (such as in Orissa, India). These examples indicate that Olive Ridleys, under current circumstances, do not meet all of the conditions for A1 and hence should be evaluated under criterion A2.<br/><br/>Under A2, the decline estimations obtained for the Olive Ridley Turtle at a global scale correspond to the Vulnerable IUCN Red List threshold (a decline of &gt;30% but &lt;50%.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Like most other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys display a complex life cycle, which requires a range of geographically separated localities and multiple habitats (Márquez 1990). Females lay their nests on coastal sandy beaches from which neonates emerge and enter the marine environment to continue their development. They remain in a pelagic phase, drifting passively with major currents that disperse far from their natal sites, with juveniles sharing some of the adults’ habitats (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000) until sexual maturity is reached (Musick and Limpus 1997). Reproductively active males and females migrate toward coastal zones and concentrate near nesting beaches. However, some males appear to remain in oceanic waters and mate with females en route to their nesting beaches (Plotkin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). Their post-breeding migrations are complex, with pathways varying annually (Plotkin 1994) and with no apparent migratory corridors, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometers over large ocean expanses (Morreale <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), commonly within the 20°C isotherms (Márquez 1990). In the East Pacific, they are present from 30°N to 15°S and often seen within 1,200 nautical miles from shore although they have been sighted as far as 140°W (IATTC 2004). Western Atlantic Olive Ridleys appear to remain in neritic waters after breeding (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Demographic features / Reproduction</span><br/>The species displays three modes of reproduction: arribada, dispersed nesting, and mixed strategy (Bernardo and Plotkin 2007). The first mode represents a synchronous, mass nesting behaviour that may include hundreds to thousands of females over a period of days and occurs in fewer than a dozen places worldwide. The more common form of nesting is dispersed or “solitary” with no apparent synchronicity between individual events. At some localities, a mixture of these two forms of nesting can also occur. In general, individual Olive Ridleys may nest one, two or three times per season, with approximately 100–110 eggs per clutch (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995). For this assessment we have used an average number of 2.5 nests/female/season and 105 eggs/nest. In contrast to other sea turtle species, the reproductive cycle is nearly annual (over 60% of turtles nest every year; Márquez 1990). Solitary nesters oviposit on 14 day cycles whereas arribada nesters approximately every 28 days (Pritchard 1969, Kalb and Owens 1994, Kalb 1999). Kalb (1999) found that within a nesting season solitary nesters use multiple beaches for oviposition but arribada nesters display nest site fidelity. There are extreme variations in hatching rates between nesting beaches, however, in general they are much higher in solitary nesting beaches where around 80% is common and sometimes even higher (Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). It is widely recognized that survivorship is extremely low on high-density arribada nesting beaches because of density-dependent mortality (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991) leading to hatching rates as low as 1 to 8% (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Moreover, turtles return approximately every month during a discrete nesting season (three to six months) and nests that remained intact during the previous month are again at risk when new waves of turtles crawl ashore. On solitary nesting beaches, where density-dependent mortality is not a factor, hatching rates are significantly higher (Castro 1986, Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Post-hatching survivorship is unknown and there is no information available on recruitment rates. Presumably, like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys experience high mortality in their early life stages. Juveniles are believed to occur in similar habitats as the adults (i.e,. pelagic waters) where they forage on gelatinous prey such as jellyfish, salps and tunicates (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).","Like other long-lived species, Olive Ridleys are prone to population declines because of slow intrinsic growth rate in combination with anthropogenic impacts. These can accumulate over a protracted development through various life stages, multiple habitats (nesting beaches, migratory routes and pelagic foraging zones) and vast geographic expanses.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Targeted exploitation</span><br/>Egg harvest. Olive Ridleys and their eggs have been harvested, mostly unsustainably, worldwide. However, the current impact is difficult to evaluate because of other simultaneous factors such as incidental take in commercial fisheries. Nonetheless, there is documentation of recent egg use causing declines (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). From México to Colombia, Olive Ridley eggs have been and still are used for personal and commercial use (Lagueux 1989, Arauz 2000, Campbell 2007, Cornelius et al. 2007). Laws regulating turtle egg use vary among countries, and even where laws prohibit egg use, illegal use of Olive Ridley eggs is believed to be widespread because enforcement is either non-existent or insufficient. On unprotected solitary nesting beaches (most are unprotected), egg extraction often approaches 100%. Human use of turtle eggs for consumption and domestic animal consumption historically was widespread in the Indian Ocean and continues today largely wherever Ridleys nest (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Egg use has been reported in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Pakistan and Malaysia and is believed to have caused the decline of Olive Ridleys in these countries (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Even at monitored beaches a proportion of the eggs are still lost to poaching.<br/><br/>Directed take of adults. In the East Pacific, although Olive Ridley turtle fisheries are now closed, illegal take of adult turtles still occurs widely with an unknown level of impact. There is evidence that thousands of Olive Ridleys are still taken each year along the Pacific coast of México (Frazier et al. 2007). In the West Atlantic, the direct take of adults has diminished over time to negligible levels (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). In the Indian Ocean, the use of adult Olive Ridleys and their eggs for personal use has been and continues to be widespread (Frazier 1982, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), and market-driven harvesting of eggs and females from nesting beaches are considered the greatest threat (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Personal, subsistence use of adult Olive Ridley turtles is widespread worldwide (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Olive Ridleys and/or their eggs are used along the entire coast of West Africa (including Macaronesia) and sold in local and regional markets (Fretey 2001).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bycatch in fisheries</span><br/>The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys occurs worldwide in trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seines, gill net and other net fisheries and hook and line fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The impact of the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in fisheries has been well documented for some regions but not for others. In some locations where by-catch statistics are unavailable from fisheries, cause and effect has been used to implicate a fishery in the decline of Olive Ridleys. The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in the shrimp trawl fishery in the western Atlantic, is believed to be the main cause of the significant population decline observed there since the 1970s and currently the number of Olive Ridleys by caught in trawl fisheries off the coasts of Surinam and French Guiana is believed to be approximately a couple of thousand turtles annually (Godfrey and Chevalier 2004, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Gillnets and other fishing methods in this region also capture Olive Ridleys incidentally but to a lesser extent than shrimp trawl fishery (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Bycatch in trawl fisheries off Sergipe State in Brazil is considered the most pressing threat to that population (Thomé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the eastern Atlantic, the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys by commercial fisheries is thought to be a significant threat but very little systematic data is available (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental mortality of Olive Ridleys is worst along the coast of Orissa, India with arribada Olive Ridleys gathering to nest were fishing effort is high. Every year since the early 1980s, thousands or tens of thousands of Olive Ridleys have stranded dead on the Orissa beaches, presumably as a result of incidental capture in shrimp trawls (Pandav 2000). A gill net fishery also operates in the region and contributes to the ridley mortality along this coastline. Incidental capture in fisheries is also believed to be a serious threat in the eastern Pacific (Frazier et al. 2007) where Olive Ridleys aggregate in large numbers off shore from nesting beaches (Kalb <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Kalb 1999), but the information available is incomplete (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995, NMFS/USFWS 1998). Incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in this region has been documented in shrimp trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seine fishery and gill net fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a serious threat along the coast of Central America, with an estimated annual capture for all species of marine turtle exceeding 60,000 turtles, most of which are Olive Ridleys (Arauz 1996). Recent growth in the longline fisheries of this region are also a serious and growing threat to Olive Ridleys and have the potential to capture hundreds of thousands of Ridleys annually (Frazier et al., 2007). Bycatch of Olive Ridleys is high in Indonesian tuna long-lines and shrimp trawls although mortality appears to be low (WWF Indonesia, unpublished data).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitat impacts</span><br/>Degradation, transformation and destruction of natural conditions at nesting beaches from coastal developments continue to threaten the long-term survival of many Olive Ridley rookeries. Transformation of nesting habitat comes from the construction of new aquaculture ponds, fishing harbours and tourist facilities, as well as growth of existing coastal villages which are increasing in many parts of the world within the range of the Olive Ridley, particularly along the east coast of India (Pandav and Choudhury 1999) and in some zones in coastal México to Central America (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). These impacts contribute stress directly through the loss of nesting habitat or indirectly through changes in the thermal profiles of the beach, increased light pollution (Witherington 1992) and sewage effluents.<br/><br/>Global warming has the potential to impact the habitats and ecosystems of Olive Ridley populations worldwide (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Weishampal 2004) but the specific impacts are purely speculative at this time. Most accounts have focused on the impact of global warming on incubation temperatures of eggs, which influence the sex ratio of the embryos (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Diseases and predation</span><br/>Extremely little is known about diseases and their effects on Olive Ridley abundance. The only disease identified in the literature for Olive Ridleys is fibropapilloma, a herpes-virus found in sea turtles nearly worldwide (Herbst 1994). The incidence of fibropapilloma is not believed to be high in Olive Ridleys but has been observed in Olive Ridleys nesting in Costa Rica (Herbst 1994) and in México (Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). At some individual rookeries, the predation by wild pigs and/or feral dogs can be substantial (e.g., in the Andaman Islands; Andrews et al. 2001). Infestation of developing eggs by fly and beetle larvae can cause significant mortality of embryos. In an extremely worrying case, the beetle larvae (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Omorgus suberosus fabricius</span>) has become a plague in the world’s largest arribada rookery in Escobilla, México where it is provoking steep drops in the hatching efficiency of the clutches laid, from a typical 30% for this colony (Márquez 1990) to less than 5% in some areas (López-Reyes and Harfush 2000). When combined with the relatively low hatching rates of high-density arribada beaches and the destruction of eggs laid by previous nesters, this problem could provoke the rookery’s decline.","<p>For the purposes of Red List assessments, generation length is defined as the “average age of parents” (IUCN 2001). Since this information is not available from direct observation of sea turtle species we derived a comparable value from estimates of age at which 50% of the breeders are expected to have survived, using information for age at sexual maturity and adult survival rates. An important caveat is that, while it is known that different populations of the same species can attain sexual maturity at different ages (Heppell <em>et al.</em> 2003) and therefore different values would need to be taken into account for different regions, the information is only available for a single region and we have had to assume the estimated values are generally applicable on a global scale. The only published study on growth and age for Olive Ridleys (Zug <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates a mean age at sexual maturity for North-central Pacific Ridley sea turtles of around 13 years (range of 10-18 years). We calculated the time it would take for a cohort of breeders to reach 50% of its original size from S<sup>n</sup> =50%, where <span times="""" new="""" roman="""">n is years since age at first reproduction, and S is annual survival. Solving for n, n = ln(0.5)/ln(S). As extensive estimates of annual survival rates for female nesters are only available from the better studied sister taxon, <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em>, (TEWG 2000) we used these, which have a range of 85-92% per year. Thus, n<sub>50% </sub>= 4-9 yrs and our derived average age of female Olive Ridley parents is 17-22 years. We additionally assumed that this value would be the same for male parents. For simplicity, we have used a value of 20 yrs for the species’ generation length in this assessment.</p>",Decreasing,"The Olive Ridley sea turtle has a circumtropical distribution, with nesting occurring throughout tropical waters (except the Gulf of Mexico) and migratory circuits in tropical and some subtropical areas (Atlantic Ocean – eastern central, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, western central; Indian Ocean – eastern, western; Pacific Ocean – eastern central, northwest, southwest, western central) (Pritchard 1969). Nesting occurs in nearly 60 countries worldwide. Migratory movements are less well studied than other marine turtle species but are known to involve coastal waters of over 80 countries (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below). With very few exceptions they are not known to move between ocean basins or to cross from one ocean border to the other. Within a region, Olive Ridleys may move between the oceanic and neritic zones (Plotkin <em>et al.</em> 1995, Shanker <em>et al</em>. 2003) or just occupy neritic waters (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Most of the conservation actions on behalf of the Olive Ridley at national and international levels have been based on the species’ listing under the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Endangered </span>category in the IUCN Red List. As an Appendix I species under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) the international trade of skins from the species, which fuelled the large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley from the 1960s into the 1980s was effectively halted. Other relevant international instruments that list the Olive Ridley as threatened and hence obligate its conservation by member states include: the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC). CMS-promoted Memoranda of Understanding for the conservation and management of marine turtles and their habitats have been signed by the Olive Ridley’s range states in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (known as IOSEA) as well as in other regions such as the Atlantic Coast of Africa under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa where 21 out of 26 range states participate.<br/><br/>On the basis of the species’ classification in the IUCN Red List or in national endangered species lists, local legislatures of range states confer protection to the Olive Ridley. Although this sanctions law-enforcement, the implementation remains patchy at the global scale because of paucity in enforcement capabilities. Successful conservation has usually relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local and non-governmental organizations incorporating public outreach. Statutory use and enforcement of the Turtle Excluder Devices in the shrimp trawlers has also proven critical in some areas with high levels of interaction with this fishery.<br/><br/>Despite the legislative efforts to protect the Olive Ridley, human impacts continue to be significant. In some areas (such as West Africa and South East Asia), extensive monitoring needs to be implemented to identify regions and stressors requiring priority actions. Bycatch and illegal take particularly from the coastal, artisanal fisheries need to be evaluated through adequate on-board observer programs and properly addressed. The beetle infestation of the Escobilla rookery must be adequately evaluated and acceptable measures of biological control of the insect need to be implemented.

9306908,21652,Testudo kleinmanni,Critically Endangered,A2abcd+3d,2003,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species was previously assessed as Endangered. However, northeastern populations that were previously assigned to <em>T. kleinmanni</em> recently have been accepted as a separate species (Perälä 2001). The species'  extent of occurrence covered an estimated area of 123,610 km²  less than three generations ago. Today it is estimated at around 16,600 km².  Within the same period population sizes are estimated to have reduced by over 85% from around 55,600 to 7,470 individuals, of which approximately 5,000 are mature individuals. This figure is less than the number of animals recorded from the illegal pet trade in the 1990s alone. Fairly good habitat patches still exist in Libya but the global population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> could realistically face extinction in less than 20 years or around one generation if degradation of landscape and trade cannot be stopped.","<em>T. kleinmanni</em> populations in northern Egypt are historically associated with desert and semi-desert habitats characterized or dominated by compact sand and gravel plains with scattered rocks and shallow sandy wadis, although populations were also known to occur in or adjacent to coastal salt marsh habitats (Lortet 1887, Baha El Din 1994). The majority of the species' primary habitats in Egypt are currently severely degraded, or already completely destroyed (Baha El Din 1994). 
<br/>
<br/>In Cyrenaica, northeastern Libya, the species occurs in shrubby sand and stone desert habitats (coast) and semidesert habitats with Artemisia association (further inland), according to Schleich (1987, 1989). Schleich <em>et al.</em> (1996) consider the species to occupy generally the margins of sandy, or dry stony, habitats. <em>T. kleinmanni</em> can apparently also be found (together with <em>Testudo graeca</em> species complex tortoises) in more vegetated Mediterranean subtropical shrub evergreen forests, as can be inferred from Schleich (1989) who cites Suluntah as a locality. It is however not clear how typical this habitat association is for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in northeastern Libya, thus it is probably most appropriate to describe the species' primary habitat preference in Cyrenaica as Mediterranean scrub. Habitats are still in fairly good condition in Libya, but there are signs of extensive overgrazing in many parts, particularly in Cyrenaica, and ploughing for growing cereals is a common practice, and trends and plans for habitat utilization are unclear (S. Baha El Din 2002). According to fieldwork by A. Pieh (pers. comm.), in Cyrenaica habitat is locally still very good near Suluntah, and reasonably well preserved in the wadi system near Darnah. However, habitat on the whole coastal stretch between Darnah and Tubruq is severely degraded possibly due to extensive, and continuing, nomadic activity in that area. In Tripolitania habitat degradation due to human expansion is very evident on the coast east of Al Khums around Leptis Magna, whereas habitat in more southerly areas towards the inland near Gharyan ""looks better"" (A. Pieh, pers. comm.). Further, according to Pieh (pers. comm.), the coastline between Al Khums and the Tunisian border features occasional spots of undisturbed habitat.","In addition to agricultural (including overgrazing), developmental and industrial pressures, <em>T. kleinmanni</em> was very heavily affected by the (eventually illegal) national and international pet trade that began using the Libyan stock after Egyptian subpopulations were harvested to extinction (Baha El Din 1994). The brochure of Tortoise Care (The Egyptian Tortoise Conservation Program) (Anonymous 2000) as well as S. Baha El Din (2002) list the illegal trade in <em>T. kleinmanni</em> of Libyan origin within Egypt as continuing. Trade in <em>T. kleinmanni</em> also exists within Libya itself (Fritz and Buskirk 1997; Pieh. pers. comm.; S. Baha El Din 2002), with potentially devastating consequences for the remaining world population. According to locals, collection pressure is higher in the east than in the west. Tortoises have a low annual biomass production resulting in a high degree of sensitivity to population disturbance and consequent poor recovery abilities from such activities as trade collection (Iverson 1982).","Currently, the species is effectively extinct within Egypt. Baha El Din (1994) surveyed the whole former range of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in Egypt and concluded that the species disappeared completely within a period of approximately 10 to 20 years (between the early 1970s and the early 1990s). This time frame is estimated to represent around, or slightly more than, one generation length for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, taking into consideration that maturity is probably reached at about 10-20 years in the wild as is the case in several other species of testudinids living in semiarid or arid conditions (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Brushko 1977, review in: Kuzmin 2002). In 2001, two wild tortoises were found in a protected coastal area in the Western Desert, the first record for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in Egypt in over twenty years (M. Baha El Din 2002). This finding, although significant <em>per se</em>, does naturally nothing to change the fact that <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is effectively extinct in Egypt. 
<br/>
<br/>The species can still be found in  two distinct, and geographically disjunct regions in Libya (Tripolitania and Cyrenaica).
<br/>
<br/>Judging by data produced in Iverson (1992), Buskirk (1985) and Baha El Din (1994), the species' extent of occurrence in Egypt, possibly up to the early 1970s, is estimated as having been around 67,860 km². According to available data (Buskirk 1985, Iverson 1986, 1992, Fritz and Buskirk 1997, Perälä 2001, Pieh, pers. comm.), the small northwestern (Tripolitanian) range encompasses an estimated extent of occurrence of around 5,500 km². Nothing is known about local population densities but A. Pieh (pers. comm.) concluded <em>in situ</em> that the coastal subpopulation has to be severely fragmented because of a mosaic of badly degraded habitat. The estimated extent of occurrence for present Cyrenaican population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is around 11,100 km², as measured using a minimum convex polygon and locality data provided by S. Baha El Din (2002), and Pieh (pers. comm.). Some 40 years ago the Cyrenaican <em>T. kleinmanni</em> population had possibly an estimated extent of occurrence of 50,250 km² as calculated using data from Buskirk (1985), Iverson (1992), and Perälä (2001), as well as assuming that the distribution was continuous from Cyrenaica to western Egypt. The isolated locality of ""Sirtica"" (Loveridge and Williams 1957) some 300 km west of Qaminis (Gheminez) in western Cyrenaica was not taken into account.
<br/>
<br/>Because no fieldwork based data on the area of occupancy exist for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, the area of occupancy is  defined as 10% of the area of extent of occurrence, yielding estimations of total past area of occupancy 12,361 km² and total present area of occupancy 1,660 km².
<br/>
<br/>20 years ago, Mendelssohn (1982) estimated  the global population size of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> (including <em>T. werneri</em> from Sinai and Israel) at less than 10,000 individuals, including immature tortoises. This figure seems to be an underestimation regarding current estimates and statistics on trade. Mendelssohn (1982) also was not aware of the existence of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in northwestern Libya, which was therefore not taken into account in his assessment. Although no population density assessments based on local field data have been published for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in mainland Egypt and Libya, densities are thought to be very low (Buskirk 1985, Schleich 1989, Baha El Din 1994, M. Baha El Din 2002, S. Baha El Din 2002, A. Pieh, pers. comm.). Locals in Libya stated in April 2002 that populations of the species still exist in many parts of Cyrenaica, but that they have declined notably in recent years due to collection (S. Baha El Din 2002). Perälä (2002) estimates the past total world population at 55,624 individuals, substantially more than the estimate by Mendelssohn (1982). The total present world  population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is estimated at 7,470 individuals (Perälä 2002), which  is considerably less than the number of recorded animals collected in Libya for the pet trade in the 1990s. Out of the existing global population around 75% (5,000 individuals) would be mature adults if Mendelssohn's (1982) data on population structure for <em>T. werneri</em> is applicable for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>. According to the above estimate, the global population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> would have declined by 86.6% (or by 48,152 individuals) in less than three generations. Out of these, at least 10,680 individuals have been recorded from the illegal pet trade in the 1990s alone (Baha El Din 1994, Ventura 1995, Pieh, pers. comm.). Because relatively good habitat still exists in Libya it is possible that the earlier inferred reduction in the extent of occurrence  primarily reflects pressure from collection and illegal trade, rather than habitat degradation (in Libya).",Decreasing,"Populations east of the Nile delta in Egypt and in Israel formerly assigned to <em>T. kleinmanni</em> have been shown to encompass a separate species <em>Testudo werneri</em> (Perälä 2001). Consequently, this assessment does not take into account information based on the above geographical region traditionally incorporated into papers on <em>T. kleinmanni</em> (Perälä 2002). <br/> <br/>Historically, the range of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> runs along the Mediterranean coastal strip up to about 90-120 km, exceptionally further, towards inland in Libya (where disjunct populations exist in Tripolitania and in the Cyrenaican Peninsula) and more or less continuously from northeastern Libya to the Western Desert and the north coast in mainland Egypt (Lortet 1883, 1887, Loveridge and Williams 1957, Buskirk 1985, Iverson 1986, 1992, Baha El Din 1994, Fritz and Buskirk 1997, Perälä 2001). The range has possibly been much greater in the past, and localities further inland or in the west, such as Siwa Oasis and the Tripolitanian range respectively, may represent the last remnants of a more extensive distribution in historical times which could have decreased with the natural aridification and expansion of the Saharan desert. Thus <em>a priori</em> treatments of isolated occurrences of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> as human introductions, or as extralimital, should be viewed with caution.",,Terrestrial,"Whereas <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is covered by international conservation policies (the species is included in CITES Appendix I), and although it is protected by Egyptian law (Baha El Din 1994; Anonymous 2000), the species is unprotected in Libya (Anonymous 2000; S. Baha El Din 2002). However, recent information (M. Baha El Din 2002; S. Baha El Din 2002) suggests that the Libyan Environment General Authority and local academics show interest for tortoise conservation in Libya, and that they are looking forward to cooperating with the Egyptian based TortoiseCare program. Despite protection of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> by law in Egypt, the law is not implemented at all times (Baha El Din 1994; Anonymous 2000). S. Baha El Din (2002) indicates that TortoiseCare will continue to seek funding for future activities for the conservation of <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, and particularly for the development of a species action plan that takes into consideration the conservation needs of the species on a global level, including both Egypt and Libya.  <br/> <br/>Populations from Sinai and Israel, attributed traditionally to <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, were shown to comprise a separate species (Perälä 2001). However, the limited data available suggest that the geographically isolated subpopulation of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> from Tripolitania might additionally be taxonomically distinct. It is essential that local subpopulations are not mixed in any circumstances, including possible breeding projects, whether in or ex situ. The use of captive or confiscated stock of unknown origins or parentage in conservation programs should be discouraged at all times for the same reasons. <br/> <br/>Data for uses and harvest levels are largely known for Egypt only (Baha El Din 1994) where monitoring is continuing (Anonymous 2000). No data are available for Libya. <br/> <br/>Conservation measures are going on in Egypt (M. Baha El Din 2002) but not yet in Libya. More research is needed also in Egypt, such as a systematic search and identification of habitat pockets where tortoises might still exist. <br/> <br/>Protected areas exist in Egypt, including the one in which two individuals were recently found, and more are needed according to Baha El Din (1994), Anonymous (2000) and M. Baha El Din (2002). The motives for establishing new protected areas especially for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> are not entirely clear as the species is already effectively extinct in Egypt. Reintroduction projects have been currently stalled in Egypt (M. Baha El Din 2002). <em>T. kleinmanni</em> may occur in Kouf National Park in NE Libya (Schleich 1987) where one specimen was found 20 years ago (FMNH collection data). Other Libyan reserves in areas of tortoise activity are nonexistent (S. Baha El Din 2002).

The two islands of Cayos Cochinos are so geographically close and experiencing the same threat pressures they are considered as one location. Main threats to the iguana are habitat loss, harvesting of adults and eggs for human consumption, invasive alien species, and collecting for the international pet trade. The mainland subpopulation has declined precipitously in recent years due to these threats. Although there are threats of concern, the Cayos Cochinos subpopulation appears relatively stable at present and contains a greater number of mature iguanas than found on the mainland. As long as the Cayos subpopulation remains stable, the species as a whole does not qualify for listing as Critically Endangered under the A criterion.

This species is now considered rare globally, with local densities negatively correlated with fishing pressure across six Indo-Pacific locations, and with suspected local extinctions at some localities (Dulvy and Polunin 2004).  Underwater surveys across its range in suitable habitats, even at remote localities, have either failed to detect this species or have detected only rare individuals (Dulvy and Polunin 2004, T.J. Donaldson unpublished data of timed ""long-swim""/gps transects). Otherwise, it is abundant only on the Great Barrier Reef and at Rowley Shoals in northwestern Australia; juvenile <em>B. muricatum</em> appear to be very rare in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Bellwood and Choat 1989) but adults achieve their highest abundance on the Great Barrier Reef (mean = 31 fish per hectare) over the recorded range of this species (J.H. Choat pers. comm.).  Based on rapid visual census from a series of transects of 50x5 m at depth of 12 m on individual reefs at Coringa-Herald National Nature Reserve (located east of Cairns, Australia), the abundance of <em>B. muricatum</em> was estimated to range from 1 to 25 fish in northeast and southwest Herald (Oxley <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/> <br/>Elsewhere, it is relatively abundant in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and a few other oceanic islands, and is common locally at Samoa, Sipidan Island (Malaysia), Wake Island, the Red Sea and New Caledonia. Choat and Randall (1986) described <em>B. muricatum</em> as widely distributed in West Indian and Pacific Oceans, and was most commonly observed on reef fronts, reef crests and flats. At other locations, it is now uncommon or rare, and is virtually extinct in Guam, Marshall Islands, parts of Fiji and East Africa, and is declining rapidly in Palau (Myers 1991, Donaldson and Dulvy 2004, Dulvy and Polunin 2004, Donaldson unpubl. data). This species is naturally rare  in some parts of its range (e.g., Christmas Island, Amirantes and Farqhuar Atoll, Seychelles, and elsewhere in the Indian Ocean), a fact which cannot be attributed to over-fishing.(J.H. Choat pers. comm.). <em>B. muricatum</em> was rare around most the US Pacific Islands and was seen typically only at 1 or 2 islands of a region (e.g., US Line Islands, US Phoenix Islands, Marianas Archipelago, or American Samoan Islands) (R.H. Schroeder, Coral Reef Ecosystem Division of the NOAA, pers. comms. on 14th Aug 2006; 23rd and 29th Dec 2006).  <br/> <br/>See the Supplementary Material for the fishery-independent data. No fishery-dependent data are available either regionally or by country. <br/> <br/>Donaldson and Dulvy (2004) showed that the large-sized, long-lived <em>B. muricatum</em>, but with low replacement rates and high vulnerability to fishing pressure, appears to be of considerable functional importance (as a major bioeroder on coral reefs and maintain ecosystem resilience) which should be protected. <br/> <br/>Hamilton (2003) pointed out that the introduction of simple but new technologies coupled with small scale economic restructuring (from the mid 1970s till the end of 1980s, there were no cash markets for <em>B. muricatum</em>; greater financial development in late 1980s ended up in the development of fisheries projects; by the mid 1990s, fillets of <em>B. muricatum</em> were bought at a higher price than any other fish - commercialization) of the <em>B. muricatum</em> fishery in Solomon Islands has overexploited its stock which is in need of management. <br/> <br/>As parrotfish are the only fish group capable of consuming reef carbonate, Bellwood <em>et al</em>. (2003) indicated that <em>B. muricatum</em> plays a crucial role in reef ecosystem processes, and its absence highlights the potential for marked changes in ecosystem function (shifting from steady-state reef calcification to carbonate accumulation). <br/> <br/>Dulvy and Polunin (2004) revealed that informal methods of inferring whether a species is naturally rare or has declined  or disappeared as a result of human activity could aid efforts to provide a more accurate estimate of the contemporary marine extinction rate in such data-poor situations. <br/> <br/>In the Solomon Islands, Aswani and Hamilton (2004) stated that protection of the highly fecund large females would enhance the sustainability of the Roviana fishery. <br/> <br/>Donaldson and Dulvy (2004) recommended (1) implementing a moratorium on commercial fishing and export; (2) educating stakeholders and the general public on the importance of conserving <em>B. muricatum</em>; (3) creating and enforcing larger marine reserves that incorporate key habitat; and (4) carrying further research on its population ecology and behaviour. <br/> <br/>D. Fenner (pers. comm., 22nd Oct 2006) suggested that it is important to protect and monitor <em>B. muricatum</em>, a coral predator, because its removal might have effects on coral reef ecosystem with unknown consequences. <br/> <br/>Gillett and Moy (2006) suggested that <em>B. muricatum</em> (a species that is inherently not very resilient to fishing pressure) should be a conceptual issue for consideration on the control of the fishing gear selectivity (especially selectivity of spearfishing). <br/> <br/>Russ and Alcala (1998) suggested that the small size of most marine protected areas in heavily fished regions would show little positive effects on reef-bioeroding parrotfish abundances. <br/> <br/>G.R. Allen (pers. comm. 16 January 2007) recommended blanket protection of this species, offering the ""chance for the numerous immature fish to grow and form the nucleus of the globally exceptional concentration"" of this giant reef fish. <br/> <br/>For this historically abundant species, more information on its present abundance, biology, age-and-growth and management practices is recommended before it disappears due to unsustainable exploitation. <br/> <br/>Given all the above information it seems reasonable to infer at least a 30% population reduction of the Humphead Parrotfish in the last three generations (the last 30 years) due to over-exploitation in parts of its range.","This species is gregarious and occurs in aggregations of up to several (&gt; 75) individuals on seaward and clear outer lagoon reefs at depths of 1 to 30m; also enters outer reef flats at low tide to forage. Pelagic spawning on a lunar cycle; utilises resident spawning aggregations sites (Johannes 1981, Gladstone 1986).  Eggs and larvae are pelagic. Primarily a corallivore, but also feeds upon benthic algae; this species uses its large gibbus head to ram corals and break them into pieces that are more easily ingested. Aggregations of this species are important producers of coral sand on reefs and may be important in the maintenance of ecosystem resilience (Bellwood <em>et al</em>. 2003).  Reportedly wary on reefs near human settlement or use.  This species sleeps in large groups, thus rendering them highly vulnerable to exploitation by spearfishers (mainly in the Pacific region) and netters at night (Myers 1999). <br/> <br/>Additional notes, as follows: <br/> <br/>Exposed reef crests are the primary habitat of <em>B. muricatum</em> (J.H. Choat, pers. comm. on 4th Jan 2007). <br/> <br/>In unfished areas, <em>B. muricatum</em> may enter outer reef flats at depths of 1 to at least 30 m (Myers 1991). <br/> <br/>Lieske and Myers (1994) observed that juveniles can be found in lagoons, while adults are in clear outer lagoon and seaward reefs at depths of at least 30 m. <br/> <br/>Very small individuals are restricted to the shallow inner lagoon in Solomon Islands (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>At Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, juveniles are limited to the shallow inner lagoon environment, while larger individuals occur predominantly in passages (Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/><em>B. muricatum</em> feeds substantially on live coral (Gladstone 1986, Myers 1991, Bellwood <em>et al</em>. 2003) and benthic algae (Randall <em>et al</em> 1990). <br/> <br/>Gladstone (1986) described <em>B. muricatum</em> as generally timid and difficult to approach. <br/> <br/>Bellwood et al (2003) reported that <em>B. muricatum</em> produces significant bioerosion in the Indo-Pacific.  Based on 132 timed transects (20-min long, 5 m wide) at 9 reefs in the Great Barrier Reef, schools of 30 to 50 huge (up to 120 cm TL) specimens with each individual removing 2.33 m³ or 5.69 tonnes of structural reef carbonate each year. <br/> <br/><strong>Spawning</strong> <br/>Spawning behaviour in a tightly packed school of about 100 individuals (pair spawning activities among this mobile group) was observed from the seafloor (15 m deep) to about 2 m below the surface on the morning of January 15, 1985 in Great Barrier Reef (Gladstone 1986).  None of the <em>B. muricatum</em> in the spawning school was smaller than about 60 cm TL (Gladstone 1986). Choat and Randall (1986) recorded a group spawning (40 to 50 fish) on the outer face of Yonge reef in Great Barrier Reef during December 1983. <br/> <br/><strong>Sexual Pattern</strong> <br/>Randall and Bruce (1983) had suggested sex inversion occurs in <em>B. muricatum</em>.  J.H. Choat, pers. comm., 18 September 2006) stated that this species does not appear to be diandric; there is an extended prereproductive period of sexual differentiation from which males are produced. <br/> <br/><strong>Fecundity and Recruitment</strong> <br/>Information not available","<em>B. muricatum</em> forms mixed sized schools and is extremely vulnerable to overfishing (Hamilton 2003). <br/> <br/>Shoaling and group resting behaviour render <em>B. muricatum</em> highly vulnerable to spearfishing, particularly at night-time (Donaldson and Dulvy 2004) and mainly in the Pacific region (J.H. Choat pers. comm.). Spearfishing at night has reduced the numbers of <em>B. muricatum</em> (Gladstone 1986, D. Fenner pers. comm. on 27th July 2006). <br/> <br/>In Roviana Lagoon (Solomon Islands), artisanal spear fishers use their sophisticated indigenous knowledge of the spawning behaviour and ecology of <em>B. muricatum</em> to catch as many fish as possible in a night (Hamilton 2003). <br/> <br/>The belief that <em>B. muricatum</em> predominantly aggregate at night around the new moon period and that catch rates are far greater during the new moon was not supported by field survey done in 2000-2001 (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>Dulvy and Polunin (2004) suggested that the decline of <em>B. muricatum</em> in the Lau Group in Fiji was mainly due its nocturnal aggregative behaviour in shallow lagoon water or in reef caves and the daytime foraging of shoals in depth accessible by spearfishermen. <br/> <br/><em>B. muricatum</em> was often captured for ceremonial events, indicating this species has a high cultural significant value in the Lau Island group, Fiji (Dulvy and Polunin 2004). <br/> <br/>Low priority to enforcing legislation related to spearfishing in Fiji (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>In 2001, the Samoa Fisheries Projected reported that SCUBA spearfishing activities at night had been increased rapidly in the past 12 months, in which <em>B. muricatum</em> was one of the target species (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Gillett and Moy (2006) pointed out that sleeping <em>B. muricatum</em> was one of the three main types of fish to be targeted by spearfishing.<br/><br/>Parrotfishes show varying degrees of habitat preference and utilization  of coral reef habitats, with some species spending the majority of their  life stages on coral reefs, while others primarily utilize seagrass  beds, mangroves, algal beds, and /or rocky reefs. Although the majority  of the parrotfishes occur in mixed habitat (primarily inhabiting  seagrass beds, mangroves, and rocky reefs) approximately 78% of these  mixed habitat species are experiencing greater than 30% loss of coral  reef area and habitat quality across their distributions. Of those  species that occur exclusively in coral reef habitat, more than 80% are  experiencing a greater than 30% of coral reef loss and degradation  across their distributions. However, more research is needed to  understand the long-term effects of habitat loss and degradation on  these species populations. Widespread coral reef loss and declining  habitat conditions are particularly worrying for species that depend on  live coral reefs for food and shelter especially as studies have shown  that protection of pristine habitats facilitate the persistence of adult  populations in species that have spatially separated adult and juvenile  habitats. Furthermore, coral reef loss and declining habitat conditions  are particularly worrying for some corallivorous excavating  parrotfishes that play major roles in reef dynamics and sedimentation  (Comeros-Raynal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012).<strong></strong>","<em>B. muricatum</em> are locally patchily distributed, adults always found in small shoals (&lt;= 40 individuals) (Donaldson and Dulvy 2004). <br/> <br/>Choat and Randall (1986) stated <em>B. muricatum</em> does not display sex-associated patterns of colour change, maintaining a uniform body colouration in adult females and males. Juvenile shows a distinct colour pattern. <br/> <br/>Hamilton (2003) described <em>B. muricatum</em> is the largest of all parrotfish, reaching over 50 kg and living to an age of at least 40 years. <br/> <br/>Gladstone (1986) revealed that <em>B. muricatum</em> individuals usually occur as part of schools containing 20 to almost 100 fish which often move into shallow waters during feeding around Lizard Island in Great Barrier Reef. <br/> <br/>Based on a histological analysis of gonad collected from 169 females in Solomon Islands in 2000-2001, the size of maturity was found to be 620 mm FL, in which some specimens as small as 610 mm FL showed significant gonad development (Hamilton 2003). <br/> <br/>Hamilton and Adams (unpubl. data) showed that 100% female maturity occurs at 650 mm SL. <br/> <br/>FishBase 2006 (www.fishbase.org) estimates that the minimum population doubling time ranges from 4.5 to 14 years; this estimate is derived from a formula that utilizes length and infinity (Linf), length at maximum yield (Lopt), time at length ""0"" (t0) and K (= 0.10), and may need to be recalculated given the maximum age of this species (J.H. Choat, pers. comm., 18 September 2006).  FishBase (2006) calculates that the decline threshold equals 0.85; this species is vulnerable to extinction if this threshold value is exceeded over the longer of 10 years or three generations. <br/> <br/><strong>Sex composition</strong> <br/>Information not available <br/> <br/><strong>Length-age relationship</strong> <br/>Information not available.",Decreasing,"Recorded from the Red Sea east to the Line Islands and Tuamotu Archipelago (French Polynesia), north to Taiwan, the Yaeyama Islands (Japan), and Wake Island (United States Minor Outlying Islands), south to northwest Australia, the Great Barrier Reef and New Caledonia (Randall <em>et al</em>. 1990, Myers 1999).","<strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">This species is c</strong>onsumed as food. Aswani and  Hamilton (2004) reported that divers in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands  would selectively target the largest individuals among a school of  resting <em>B. muricatum</em> so as to let the remaining fish to flee. By the mid 1990s, fillets of <em>B. muricatum</em> were bought at a higher price than any other fish in Solomon Islands (Hamilton 2003). <br/> <br/>With not much market interest for <em>B. muricatum</em>  in Palau now (Y.

The habit of sleeping in large groups making <em>B. muricatum</em> highly vulnerable to be caught by commercial spearfishermen (Myers 1991).",Marine,"Two marine protected areas (MPAs) [""no-take"" zones] were established in Baraulu Village and Nusa Hope Village, Solomon Islands in 2002 to protect <em>B. muricatum</em> and other lagoon species (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>There are no direct protective practices for <em>B. muricatum</em>. <br/> <br/><strong>Fiji</strong> <br/>The Fisheries (Restrictions on Use of Breathing (Apparatus) Regulations, 1997 ban the use of underwater breathing apparatus to ""collect, take, or dive for fish"", except for those with appointment from the Permanent Secretary or any person appointed by him in writing.  And the Sixth Schedule of the Fisheries Regulation establishes minimum sizes for 21 tpes of fish, including many that are often caught by spearfishing (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Besides, traditional fisheries rules (e.g,. a ban on night diving, and a ban on the use of SCUBA for fishing) in most of the 410 traditional fishing areas in Fiji have their own local fishing rules and many of those are applicable to spearfishing (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/><strong>Samoa</strong> <br/>The Fishing (Scuba Fishing) Regulations 2003 states no person shall scuba fish without a license (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Many different types of traditional rules (e.g., establishing small protected areas, minimun size limits, and restricting the use of underwater torches for spearfishing at night) governing fisheries exist in the 324 villages of Samoa (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/><strong>Solomon Islands</strong> <br/>Regulations 29 of the Fisheries Act, which enacted in January 2004, states ""any person using under-water breathing apparatus for the purpose of harvesting any marine resource shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or six months imprisonment or both such fine and imprisonment"" (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Many villages regulate spearfishing (e.g. bans on night diving) by themselves (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Although traditional leader's ability to manage marine resource was found to be effective in some of the tribes in Solomon Islands, the existence of non-member (e.g., institutional context) and enforcement of harvest restriction rules are crucial so as to enhance management and minimize the public contest over natural resources (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>Russ and Alcala (1998) suggested that the small size of most marine protected areas in heavily fished regions would show little positive effects on parrotfish abundances. <br/> <br/>Aswani and Hamilton (2004) suggested that the prohibition on spearfishing within passage habitats in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, would provide a measure of protection the remaining important spawning stocks of <em>B. muricatum</em> in the Indo Pacific region. <br/> <br/>Aswani and Hamilton (2004) recommended that any lunar ban on spearfishing should focus at late full moon quarter during which <em>B. muricatum</em> spawns.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species experiences a considerable range in elevation of near sea level in the south to above 2,607 m in the north at Chendebji (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wangchuk <em>et al</em>. 2003). One isolated population is found in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, Nayakgaon, in the Kokrajhar district of Assam (Medhi&#160;et al. 2004). Study of this population has shown that the animals can withstand the effects of habitat change to some extent and survive in altered habitats (Medhi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). The diet consists of young and mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits, and seeds, with most feeding spent on young leaves (Gupta 1998, 2002). Subba (1989) and Subba and Santiapillai (1989), however, found that this species prefers fruits and buds to leaves. In forest fragments they may depend on cultivated crops such as tapioca, betel, and guava. It is diurnal and arboreal (Khajuria 1977).<br/><br/>Long-term field studies show that the species spends 12.8–33% in feeding, 40–63.14%in resting, 6.29–19% in locomotion, 5–11.54% in monitoring, 2–3.7% time in playing and 0.35–6% time grooming and other social activities (Mukherjee 1996, Chetry 2002, Biswas 2004, Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). The home range of the species varies from 2 to 58 ha depending on the habitat quality (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Being a folivore the principal share of its diet is leaves, yet they consume other food item like fruits, seeds, flowers and insects on a regular basis. The species spends 60% of the time on feeding leaves, 24.6% time on fruits, 5.99% time on petiole, 2.5% on flower and flower buds, and 2.56% on stem cortex and shoot. They were also reported eating gum, soil, algae and burned wild potatoes and arium, snail (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Chirang Reserve Forest, the buffer between Manas and Ripu-Chirang Elephant Reserve, the langurs were seen to feed on <em>Cryptocoryne retrospiralis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>","<p>Due to habitat destruction, the populations of this species are restricted to fragmented forest pockets, especially in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em> 2004). Habitat destruction is the major threat to this species in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em> 2004). Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em>&#160;2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava <em>et al</em>., 2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and logging, woodcutting and domestic fuel wood collection have severely affected the habitsats of the species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2001). The political unrest, the settlement of&#160; refugee in the habitat, developmental activities , shifting cultivation, commercial logging, rubber plantation, contributed the habitat destruction of the species (Chetry <em>et al</em>., 2010).&#160; Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.</p> <p>Recorded forest cover lost during 1997-2001 has been reported in the following as Chirang Reserve Forest (593 km<sup>2</sup>) reduced to 393 km<sup>2</sup>, and&#160;Bengaltal Reserve Forest reduced to 5 km<sup>2</sup> during this period and similar trend was reported throughout the distribution range in India except in protected areas. The habitat is still under tremendous anthrpogernic pressure in the form encroachments, expansion of agricultural activities&#160;and other development activities are existing&#160;and which is expected to&#160;continue in future too.&#160;There was massive habitat loss between 1989 and 2000, which resulted in severe fragmentation into 19 pockets where the Golden Langur survived until sometime and eventually disappeared (Choudhury, 2002).</p> <p>Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for this species: “Crop plantations, grazing, harvesting non-woody vegetation for firewood and charcoal production, selective logging, timber collection, human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, trade, killed by domestic dogs, habitat loss, high juvenile mortality, inbreeding, and local trade in live animals as pets and in road shows. Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J. Das pers. comm.).&#160;Poisoning due to organochlorine insecticide is another threat to the population as witnessed in a rubber plantation in Kokrajhar, Assam (Nath and Chakraborthy, 2011).</p><p>It is suspected that the rate of decline in India is well above 60%, definitely more than in Bhutan; but given the overall disturbance in both the countries due to increasing number of development projects, damming, conversion of forests for settlements, cultivation and plantations, the destruction of habitat is on the increase and is expected to continue into the future for another two decades at least at the same rate.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>A total of&#160;5,141 individuals in 566 troops were sighted in&#160;India in mid-to-late 2000s (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ghosh <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 6,637 individual reported from Bhutan in early 2000s (Wangchuk 2003). Demographic trends indicate a decline in the population of this species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001). Groups were bigger and densities higher in areas of more degraded habitat (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001), however, owing to disturbance and felling, the langurs remained in higher densities&#160;for quite some time but currently they have totally disappeared from degraded habitats. The langurs near the National Highway such as Bismuri and other places have vanished. The high density was due to crowding from sudden habitat loss and degradation. The langurs survived for quite some time in such habitat as the local people generally do not kill for meat unlike many other areas of northeastern India (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>The population has declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years, and is expected to decline further in the near future due to various threats outlined by field biologists in both India and Bhutan (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Population densities in Manas National Park, and Ripu and Chirrang reserve forests are 8 ind/km², 46 ind/km², and 64 ind/km², respectively. The Golden Langur Conservation Project saw a rise in the langurs population across the range in India, from 1,500 in 1997 to 5,600 in 2007–2012, and in Bhutan, estimated to be 6,600 in number. Estimated range size at present is 1,506 km². The density has also significantly increased from one individual/km² to 3.71 individuals/km² in 2009. Distribution&#160;area&#160;in the protected area and outside protected area in India is 1,993 km² and in the protected areas of Bhutan is 2,992 km² (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2010). Overall there is no increase (except in some pockets) but populations have declined sharply in areas such as Chirang RF. In 1997 count, the coverage was poorer than in 2007-12, hence larger population in 2007–2012&#160;(Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019). <br/><br/>Populations of Golden Langurs in smaller fragments have lower nucleotide diversity than those in larger fragments.

It is also listed on CITES Appendix I (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). The Chakrashila Wildlife Sanctuary is the only protected habitat for this species in India (Medhi <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, Srivastava <em>et al</em>. (2001) reports that the species is also found in Ripu, Chirrang, and Manas Forest Reserves. Yet these reserves are unstable, and the complete protection of Manas National Park is needed (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). By upgrading the protection and status of this species, it is believed that isolated populations can be linked through corridors that will prevent genetic fragmentation (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). A long-term study is needed to assess the actual impact of habitat alteration on the species over long periods of time (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Medhi <em>et al.</em> (2004) suggest the following actions to protect the population of this species in Nayakgaon: insulation or diversion of electric lines, motivate villagers to restrain their dogs, planting of trees to develop a corridor between the Nayakgaon population and the Chakrashila population, a long term study of behaviour and ecology, and regular monitoring of the population. <br/><br/>Chetry and Chetry (2009) suggested habitat conservation, forested corridors linking the fragments, habitat restoration of the degraded forest, wild to wild translocation of isolated populations, community participation in forest management and trans-boundary&#160;conservation programme for the conservation of the species.

Quantitative analysis has also suggested that the population may face a  high risk of extinction under some ecologically feasible future  scenarios (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the late 1950s, the population was estimated to be over 2,000 individuals (Haimoff 1984, Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987). By 1989, the Hainan Gibbon population was thought to have been reduced to a single relict population of 21 gibbons occurring in four groups, restricted to a 16 km<sup>2</sup> patch of primary montane rainforest on Mt. Futouling within Bawangling National Nature Reserve (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989). The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fellowes <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bryant&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016).</p>","<p>This species currently occurs in montane rainforest, at altitudes ranging from 650 to 1,200 m (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005), although specimens were collected at lower elevations prior to the complete clearance of lowland forest on Hainan. It is diurnal, arboreal, and mostly frugivorous; the most difficult time for the gibbons to find food in Bawangling National Nature Reserve is between February and April, when only a handful of food-plant species are available for the gibbons.<br/><br/>Group size has been reported to range from 4-8 individuals, with an average of 5.3-5.5 individuals, depending on the year of the study; during 2009-2011 the largest group comprised of 11 individuals (Mootnick <em>et al</em>. 2012). Like its closest congener the Cao Vit Gibbon (<em>Nomascus nasutus</em>), the Hainan Gibbon appears to be habitually polygynous with a bi-female breeding system (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016). Home range size was previously thought to be large for gibbons, with estimates between 2.0-9.87 km<sup>2</sup> (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989, Wei <em>et al</em>. 2004, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, recent standardised analysis has indicated that home range size is actually in line with closely related species, with an average home range of 1.49 km<sup>2</sup> (Bryant 2014, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016b, Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017). The third group has a smaller home range of less than 1 km<sup>2</sup> (Bryant 2014, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016, Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>","<p>  </p><p>Only 1-2 probable reports of gibbon hunting are documented from the last three decades at Bawangling National Nature Reserve (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017), due to local taboos and high penalties. However, although core remaining habitat at Bawangling has been relatively well protected, poaching of other wildlife with rifles and traps continues to occur within the reserve, so this species is still potentially at threat from hunting activity (e.g. accidental shooting through mistaken identity).<br/><br/>The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Chan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Fellowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016). There are reports of a sex bias in births, but it is not possible to identify the sex of young Hainan gibbons in the field, because immature individuals do not differ in fur colouration or calls, and sexual organs of males and females resemble each other (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2006). However, recent genetic analysis has indicated that three out of four offspring born into one group in recent years were male (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Forest loss also remains a threat: between 1991 and 2008, remote sensing vegetation maps reported a decrease in gibbon habitat across Hainan by 540 km<sup>2</sup> (35%), and by 6.3 km<sup>2</sup> (7%) in the locality of the last remaining population at Bawangling National Nature Reserve. Forest patches suitable to support gibbons decreased from 754 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 316 km<sup>2</sup> in total area during this period, with plantations replacing forests below 760 m, and habitat becoming increasingly degraded (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987, 1989; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p>  </p>","<p>  </p><p>In the late 1950s, the population was estimated to be over 2,000 individuals (Haimoff 1984, Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987).

In 1998, the Bawangling population was thought to consist of 17 individuals (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2004). During a comprehensive survey in 2003, only 13 individuals were recorded, consisting of two groups, in addition to two solitary males (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005). Fellowes <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported 17-20 individuals in two social groups and with up to five solitary individuals, based upon fieldwork in 2007. A new, third group comprising two breeding females was formed in 2011 (Bryant 2014), and in 2015 a fourth group with a single breeding female was established (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>At present there are more than 25 individuals, but the exact number cannot be ascertained due to the difficulty in tracking dispersed sub-adults, especially the non-vocal females, although recent research indicates that new acoustic monitoring techniques may help to clarify the total number of solitary gibbons (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016). All mated females in the three previously known groups have produced infants roughly every two years, and all infants grew to adulthood except the death of the third group’s first neonates (B. Chan, unpubl. data). Unfortunately, little is known of the natural mortality rates of any age class in the population (Bryant 2014, Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).

At present it is only known to occur within Bawangling National Nature Reserve on Hainan (Chan<em> et al.</em> 2005, Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000, Turvey <em>et al.</em> 2015) and is the most threatened primate species in the world (Geissmann 2005). Suitable gibbon habitat exists more widely across the Bawangling landscape and also outside Bawangling, and there have been anecdotal reports of gibbon occurrence in various forested sites, such as Yinggeling National Nature Reserve, Jiaxi Nature Reserve and Limushan Nature Reserve (B. Chan unpubl. data, Turvey<em> et al</em>. 2016). Surveys have been conducted in some of these areas, but have not as yet detected any concrete evidence of any additional surviving gibbon individuals or populations (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Within Bawangling, past conservation efforts have focused on regular monitoring of the gibbon population, restoration of degraded lowland forest, and engagement of local villagers in conservation activities (Fellowes <em>et al.</em> 2008). Community work including public outreach and promotion of alternative livelihoods to lessen the villager's reliance on forest products and lands have also been initiated, however, there is a need for continued gun and trap confiscation around Bawangling. Following the 2014 conservation action planning meeting for the Hainan Gibbon (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015), current key conservation activities include: continued monitoring and development of optimal monitoring techniques to better understand gibbon dispersal, group formation and colonisation of new habitat; continued effective protection of gibbon habitat and enhancement of forest connectivity within and beyond the reserve, to promote expansion of gibbons into additional good-quality habitat; development of an emergency response plan in the event of a crisis situation; and improved communication to facilitate collaboration among stakeholders. Protection and restoration of adjoining lowland habitat is also necessary to allow longer-term expansion of the gibbon population, and enrichment planting of late successional gibbon food plant species in the species-poor secondary forest adjacent to current gibbon habitat is likely to constitute an important conservation action.<br/><br/>Captive breeding does not appear to be an appropriate strategy for this species in the short-term, because the population appears to be breeding at a healthy rate in the wild, and there are no individuals currently in captivity, with the cost of removing individuals from the current population (and potentially losing any individuals during capture) predicted to have adverse effects on <em>in situ</em> population survival (Bryant 2014, Bryant<em> et al.</em> in prep).</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

This could trigger criterion CR E for this species, however due to current uncertainty over its future and stronger evidence for criteria A, C and D being triggered for this species, criterion E is not applied for this assessment.<br/><br/>Sumatran Rhinos have declined significantly across their range in the past 30 years, with populations lost in Peninsular Malaysia, the State of Sabah, Malaysia, and in Kerinci Seblat National Park in Indonesia. The three principal threats across Sumatra are small population effects (e.g., the Allee effect), human disturbance, and poaching. Threats in the three populations are slightly different (Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In Way Kambas National Park, threats are poaching, bird collection, illegal fishing, agar wood collection, human disturbance, annual and catastrophic drought, annual and catastrophic forest fires. In Bukit Barisan Selatan, primary threats are poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, human disturbance (e.g., natural resource collection activities such as non-timber forest products, illegal bird collection, pangolin poaching, and illegal fishing), road development, small and large scale encroachment, and catastrophic events. In Aceh Province, threats include poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, catastrophic events, El Nino Southern Oscillation events, human disturbance and encroachment, forest conversion into various commodities and plantations, and road development. In Gunung Leuser National Park, the primary threats are poaching, the potential for stochastic catastrophes, human encroachment and disturbance, forest conversion, and road construction.","The species inhabits tropical rainforest and montane moss forest, and occasionally occurs at forest margins and in secondary forest (Nowak 1999). Sumatran Rhinos occur mainly in hilly areas nearby water sources, and exhibits seasonal movements, moving uphill in times of lowland flooding (van Strien 1975). This shy species is dependent on salt licks, and occurs mostly in primary forest in protected areas, but wandering into secondary forests outside protected areas, especially in the dry season in search of water (van Strien 1975).<br/><br/>Males are primarily solitary, but can have overlapping territories with females, which are commonly found with offspring (Nowak 1999). The home range size of females is probably no more than 500 ha, while males wonder over larger areas, with likely limited dispersal distance. The species is generally solitary, except for mating pairs and mothers with young (Nowak 1999). Its life history characteristics are not well known, with longevity estimated at about 35–40 years, gestation length of approximately 15-16 months. Captive females have copulated as early as six years of age, and males at eight years of age (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2015; IRF website 2018, www.rhinos.org). Females may develop reproductive pathologies if they do not become pregnant (Roth pers. comm). Because they are induced ovulators (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2001) timing of females meeting males is critical; females are most likely to become pregnant when an ovarian follicle is approximately 20 mm in size prior to copulation.<br/><br/>Home ranges are up to 5,000 ha for males, 1,000–1,500 ha for females. Daily movements between feeding sites and wallows are probably only a few kilometres per day. Longer treks are made when males and females go to saltlicks (5-10 km) and by males exploring their large ranges. Dispersal appears to be mainly by sub-adult animals (4-7 years) old. In this period they may be found rather far from the home grounds. Adults are very traditional in the use of their ranges and will not move away unless severely disturbed. Water is never very far away in the habitats occupied by the Sumatran rhino.","The three principal threats across Sumatra are small population effects (e.g., the Allee effect), human disturbance, and poaching.&#160;The species is now so reduced that there are very small numbers in each locality where it still survives. Threats in the three populations are slightly different (Miller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In Way Kambas National Park, threats are poaching, disturbance from bird collection, illegal fishing, agar wood collection, human disturbance, annual and catastrophic drought, annual and catastrophic forest fires. In Bukit Barisan Selatan, primary threats are poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, human disturbance (e.g., natural resource collection activities such as non-timber forest products, illegal bird collection, pangolin poaching, and illegal fishing), road development, small and large scale encroachment, and catastrophic events. In Aceh Province, threats include poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, catastrophic events, El Nino Southern Oscillation events, human disturbance and encroachment, forest conversion into various commodities and plantations, and road development. In Gunung Leuser National Park, the primary threats are poaching, the potential for stochastic catastrophes, human encroachment and disturbance, forest conversion, and road construction.<br/><br/>Poaching looms as a threat but at this time is opportunistic and that organized criminal networks are not in operation at the scale they are in Africa. Poaching is primarily driven by the demand in Viet Nam and China for the supposedly medicinal properties of rhino horns and other body parts, and as a high-value gift item. Many centuries of over-hunting as well as habitat loss has reduced this species to a tiny percentage of its former population and range.","The total population now is estimated to be fewer than 80 individuals. Until the early 1990s the numbers continued to decline at a rapid rate with estimated losses of 50% or more of the population per decade (Foose and van Strien 1997). The total population of the Sumatran Rhino has declined by at least 80 percent in the last 30 years. The combination of the extent and rate of population reduction, as well as population fragmentation, makes it perhaps the most threatened large mammal on Earth.&#160;<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis</em> now occurs only on Sumatra, where there are fewer than 80 individuals in roughly ten subpopulations (Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). The largest populations remain in Bukit Barisan Selatan, Way Kambas, and Gunung Leuser National Park (Miller<em> et al.</em> 2015). The population estimate is still in question in Bukit Barisan Selatan, with no estimate larger than 10 individuals at most and no signs of calves in the past four years. There are thought to be 15-25 rhinos in Way Kambas, the only population considered to be slowly growing, with four calves observed in 2014. In Aceh, there are five subpopulations, ranging in estimated size from two to 24, for a possible maximum total of 30-40 individuals. Miller <em>et al. </em>(2015) report that there may be three small subpopulations in Leuser Barat, but this has not been confirmed. At least four of the five subpopulations in the north of Sumatra are considered non-viable, containing only between two and five animals (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2015). Despite protection, populations continue to decrease. Anti-poaching teams are in place in Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas National Parks, and in parts of Gunung Leuser.&#160;<br/><br/>A tiny population (perhaps no more than three animals) was discovered in east Kalimantan in 2012. Surveys are currently underway to determine the individuals and locations. In 2016, a female with a snare wound was successfully rescued, but subsequently died. In 2018, another capture operation for one animal began in April; a female was captured in November 2018. At the time of this assessment she is in relatively good condition.&#160;<br/><br/>The population status of the subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis</em> is unknown, with the very slight possibility that a small number of individuals survive in Myanmar.<br/><br/>There are nine animals in captivity, eight in Indonesia and one in Sabah, Malaysia. Two calves were born at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Way Kambas National Park in 2012 and 2016.

The species' precise historical range is indeterminate, as early accounts failed to distinguish rhinos to specific level, due to partial sympatry with the other two Asian rhino species (<em>Rhinoceros sondaicus</em> and <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em>).<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis</em> formerly occurred in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar (Nowak 1999). The subspecies is extinct in the three former countries, but there is a possibility that a tiny remnant population remains in northern Myanmar.<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni</em> formerly occurred throughout the island of Borneo.

A handful of individuals may still survive in east Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) (Kurniawan, pers. comm.).<br/><br/><em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis</em> formerly occurred in Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra (Indonesia). Presently, the subspecies&#160;primarily occurs in three protected areas in Sumatra (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2015); there may be a handful of stragglers living outside protected areas, particularly in Aceh Province.

The expansion and reinforcement of anti-poaching programs, as well as expanding the current captive breeding program, are the top priorities if this species is to survive.<br/><br/>A standardized method for rhino monitoring has been developed and launched (Tim Monitoring Badak Sumatra 2014). However, it has only been partially implemented and in few areas. The low number apparently poses a big challenge in obtaining an adequate sample that will result in reliable population estimates. Meanwhile, there has also been a concern about introducing disturbance if an intensive survey is conducted in sensitive areas. Because of this, to-date no robust population data are available. The current survey is directed to focus on identifying rhino that are considered ""doomed"" and to be rescued as recommended by the PVA analysis (Miller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) and endorsed under the Government of Indonesia's Emergency Action Plan.<br/><br/>There are ongoing efforts to further develop capacity for managed breeding in Indonesia. There have been recent advances in captive breeding techniques for this species, including successful births at the Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden in 2001, 2004, and 2006 and at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Sumatra in 2012 and 2016. All the animals from Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden (United States) have now been transferred to the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary. The size of the facility will be doubled by the end of 2019 so that it can hold more animals. The Government of Indonesia has endorsed further rhino rescues to speed up conservation breeding. In late 2018, a collaborative project led by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, involving the IUCN SSC, the International Rhino Foundation, WWF, National Geographic, and Global Wildlife Conservation and Yayasan Badak Indonesia, WWF-Indonesia, and Forum Konservasi Leuser in-country, was launched to speed up the conservation breeding of the species by expanding the Way Kambas Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary and to develop new captive breeding centres in Leuser and in Kalimantan.<br/><br/>The Government of Indonesia published its ""Strategy and Action Plan for the Conservation of Rhinos in Indonesia"" covering the time period of 2007 to 2017.

The Governments of Indonesia and Malaysia have, in principle, agreed to this exchange but for various reasons no exchanges have occurred.

Accordingly, a more accurate classification of Guanaco, such as a Regional Assessment is needed in order to reflect the actual heterogeneity of populations across its multi-country distribution.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation due to overgrazing, competition with introduced herbivores, and habitat degradation due to extractive industries are the main threats to Guanaco (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).

The loss of connectivity has resulted in small, closed and isolated populations under increasing risk of collapse due to the loss of genetic variation and environmental or demographic stochasticity – the latter being highly relevant to inordinately small populations.&#160; Recent research, however, on a small island population of Guanacos indicates that such isolation may not be the problem of genetic-diversity loss in the short-term (70 years) as previously envisioned, yet long-term consequences are inevitable (<span lang=""EN-US"">González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/>Live-shearing of captured Guanacos is currently under development in Patagonia with Argentine-government funding. &#160;If properly managed, these programmes can offer an alternative to local economies and re-evaluation of negative attitudes by landowners towards the species (Franklin <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, Lichtenstein and Carmanchahi 2012, Lichtenstein 2013). More than 11,000 Guanacos had been shorn between 2004-<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB"">2008, yet today only a very small percentage of the total Guanaco population is under such management (Lichtenstein 2013). The effects of sustained-fibre utilization are being assessed and monitored, especially where Guanacos are concentrated in scattered high-density populations (Ovejero <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Carmanchahi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). To encourage the marketing of Guanaco products, Argentina is developing and promoting Guanaco yarn and thread.<br/><br/>Guanacos have been legally hunted in Chile since 2003, with pressure for similar management in the Argentinean Patagonia in order to reduce density and conflicts with livestock production and forestry. However, a recent study revealed that hunting adult Guanacos by itself does not reduce browsing damage to <em>Nothofagus</em> regeneration in Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Martinez-Pastur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Still, government sanctioned and organized harvesting of Guanacos has resulted in the exportation of meat, contributed to the value of the species, and begun to reduce traditional conflict with sheep ranchers and foresters.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco is a wild ungulate found from sea level to over 5,000 meters elevation (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, González in prep.). At the continental and country levels, climate has mainly driven distributional range of the species (González<em> et al.</em>&#160;2013). Guanaco habitat is characterized by highly seasonal climates, dry winters or snow covered, cold temperatures including below zero, winds from moderate to high intensity and low precipitation combined with high evapotranspiration create arid conditions that in general result in low plant productivity (Franklin, 1982, 1983; Wheeler 1995).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In the sub-region of Patagonia (Hershkovitz 1972) Guanacos inhabit four of the ten major environments described for South America (González<em> et al.</em>&#160;2006): 1) Desert and Xeric Shrublands, 2) Montane Grasslands, 3) Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands, and 4) Temperate Forests (Dinerstein <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). Phytogeographically, Guanacos inhabit the provinces of the Monte and Patagonia, arid and semi-arid shrublands, and grasslands comprising around 1,000,000 km² (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). On a smaller scale, the presence or absence of this species can be explained by altitude, vegetation, topography, and the occurrence of livestock (Travaini <em>et al. </em>2007, Acebes <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Iranzo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, González <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/></span><br/>Both migratory and sedentary populations exist across the Guanaco range. Migration is mainly driven by winter forage supply and snow depth as observed for Andean and some Patagonian population before and after the reproductive season (Ortega and Franklin 1995). A minimal annual home range reported for the species is 2-9 km<sup>2 </sup>in sedentary animals (Marino and Baldi 2008), whereas in migratory populations they can reach up to 900 km<sup>2</sup> in the Andes (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008) and around 40 km<sup>2</sup> in Tierra del Fuego during winter (Moraga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>The Guanaco’s primary natural predator is the Puma (<em>Puma concolor</em>; Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999) and secondarily the Andean Fox (<em>Lycalopex culpaeus</em>; Novaro <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160; Its distribution overlaps marginally with other native ungulates such as Huemul (<em>Hippocamelus bisulcus</em>) in Patagonia, Taruka (<em>Hippocamelus anticensis</em>) in mountains of the central Andes, and the Vicuña (<em>Vicugna vicugna</em>) in some parts of the altiplano (Luccherini 1996, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Rundel and Palma 2000).<br/><br/>Adult Guanacos weigh 80-120 kg (Wheeler 1995, González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006) and their breeding system is based upon resource defence polygyny, i.e. an adult male defends a territory where birthing and mating occur and a group of females and their offspring (chulengos) feed freely from the intrusion of other males (Franklin 1982, 1983). The Family Group is the basic social unit that occupies a Feeding Territory defended by the resident adult male. Other units found during the reproductive season, include Solo Males that defends a territory without females, and non-territorial Male Groups composed of males of various ages (Franklin 2011). In migratory populations outside the reproductive season, large Mixed Groups can be observed composed of both sexes of all ages (Ortega and Franklin 1995).<br/><br/>Vigilance and foraging accounted for almost 90% of the diurnal time budget for male and female Guanacos in Family Groups, where animals benefited from living in groups as individual foraging time increased with group size, as well as, collective vigilance against predators (Marino and Baldi 2008). Territoriality apparently limits population density, reaching lower K (equilibrium density) when contrasted with models based on individual forage intake (Marino <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Empirical field data has also shown that Family Group size is positively correlated with forage production within Feeding Territories (Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;in press).&#160;<br/><br/>Guanacos are generalist herbivores of intermediate selectivity, i.e. their diets include large proportions of both grasses and shrubs (Raedeke and Simmoneti 1988; Fraser 1998; Puig <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, 2011, 2014; Baldi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Domestic sheep was the main ungulate introduced across the Guanaco’s range, reaching 22 million within 50 years after its introduction in the Argentine Patagonia in the late 1800s. Guanacos and sheep largely overlap in their forage preferences as much as 80% in some areas (Puig<em> et al.&#160;</em>2001). Although both species can include some 100 plant species in their diets, only 17 species make up 80% of the diets, and in Patagonia two grass species represent 40% for both Guanaco and sheep diets (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Other introduced ungulates found in Guanaco habitat are goats, cattle, donkeys, and horses, but few studies have assessed their diet overlap with the Guanaco. A preliminary study in the Bolivian Chaco showed that the Guanaco is a generalist feeder, responding to the seasonal availability of fruits, flowers and leaves, including a variety of cacti (Cuéllar, unpublished data). In that same region Guanacos mainly compete for forage and spatial resources with cattle and horses.<br/><br/>Competition with livestock, hunting, and habitat modification has often resulted in Guanacos occupying marginal, low quality lands in terms of vegetation cover and the availability of preferred plant species caused by sheep monopolizing the most productive areas (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Iranzo <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). A spatial segregation has been found in northern Chile between Guanacos and Donkeys <em>Equus asinus</em> (Malo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Guanacos are still numerous and widely distributed but continue their decline initiated in the 19th century in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and major parts of Chile. Over-hunting, range degradation from livestock overgrazing, and interspecific competition for forage have all played significant and long-time roles in the demise of Guanacos all across their distributional range (Raedeke 1979; Franklin 1982; Miller<em> et al. </em>1983; Cunazza <em>et al. </em>1995; Cuellar and Fuentes 2000; Puig <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, 2004). Currently, the main threats are still widespread, but mining and energy projects are also becoming a factor. Of special concern is the recent and rapid development of unconventional oil and gas exploration across large areas of the Guanaco’s distribution.<br/><br/>In Peru Guanacos are seriously affected by poaching and subsistence hunting. Habitat degradation due to extractive industries and livestock overgrazing has been identified as major threats for the few remaining subpopulations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).<br/><br/>In Bolivia the current major threat is habitat loss due to overgrazing by livestock. Although sport hunting was halted in 2001 (Cuéllar, unpublished data), poaching is still common.<br/><br/>In Chile and Argentina, recreational hunting and poaching are major threats. In northern Chile at the local level, feral dogs are reducing Guanaco populations within and outside protected areas, and hybridism with Llamas is common in areas with low Guanaco densities. Mining and oil extraction along with photovoltaic and wind parks have expanded with the demand for increased production, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation of populations in both countries.&#160; In addition, in northern Chile and the Argentine Patagonia infrastructure development has caused road kills and entrapment within barriers lining highways causing local isolation and limiting population movements <span lang=""EN-US"">(Rey<em> et al.</em><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;2012). Finally, in Chile and Argentina where numbers have recovered due to government sponsored management programs and Guanaco populations coexist with ranching and forestry practices, there has been a return to public resentment towards Guanacos as occurred in historical times. Demonstrated-sustained programs of Guanacos utilization that benefit the local economy and lower population numbers are needed if Guanaco are to be maintained.<br/></span></span><br/>Health studies conducted in mainland Patagonia have shown that Guanaco populations are relatively disease-free, but susceptible to common diseases from domestic sheep, cattle, and horses (Karesh <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Beldomenico<em> et al.</em> 2003, Uhart <em>et al.</em> unpub. data). Castillo (2006) came to a similar conclusion based upon studies of parasite load in free ranging Peruvian Guanacos. Recently, scabies has been reported to affect Guanacos in northern Chile causing mortality in low-density populations. It is also a common disease in Guanacos inhabiting Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Skewes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Today the Guanaco occupies only 26% of its original range (calculated by Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Specifically, range distribution has been reduced by 58% in Argentina, 75% in Chile, and over 90% in Perú, Bolivia, and Paraguay (<span lang=""EN-US"">Cunazza <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Moreover, distribution has become fragmented into smaller, relatively isolated populations. Although the species is not threatened with demographic extinction at a continental scale, it is predicted that the northern subspecies <em>L. guanicoe cacsilensis</em> will become extinct in Peru within 30 years if current-hunting mortality rates are not curtailed (<a href=""www.conopa.org"">www.conopa.org</a>). Guanacos are ecologically extinct in most of their remaining range (Novaro<em> et al.</em>&#160;2000), with some southern populations at serious risk of local or even regional extirpation (Cunazza <em>et al.&#160;</em>1995). Spatial fragmentation in general is a threat to Guanaco populations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Recent findings suggest that inbreeding or aberrant mutations may lead to reproductive failure and congenital malformations (Franklin and Grigione 2005, Zapata <em>et al. </em>2008, González <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/></span><br/>Increasing pressure from private landowners in Patagonian rangelands may result in a threat to the remaining high-density Guanaco populations if management is not properly planned and implemented. Live-shearing and subsequent release of wild Guanacos could contribute to their conservation only if the effects of this activity are properly assessed and management is applied accordingly. If not ecologically sustainable, the viability of the most important Guanaco populations will be at risk. Careful evaluation of current management practices involving live shearing is currently in progress, but a long-term assessment is necessary. For Guanaco populations under a hunting strategy of use, information about habitat preferences, flight distance, individual and population movement, group composition, and the effect on neighbouring populations are urgently needed for proper assessment of this kind of productive system.<br/><br/>Land desertification due to overgrazing coupled with more severe and frequent droughts caused by climate change/variation are potential threats of great concern to Guanaco abundance throughout its range. Severe droughts can have drastic effects on local Guanaco populations as documented in eastern Patagonia (Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In addition, models on climate change predict a sharp decrease in rain precipitation within the next 50 years in arid-southern South America (Nohara <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Therefore, it is crucial to favor the ecological functionality of Guanaco populations through adequate management as a step to mitigate additional effects of climate change.&#160;</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">It is estimated that Guanaco abundance has been reduced to only 3-7% of their original numbers when Europeans arrived to South America and the total Guanaco population was between 30-50 million animals (Raedeke 1979). Today, the total continental population of Guanacos is between 1,500,000-2,200,000 with the estimated number of adults between 1,000,000-1,500,000 (calculated from life-tables of Raedeke 1979; Fritz and Franklin 1994), two to three times greater than previously assessed (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">That number would be reduced if effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) is applied (Sarno <em>et al. </em>2015). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Some 81-86% of the Guanaco population is found in Argentina followed by Chile at 14-18%. The total numbers in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay are less than 1% of the total. Differences in survey methodologies and effort across such a vast area make it necessary to be cautious about population numbers and should be taken only as references. Specifically, what is needed is a more reliable estimate for the entire Argentine Patagonia (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Travaini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For Chile the total estimate is rather speculative as these numbers come from scattered information instead of planned surveys.&#160; More accurate surveys will hopefully come from new methods applicable for population estimation designed for large areas (González 2010a) or application of standard methodologies at broad scale (Soto 2010). For Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay, most assessments have been based mainly on animal counts because of the large and remote areas involved, possibly underestimating total population size.<br/></span></span><br/>Although Guanaco distribution in the Argentine Patagonia is rather continuous, densities are typically low (&lt;5 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>) and even very low in many parts of Chubut, Rio Negro and Neuquén Provinces (&lt;2 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>). High-density populations are actually scarce in the Patagonia of Argentina (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, 2010; Novaro<em> et al.</em>&#160;2007; Puig <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, 2003). A recent estimate for Patagonia was reported by Gavuzzo <em>et al.</em> (2015) applying aerial censuses techniques, but the numbers must be used for reference because of problematic assumptions, and used with caution if management decisions are at the local level (Schiavini and Rey 2015). Nevertheless, aerial surveys can agree with population estimation by modelling, for example those from the Santa Cruz Province (Travaini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For the rest of Argentina, population densities are below one Guanaco/km² and highly fragmented (Baigún <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Puig and Videla 2007) with some relict populations in La Pampa, Córdoba and Buenos Aires Provinces (Sosa and Sarasola 2005, Barri and Cufré 2014). Some high-density populations occur in southern Chile reaching up to 43 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at Torres del Paine National Park (Sarno and Franklin 1999), but in the rest of Chile populations are small and widely scattered.<br/><br/>As a general rule, it is recommended to use the distance sampling methods either for ground or aerial surveys for open and flat environments, as they are based upon more realistic assumptions than total counts or fixed-width strip transect methods that tend to underestimate population numbers (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, where numbers are very low as in relict populations, total counts or less systematic methods are appropriate as a first approach. Also, extrapolation of local densities to larger areas must be cautiously applied according to sampling effort and based upon proper statistical design. Some large-scale surveys are currently being conducted in Argentinean Patagonia, including modelling (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and aerial surveys using systematic, digital photographs taken along flight transects. In Chilean mountainous environments survey techniques are in the experimental phase using Monte-Carlo modelling and geostatistical-based estimates.</p><p>Guanaco population:</p><p></p><ul><li>Peru: 3,000</li><li>Bolivia: 150-200</li><li>Paraguay: 20-100</li><li>Chile: 270,000-299,000</li><li>Argentina: 1,225,000-1,890,000</li></ul>Total&#160;Guanaco population: 1,498,170-2,192,300<p></p><p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Trend:&#160; Increasing. Although the global population estimate is higher than previous assessments, current approaches take into account new information and methods of estimation (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Zubillaga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Travaini <em>et al.</em> 2015). <span lang=""EN-US"">Under-estimates and over-estimates have occurred in the past because of incomplete and inaccurate population-survey methodologies, especially in low population densities over the vast areas involved.&#160; <span lang=""EN-GB"">Also, some large areas previously unknown have been recently surveyed.&#160; At the same time, high-numbered populations in the Argentine and Chilean Patagonia have experienced significant growth in the past number of years <span lang=""EN-US"">(Zubillaga <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, caution should be noted that although numbers have seemingly increased in the far southern cone of South America, in the balance of the Guanaco’s distribution, populations are small and in real decline or at best tenuously stable, such as in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Chile, and Nnrthern Argentina (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).</span></span></p>",Increasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco is a widespread species with an extensive, although discontinuous, range from the northern Peru (8°30’ S) to Navarino Island (55°S) in southern Chile, from the Pacific Ocean in the northwest to the Atlantic Ocean in the southeast, and from the sea level to 5,000 meters elevation in the Andean Mountains (Franklin 1982, González<em> et al. </em>2006, González in prep.).<br/><br/>However, its distribution has been severely impacted by human beings. Constant hunting, human occupation and fragmentation of habitat, competition with livestock, and the installation of fences (<span lang=""EN-US"">Torres 1992, Franklin <em>et al. </em>1997, González <em>et al. </em>2006) have reduced the Guanaco’s distribution to only 26% of its original distribution (calculated by Ceballos <span lang=""EN-US"">and<span lang=""EN-US""> Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Clearly numerous local populations have become extirpated generating a distribution highly fragmented in many regions (Housse 1930, MacDonagh 1949, Mann <em>et al. </em>1953, Cunazza<em> et al. </em>1995, Torres 1992, González <em>et al. </em>2006, Baigún <em>et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>In Peru the northernmost population of Guanacos in South America occurs at 8°30'S (Franklin 1975, Linares <em>et al. </em>2010) in the Calipuy National Reserve in the La Libertad Department. To the south, populations reach the Salinas Aguada Blanca National Reserve in the departments of Arequipa and Moquegua (16°10'S), and a Guanaco population has been recorded in the Nevado Salcantay area in the Anta District (Wheeler 2006, Veliz and Hoces 2007).<br/><br/>In Bolivia, a relict population of Guanaco persists in the Chaco region (Cuéllar and Fuentes 2000) and recent sightings have been reported in the southern highlands between Potosi and Chuquisaca (Nuñez 2008). Although Pinaya (1990) reported the presence of Guanacos in southeastern Tarija, these records are in need of confirmation.<br/><br/>In Paraguay, a small relict population has been reported in the northwestern Chaco (Villalba 2004).<br/><br/>In Chile Guanacos occur from near Putre village at the northern border with Peru to Navarino Island in the far southern Fueguian zone (González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The largest Guanaco populations in Chile are concentrated in the Magallanes and Aysén regions in the far south.&#160; In the remainder of the country, small and fragmented Guanaco populations occur in the Andean foothills of the extreme north, scattered small pockets along the coast, the north-central zone in the lower Andes, and central Chile exclusively in the Andes (González 2010a, González<em> et al.&#160;</em>2013).<br/><br/>In Argentina most of the world’s remaining Guanacos are found. Although its range covers nearly all of the Argentine Patagonia, Guanaco populations appear to be more scattered towards the northern provinces of the country (Chubut, Río Negro, Neuquén, and Mendoza) compared to the southern region (Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego; Baigun <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Throughout northern Patagonia, distribution is highly fragmented in relict populations in the La Pampa and southwestern Buenos Aires Provinces. In central and northern Argentina, Guanaco distribution is restricted to the western half of the country along the pre-Andean and Andean mountains up to the border with Bolivia (Baigún <em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Recently a relict population has been reported in the arid Chaco of northwestern Córdoba (Schneider <em>et al</em>. unpublished data) and in Córdoba Guanacos have been reintroduced (Barri and Cufré 2014).</span></span></p>","<p>The call for the management and wise use of Guanaco products (fine undercoat/fiber and meat) put forth over the past several decades as an alternative approach to traditional conservation and strict protection (Franklin and Fritz 1991, Franklin <em>et al.</em> 1997) is now in the pioneering stages trying to establish itself as a wildlife production system (Hudson 1989). Research and application of meat harvest programs have been conducted on Tierra del Fuego, Chile, after monitoring population (Skewes<em> et al.</em>&#160;1999, Skewes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Soto 2010). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Nearly 23,000 animals have been harvested for meat between 2003 and 2015 in Chilean Tierra del Fuego with products primarily exported or used in the local market (N. Soto, pers. com. 2016). <span lang=""EN-US"">Fiber utilization was achieved initially from Guanaco farm individuals captured in the wild as newborns and raised in captivity during the 1980s and 1990s (Bas and González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000), but this approach has largely been discontinued because of high husbandry costs and world instability in the specialty-fiber market.&#160; Another approach, as mentioned above, holds more long-term promise from capturing, shearing and releasing of individuals in wild populations in programs being developed in Argentina. Finally, non-consumptive use, such as tourism, has also helped promote the aesthetic value of the species, especially in wild protected areas (Franklin <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997).<br/></span><br/>A major management program funded by the government is currently being developed in the Patagonia of Argentina for fine-fiber utilization of wild-live captured animals on protected areas. This type of management was at its height during the last decade between 2004-2008 when some 11,000 Guanacos were shorn (Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Lichtenstein 2013). Since then the number of animals has decreased due to international price variations for crude fiber. As a result, there has been a strong incentive to generate Guanaco fiber products as the local level, including yarn and thread (Lichtenstein pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services and Values<br/></strong>The importance of the Guanaco is based upon a multiple set of values (González 2010b). The most basic is its ecocentric or intrinsic value, that is, as a species its right to live, to exist, independent of the importance of the species to humans. This is an ethical base tangentially related to different groups and non-government organizations within the protective laws of each country.<br/><br/>There are a myriad of anthropocentric values that refer to the importance of a species to humans. The species provides multiple benefits to society, or ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) that are imparted to different segments of human society (Ojasti 2000). Guanacos provide regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services at different time and space scales. The benefits of the Guanaco to humans can be assessed by a number of values:</p><p></p><ul><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Existence Value&#160;</strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">that can be achieved through investment or payment to insure the existence of Guanaco populations without assumptions for its later use, is still in the beginning stages for this species.&#160; Nevertheless, the work of private organizations like Wildlife Foundation, Patagonia Conservation, and the Wildlife Conservation Society have indirectly assured the Guanaco’s future by acquiring large-land holdings for the conservation of ecosystems that include the species.</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Evolutionary Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>, </strong>through the Guanaco’s heritage of nearly 40 million years of evolution from its ancestors in North American (Franklin 1982, in press) and its anatomical and physiological adaptations (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006), its adaptiveness has enabled the species to become the dominate-wild mammal in Patagonia and parts of the Andean mountains of South America (Franklin 2011). This value is important when management is planned and its use is assessed, especially when contrasted with introduced-exotic animals.</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Ecological Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>, </strong>the Guanaco has a major role and broad component in the trophic and ecological network of the South American Andean, Patagonia, and aridland ecosystems. It has been observed that in the absence of this large herbivore, the Puma will consume other prey that are of importance to humans, namely domestic sheep (Novaro <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Laguna <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The Guanaco modifies plant growth in such a way that reduces dry matter prone to fire (Fuentes and Muñoz 1995) and disseminates seeds through the use of dung piles that promotes the recycling of nutrients and colonization of degraded soils (Cortés <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Henríquez 2004, Cavieres and Fajardo 2005). In addition, the padded feet of Guanacos do far less damage to soft soils compared to cloven hoofed livestock (König <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, König <em>et al</em>. 2015). They are also an important prey of predators and their remains are significant to scavenging animals, all of which contribute to ecosystem health and cycles.</span></li><li><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">Productive <span lang=""EN-GB"">Value</span></strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>,</strong> applies to a number managed Guanaco populations for the important production of fibre (hair) and meat (see section on Use and Trade). Guanaco fibre is extremely fine (14-16 microns) and potentially economically valuable, as currently being obtained from live capture and release programs in the Patagonia of Argentina. Also, the value of its meat is being harvested from populations in Tierra del Fuego, Chile.</li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Ethnic Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong> </strong>of the Guanaco is high as an invaluable species that has permitted the existence of humans in a variety of remote and dry environments of South America (Franklin 1982). All indigenous cultures associated with the deserts, Andean mountains, and the Patagonian and Fuegian zones utilized the Guanaco, and in some cases depended upon the species for food, clothing, shelter, and artistic and spiritual inspiration (Miller 1982). Its ethnic value was paramount, thanks to the process of domestication in the Central Andes, in the creation of the domestic Llama (Wheeler 1995).

Also, Pablo Neruda in his work “Canto General” (<em>General Song</em> in English) of 1950, dedicated words to the Guanaco in several of his poems. In addition, the Guanaco has been featured in major popular magazine articles and a number of television specials and documentaries by Nova, Nature, Discovery and National Geographic seen by multi-millions of people (see for details <a href=""http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/listado_guanaco_2014.pdf"">http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/listado_guanaco_2014.pdf</a>).</span></li></ul><p></p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco occurs in a number of protected areas and is included in Appendix II of CITES, thus regulating its international commerce of meat and fine-fiber products to insure that such trade does not threaten the Guanaco’s survival. &#160;In selected areas the sale of Guanaco products in local and international markets has contributed to its “species value” in recovered populations that can be used for reducing human-Guanaco conflict with ranchers and forestry production.&#160; Precaution needs to keep in mind for numerically depressed populations where consumptive and commerce use could irreversibly affect population stability; because of such potential problems, national legislation and international control via CITIES and other programs are relevant and important.<span lang=""EN-US""></span></p><p></p><ul><li>Peru. Recent legislation ratifies the alarming status of the Guanaco in Peru classifying it as Critically Endangered (Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego 2014). Governmental management of populations has been changed from CONACS (Consejo Nacional de Camélidos Sudamericanos = National Council for South American Camelids) to SERFOR (Servicio Forestal = Forestry Service) and local communities.</li><li>Bolivia. The government is working with local NGOs and authorities to strengthen the management of protected areas for the species. The government has issued an official notice to law enforcement offices in relevant regions concerning the protection of the Guanaco. The main conservation aim has been achieved thanks to the permanent presence of trained indigenous parabiologists and park rangers in the remaining range of the species (Cuéllar unpub. data). The situation is similar in Paraguay were the population is very small and the local NGOs and governmental institutions are working to maintain and protect the last remaining populations of Guanacos in the country.</li><li>Chile. The species is protected by the National Hunting Law (Ley de Caza) that regulates hunting, breeding, and in situ use. However, personnel for law enforcement are insufficient. Only 4% of the country’s Guanaco habitat has effective protection (8,354 km<sup>2</sup> in 8 National Parks and 4 Reserves). Additionally, there are fiscal and private areas where hunting is prohibited, either with relict populations (7,750 km<sup>2</sup>) or that directly protect the species (1,212 km<sup>2</sup>). A National Management Plan does not exist, but regionally a Conservation Plan has been developed for northern and central Chile (Grimberg 2010). Finally, Guanacos have been classified as Vulnerable in northern and central Chile and Least Concern in southernmost Chile by the Environmental Ministry (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente 2012), where the Guanaco is included in environmental assessment of investment projects such as mining, energy, infrastructure, and others.</li><li>Argentina. A National Management Plan (Plan Nacional de Manejo del Guanaco, Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006) was prepared in 2006 and endorsed by the provinces with the highest Guanaco densities. The plan was coordinated by the Federal Wildlife Agency (Dirección de Fauna Silvestre) involving local institutions with its main focus on the Patagonia. The Federal Wildlife Conservation Law (Ley Nacional de Conservación de la Fauna) and various provincial acts provide a legal basis for the protection and use of the species. In Patagonia, Guanaco conservation measures include sustainable use of the species in the wild, regulation of hunting, and closing of some access routes and oil trails. Nevertheless, law enforcement capacity is low since most provinces lack sufficient personnel and equipment to control vast areas. Protected areas in the Patagonian steppe would encompass 10% of the Guanaco population if effective, but most protected areas are rather nominal as they contain livestock, lack wildlife guards, and poaching is common. The percentage of the area under effective protection in the Patagonian steppe is estimated at a disconcerting level of less than 1% (Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). In the central provinces there are eleven protected areas (national, provincial and private). In general, progress has been made in legislation and management tools, but implementation is needed.</li></ul><p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The species also qualifies as Endangered B2ab(iii) based on IUCN's required 2x2 km grid, which measures the area of occupancy (AOO) as 24 km². If the actual area of the water bodies it occupies was used as the AOO (only 1-2 km²), it would qualify for Critically Endangered under criterion B2. <br/><br/>This species is located in only a few isolated drainage canals and springs in the Sperchios Valley, Greece. <em>Pungitius hellenicus</em> prefers calm, clean water with a lot of aquatic vegetation. The areas where the species is known from are under threat of pollution, drought and human usage which may cause a possible future decline or extinction of the species.

It is inferred that overall population decline has approached 30% over that period (although the population is now stable and or even increasing in some areas, e.g. France), so the species is assessed as Near Threatened (approaching A2c).","It forages in Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean shrubland and woodland, feeding on moths and other insects. In Italy, preferred foraging habitats are broadleaved woodland and riparian vegetation; coniferous woodland is avoided, and shrubland is rarely used (Russo <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Spain, foraging activities take place mostly in edge habitat such as hedgerows, woodland edges and isolated trees (Goiti <em>et al. </em>2008). Summer roosts are located in natural and artificial underground sites, as well as attics in some part of the range. In winter it hibernates in underground sites (usually large caves with a constant microclimate). It is a sedentary species (the longest recorded distance traveled by an individual is 134 km) (Heymer 1964 in Hutterer <em>et al.</em> 2005).","Threats include loss of foraging habitat, and disturbance and loss of underground habitats. On a landscape scale, fragmentation and loss of linear elements such as hedgerows and riparian vegetation is a problem because such elements are used as landscape references for commuting.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Foraging habitats are lost due to intensive agriculture, urbanization and large infrastructures.&#160;The species' strong dependence upon caves for roosting makes it particularly sensitive to cave disturbance, such as that from caving or tourism. Tourist disturbance of caves affects the species in a number of range states. The use of organochlorine pesticides is believed to have contributed to the earlier dramatic decline of the species in France (Brosset <em>et al.</em> 1988). In North Africa, threats include habitat loss due to agriculture (livestock) and human disturbance.","An infrequent species. Summer colonies number <em>ca</em>. 50-1,500 individuals (S.

Large population declines have been reported in a number of European countries, including Spain (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). In France, the population declined by <em>ca</em>. 70% between 1940 and 1980, although subsequently the trend appears to have stabilized (Brosset <em>et al.</em> 1988, S. Aulagnier pers. comm. 2007). Apart from <em>R. blasii</em>, which may have gone extinct in the country, <em>R. euryale</em> is probably the rarest rhinolophid in Italy, and anecdotal evidence suggests that a number of colonies have declined in the past few decades (D. Russo pers. comm. 2006). The species has a very small and declining population in Portugal (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2003, Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is also considered extinct from Gibraltar (S. Finlayson pers. comm. 2015). It is stable and common in the central and eastern Balkans (M.

The decline is suspected from the species' dependence on native forest (Mildenstein 2012) and the observed reduction in the extent of its lowland forest habitat. The species is also extremely sensitive to hunting in general, and especially to roost site disturbances. Only 3 of the 12-15 remaining populations known to contain this species are at roost sites that are essentially protected from most disturbance (Subic Bay, Boracay, Mambukal), and even these populations in the best case scenario are declining at a rate of 10-15% per generation (Mildenstein 2012). Finally, population sizes of this species are very small, most (9 of 12 known populations) containing fewer than 200 individuals, and many of those with fewer than 50 individuals. With the inferred population dynamic and genetic challenges associated with small populations, it is assumed these populations' decline are exacerbated by their small sizes.</p>","This is amongst the heaviest of the world's bats at up to 2.6 pounds (1.2 kg). Currently, it is always found roosting with <em>Pteropus vampyrus</em> (and sometimes <em>Pteropus hypomelanus</em>), but it is uncertain if it has always occurred in mixed roosts. It typically roosts in trees, and sometimes in mangroves on small islands (Hoogstraal 1951, Rabor 1986, Heaney <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998). There is generally high roost site fidelity (T. Mildenstein pers. comm. 2006), and roost sites are often located on steep slopes and cliff edges in areas that are difficult to access by humans. In mixed roosts of <em>A. jubatus</em> and <em>P. vampyrus</em> on Bohol, Boracay, Luzon, Mindanao, and Negros, <em>A. jubatus</em> was observed in the forest (away from the forest edge), whereas <em>P. vampyrus</em> were at the periphery, which might reflect a sensitivity of <em>A. jubatus</em> to disturbance (Mildenstein 2012, Gomez in litt. 2007).<br/><br/><em>A. jubatus</em> is known to be forest-dependent based on studies of diet and habitat use (Mildenstein <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Stier and Mildenstein 2005, Mildenstein 2012). Compared to co-roosting <em>P. vampyrus</em>, <em>A. jubatus</em>’ diet consists of a small subset of native forest tree species (N&lt;20 species, Stier and Mildenstein 2005) focusing especially on hemi-epiphytic fig species, which may be a staple food item (Stier and Mildenstein 2005). <em>A. jubatus </em>preferentially selects primary and high-quality second-growth forest for foraging (Stier and Mildenstein 2005, Mildenstein <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). The species may occasionally leave this type of habitat, using streams where fig trees grow on banks, they rarely forage in orchards on agricultural trees (Mildenstein <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). On Mindanao, farmers believe that <em>A. jubatus</em> is a pest in fruit orchards, but this remains unverified, and it is possible that these individuals are misidentified <em>P. vampyrus</em> which are known to use orchards regularly (T.L. Mildenstein in litt. 2007).","The species is threatened by severe habitat loss and hunting throughout its range, including within protected areas (Mildenstein 2012, L. Heaney pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/><strong><u>Habitat Loss</u></strong><br/><br/><em>Acerodon jubatus</em> is a known forest specialist based on studies of diet and habitat use (Mildenstein <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Stier and Mildenstein 2005, Mildenstein 2012). Vegetative GIS layers and Bat Count surveys show that population sizes (for both <em>A. jubatus</em> and <em>P. vampyrus</em>) correlate closely with available natural forest cover, suggesting bat populations are habitat -limited (Mildenstein 2011, 2012). However, <em>A. jubatus</em> populations are much more sensitive to habitat loss and degradation due to their exclusive use of natural forest compared to <em>Pteropus vampyrus</em>’ included use of agricultural crops and degraded forest areas (Mildenstein 2012).<br/><br/>Most (&gt;90%) of Philippines' original old-growth forest cover has been destroyed (Kummer 1992). If current trends continue, no old-growth lowland forest will remain by 2030. Remaining total forest cover in the Philippines is roughly 10-15% secondary forest cover, much of this extant forest occurs above 1,000 m asl, where <em>A. jubatus </em>is unlikely to occur (L. Heaney in litt. 2007). Although there has been a moratorium on logging in the Philippines for over two decades, forest removal is on-going. In Samar and Pangasinan (Luzon), open-cast mines are removing forest cover (M. Pedregosa pers. comm. 2006) and in southwestern Negros, a roost of this species occurs in a copper and gold mining claim area (E. Alcala pers. comm. 2006). The forest area in Subic Bay Watershed Reserve has reduced by housing, commercial and tourist developments (T. Mildenstein, pers. comm. 2012). The roost on Polillo which occurs on privately owned land is also under threat from human disturbance (P. Alviola pers. comm. 2006) and the roost site on Boracay was displaced due to infrastructure development for tourism (M. Lorica pers. comm. 2006). Based on these current rates of deforestation, the future population trend for this species will depend on: 1) the extent of regenerating secondary forest, and 2) the ability of <em>A. jubatus</em> to persist in secondary forest (L. Heaney pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/><u><strong>Hunting</strong></u><br/><br/>International trade data show that previously thousands of individuals of fruit bats were exported annually from the Philippines (Mickleburgh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992), many of these were likely to be <em>A. jubatus</em>. In 1995, the species were listed with other Pteropodids in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which brought about better enforcement of legislation, and increased efforts by customs in both Guam and the Philippines. The international trade of Philippine fruit bats is now minimal, although not altogether stopped (e.g. recent cases in Guam).<br/><br/>Hunting of flying foxes is illegal in the Philippines (except for the few remaining indigenous Aeta communities). However, fruit bat hunting is on-going and largely unregulated throughout the country. Reasons for hunting fruit bats in the Philippines vary. Fruit bats hunting is part of Filipino cultural heritage, and fruit bat meat is valued as a delicacy and/or for its medicinal properties (Cariño <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Mildenstein 2012). Fruit bats may also be relied upon as an opportunistic food source for forest workers (Gomez in litt. 2007, T. Mildenstein and S. Stier pers. comm. 2012). Finally, fruit bats are valued for sport hunting and as ‘pulutan’ (any snack eaten while consuming alcohol) (Cariño <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Mildenstein 2012). Depending on seasonal demands, local markets for fruit bats occur throughout the Philippines. Specific reports of local trade include on Negros Island, where individual bats can be sold for 15-30 pesos (0.30 -0.60US$) (Cariño <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006), in Davao, Calinan province, Mindanao (N. Ingle pers. comm. 2004), at the mixed species roost at the prison at Sablayan (Mindoro) (H. Garcia pers. comm. 2006). In general, hunters and fruit bat buyers think of <em>A. jubatus</em> as quite odourous compared to <em>P. vampyrus</em> (S. Stier, pers. comm. 2012). In Bataan province and around Subic Bay (Luzon), <em>A. jubatus</em> is less preferred to <em>Pteropus vampyrus</em> because of this quality, but the species look similar, and hunters are generally not aware of which species they are taking (S.C. Stier in litt. 2007).<br/><br/>Hunters use lines with hooks (D. Balete pers. comm. 2006, L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2011), shot guns, rifles, and air guns (T. Mildenstein, pers. comm. 2010, and A. Cariño in litt. 2007). The impact of hunting on fruit bat populations is greatest when it occurs at the roost site, which causes stress and risk of mortality across the entire colony. Species differ in their tolerance of roost site disturbance, with more specialized species expected to be more sensitive. <em>A. jubatus</em> populations exhibit a 12-fold reduction in population density when roost sites are unprotected compared to protected roosts with the same amount of surrounding habitat (Mildenstein 2012). Three roost sites (Boracay, Subic Bay, Luzon, and Mambukal, Negros) are formally protected from hunting by local landowners (Boracay) and the local government (Subic Bay and Mambukal), although occasional hunting is still known to occur at all three locations. At most other roost sites, <em>A. jubatus</em> experiences regular hunting pressure (Mildenstein 2012). Many flying fox colonies have moved from their original roosting sites due to hunting pressure (Mildenstein 2012), (e.g. Patag, Negros Occidental, Calinawan, Negros Oriental,Davao Oriental, Mindanao (A.B. Cariño pers. comm. 2007, Gomez in litt. 2007)).<br/><br/>Whether or not the roost site is protected from hunting, a large amount of hunting occurs away from the roosts during night-time foraging in protected and unprotected forests as well as farms kilometres from the roost. Nighttime hunting of bats away from the roost is known to be on-going in Subic Bay (S. Stier and T. Mildenstein pers. comm. 2001, M. Pedregosa-Hospadarsky pers. comm. 2010), Bohol (R. Pamaong-Jose pers. comm. 2011), Bilaran, Leyte (L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2011), Mt. Malindang (Nuñeza <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006), and Cebu (S. Ramayla pers. comm. 2011), and is likely to occur around all other roost sites containing this species (Mildenstein 2012).<br/><br/><u><strong>Roost site disturbance</strong></u><br/><br/>This species has been shown to be especially sensitive to disturbance at the roost site (Van der Aa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Mildenstein 2012). Even the three most-protected roosts, located on Boracay (off Panay Island), Subic (Luzon), Mambukal (Negros Occidental) are not especially protected from disturbance. All three lie within popular tourist areas, where they are subjected to disturbances caused by tourists and guides (e.g. clapping hands or deliberately tapping the roost trees to make them fly). In addition to causing more stress during a period when the bats are normally sleeping, there have been a number of reports of pups that got separated and abandoned due to disturbances at the roost site (Mildenstein 2012). Recent population estimates at these “protected” roosts show smaller populations compared to the 2000-2002 roost counts (Mildenstein 2012).","A rough estimate of the total population of <em>A. jubatus</em> is around 10,000 individuals (and probably no more than 20,000) (Mildenstein 2011, 2012). During the late 1800s and early 1900s there were many anecdotal reports of colonies of 100,000 bats, presumably mixed species. Hence, the total population of<em> A. jubatus</em> is estimated to be around one or two percent of what it was 200 years ago (L. Heaney pers. comm. 2006). Although there are still a few mixed species colonies that number between 10,000 and 30,000 individuals, generally, recent observations of mixed colonies have reported sizes of 5,000 and fewer individuals (Mildenstein 2011, 2012), and concur with surveys from the last three decades (Heaney and Heideman 1987, Heaney and Utzurrum 1991, Mudar and Allen 1986, Rickart <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1993, Utzurrum 1992).<br/><br/>Prior to fruit bat population surveys of the early 2000’s, most colonies of large fruit bats were assumed to include <em>Acerodon jubatus</em>, although the actual presence of the species in many colonies was not confirmed. Recent work by the Bat Count Project has shown that the number of remaining<em> A. jubatus</em> populations is fewer and population sizes are smaller than were thought to exist historically. Many fruit bat colonies do not have any <em>A. jubatus</em> at all, and when it is present, it has always been found in mixed species roosts with <em>Pteropus vampyrus</em> (and sometimes also with <em>Pteropus hypomelanus</em>). Of the 23 roosts sampled by Bat Count, only nine of these were found to contain <em>A. jubatus</em> during several survey days for each roost. For other roosts surveyed by Bat Count Philippines, the presence of the species was not documented, but repeat visits are necessary to confirm absence. It is not known whether colonies lacking<em> A. jubatus</em> represent extirpated locations or if the species was not found in these sites historically.<br/><br/>For most colonies known to be of mixed species, it is often unknown how abundant each species is in the colony (i.e. the species composition) (Mildenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Mildenstein 2011, 2012). In the mixed colonies that have been surveyed, <em>A. jubatus</em> make up a small proportion of the total colony size, ranging from <em>A. jubatus</em> making up around 5% of the mixed species population to as much as 20% of the individuals in the two most protected colonies (Mildenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Mildenstein 2011, 2012). In sites that are heavily disturbed, <em>A. jubatus</em> are often &lt;2% of roosting population (Mildenstein 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Along with being small and much less numerous, <em>A. jubatus</em> populations are also more isolated than<em> Pteropus vampyrus</em> populations. Molecular study of fecal samples from Subic Bay and Mambukal suggest there is moderate amount of population structure among <em>A. jubatus</em> populations (Mildenstein 2012), which would be expected given the species greater amount of forest specialization.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Philippines, where it is widespread with the exception of the Palawan faunal region and among the Batanes and Babuyan island groups (Heaney <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998). It generally occurs at an altitude range of 0-1,100 m asl. It is only found in large roosts with <em>Pteropus vampyrus</em>. Although <em>P. vampyrus </em>roosts have been, and are often still assumed to have <em>A. jubatus</em> present, the presence of <em>A. jubatus</em> at many roosts has not been confirmed. There are historic records for the species on the following islands: Basilan, Biliran (forgaging from a roost on Maripipi - Rickart <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (1993)), Bohol, Bongao, Boracay, Cabo (in Igat Bay, in Zamboanga del Sur Province, off Mindanao), Cebu, Dinagat, Jolo, Leyte, Luzon, Marinduque, Maripipi, Mindanao, Mindoro, Negros, Panay (formerly regarded as <em>Acerdon lucifer</em>), Polillo, Sibutu and Siquijor.<br/><br/>Recent surveys by the Bat Count Project (source Bat Count reports: Mildenstein <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, and Mildenstein 2011, unless alternative source given) on the presence and absence of <em>A. jubatus</em> at various bat colonies on islands in the Philippines report its presence at the following sites: 1) Bohol Island: Raja Sikatuna Protected Landscape, Bilar, 2) Boracay Island: A roosting colony was known that feeds on nearby Panay, but has recently been reported missing (M. Saulog pers. comm. 2011), 3) Cebu: A roost at between barangay Malones and Lanao, Dalaguete: and second roost was located in Boljoon town in southern Cebu in 2008 (L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2011), 4) Leyte: Bilaran Island (L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2011) and a colony at Mount Pangasugan, but <em>Acerodon jubatus</em> presence is unconfirmed, 5) Luzon: There are confirmed roosts documented from Subic Forest Watershed Reserve, Subic Bay, Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park, Divilacan, Cagayan, and in Ilocos Norte province, Pangasinan province, Baler in Aurora province, and Calamba in Laguna province (P. Alviola pers. obs. 2005), and possible roosts on Mount Banahaw (D. Balete pers. obs. 2003) and Kamunayan-Tabugan, Baggao, Cagayan (M.R.

Diwata, Agusan del Sur (Nuñeza <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). In Siocon and the Philippine Coconut Authority Area in Zamboanga del Norte, there is a roost of about 5,000 individuals of <em>Pteropus vampyrus</em> and <em>Acerodon jubatus</em> (according to trained students and the DENR), and Desmond Allen photographed a roost of <em>Acerodon jubatus</em> and<em> Pteropus vampyrus</em> in Bongao, Tawi-tawi (between 2003-2007). Possible roost sites, where the presence of the species requires confirmation, are in: Magum and Mati, Davao Oriental, Malita, Davao del Sur, and Mount Hilong-hilong, in the lowland dipterocarp forest of Cantilan and Carrascal, Surigao del Sur (Gomez in litt. 2007), 7) Mindoro: a roost occurs at Bilog na Sapa, Sablayan, Mindoro Occidental and possibly on the eastern side of the island (Saulog and Garcia pers. comm. 2005), 8) Negros: Calinawan, Enrique Villanueva and Sibulan, in Negros Oriental, Mambukal, Barangay Minoyan, Murcia, Mount Patag, and possible roosts in a mangrove area in the towns of Sagay, Hinoba-An, and Isabella near Mt. Kanlaon (L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2011) and in the Manlukahoc area (E. Alcala pers. comm. 2006), Negros Occidental, and 9) Polillo: a roost occurs on privately owned land (Alviola pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>The Bat Count Project has surveyed the following colonies of <em>Pteropus vampyrus</em> and did not find any <em>A. jubatus</em> (though it is unclear whether the species occurred in any of these roosts historically (Mildenstein 2011)): 1) Cebu: Tabunan, 2) Mindanao: Bongo Island, Maguindanao Province, and Pinol and Maitum, Sarangani Province, 3) Negros Oriental (southeast Negros): Sagay, Vallehermosa and San Jose, and 4) Panay: Batbatan Island and Culasi, Antique Province. The Siquijor populations are possibly extinct (Lepiten 1995), this species has been reported absent from there recently (A.B. Cariño pers. comm. 2006).","International trade data show that previously thousands of individuals of fruit bats were exported annually from the Philippines (Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em> 1992), many of these were likely to be <em>A. jubatus</em>. Hunting of flying foxes is illegal in the Philippines (except for the few remaining indigenous Aeta communities). However, fruit bat hunting is on-going and largely unregulated throughout the country. Specific reports of local trade include on Negros Island, where individual bats can be sold for 15-30 pesos (0.30 -0.60US$) (Cariño <em>et al.</em> 2006), in Davao, Calinan province, Mindanao (N. Ingle pers. comm. 2004), at the mixed species roost at the prison at Sablayan (Mindoro) (H. Garcia pers. comm. 2006).",Terrestrial,"<u><strong>Current conservation efforts</strong></u><br/><br/>The species is protected under the Philippine Wildlife Act (Republic Act No. 9147, 2001). <em>A. jubatus</em> has been included in Appendix I of CITES since 1995 (the species had previously been included in Appendix II since 1990). Although the species itself is formally protected, there is little enforcement of the protective legislation (N. Ingle pers. comm. 2011).<br/><br/>In addition, the majority of the species' roosts are within formally designated protected areas, but most receive very little protection (S. Stier and T. Mildenstein pers. comm. 2001, M. Pedregosa-Hospadarsky pers. comm. 2010, R. Pamaong-Jose pers. comm. 2011, L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2011, Nuñeza <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, S. Ramayla pers. comm. 2011, E. Breganza pers. comm. 2010, Mildenstein 2012).<br/><br/><u><strong>Conservation needs/priorities</strong></u><br/><br/>Clearly, one of the top priorities needs to be additional research on which we can base our conservation management decisions. We need to know more about where populations are extant, and we need to know much more about their current status. Long-term studies that track populations are very badly needed (L. Heaney pers. comm. 2011).<br/>More focused conservation efforts are also urgently needed for this species throughout its range. Especially needed are the establishment and management of protected roosting areas, which are expected to result in a rapid increase in the number of bats at the roost sites (Mildenstein 2012). Protected flying fox roosts have the added benefit of being popular eco-tourist attractions, providing local communities with a source of pride, income, and a venue for learning about the natural heritage of the Philippines. <br/><br/>It is imperative that hunting prohibition for this species is enforced until research has been done to identify hunting impacts on population sizes and sustainable harvest levels. Conservation capacity-building, education and awareness within local communities and among local government units and non-profits are also essential to imparting the risks that this species faces and encouraging conservation management. <br/><br/>Although some captive breeding facilities exist, it is unclear if these are sufficient for re-enforcing wild populations.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

They can be found at elevations up to 2,400 m, but are usually found around 300 m. They roost in hot and humid caves (Tejedor 2011). Little is known about mating systems in this family (Reid 2009). In El Salvador and Mexico, <em>N. stramineus</em> is reported to breed during the dry season. In Mexico and Central America, pregnant females have been found from January through July, and gestation is thought to last 8 to 10 months. Females are thought to be monoestrus, and to have slow development of the fetus (Tejedor 2011). A single offspring is produced annually, weighing almost half of the adult mass, or about 2.1 g. During the breeding season, the sexes apparently segregate, so that males and females roost separately. (Reid 2009, Tejedor 2011). Although it is surely insectivorous, nothing is known of the diet of <em>N. mexicanus</em>. Groups of Mexican funnel-eared bats leave the roost approximately 30 minutes after sunset; bats began returning to the cave 2 hours after emergence and continued entering and leaving the cave for the remainder of the night&#160;(Tejedor 2011).&#160;Its flight of is slow and very maneuverable.","As many other cave bats, this species might be affected by activities like mining and tourism.","This species generally roosts in deep (more than 1 km length), warm and moist caves but can be found at small ones too (less than 10 m length). These bats are typically found in groups of up to 300 bats in one colony. While roosting in the caves, the individuals are spaced out widely in the dark caverns (Tejedor 2011). Most flight occurs at understory level, with great speed and agility in dipping, twisting, and dodging the vegetation. These bats are most active within 2 hours after sunset. As the evening progresses, the bats may use nighttime roosts which differ from their normal daily roosting location.

It qualifies as VU under criteria A4c and C2a(i).</p>","The Giant Noctule (<em>Nyctalus lasiopterus</em>) forages over mixed and deciduous forest and wooded river valleys (the latter especially on migration). It is highly dependent on mature forest: the species needs a number (27-39) of old trees (Popa-Lisseanu <em>et al</em>. 2008) to support a colony, hence any tree removal is a threat. It is largely insectivorous, feeding mostly on Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, but is also reported to take many small passerines in the southern part of the range during migration. During the bird migration seasons, passerines are likely to form a major part of the diet. Faeces collected during these times are composed 90% of feathers (Smirnov and Vekhnik 2013) During these times, 70% of faeces collected contain feathers (Ibáñez <em>et al</em>. 2001). &#160;Tracking the species using radar in Spain it is now known that this bat flies up to several hundred metres presumably to catch migratory birds. <br/><br/>In summer it roosts in hollow trees and bat-boxes, and occasionally in buildings. Trees and rock crevices may also be used as hibernacula in winter. It sometimes uses similar habitats to the other species such as <em>N. noctula</em>. Nursery colonies are usually relatively small (up to 35 females). Females give birth to a single pup per litter. It is considered to be migratory in the north-east of its range, but there is very little data, although a high density of only males has been found in northern Croatia (M. Mazija pers. Comm. 2016). Vagrants have been recorded well outside the normal range (Hutterer <em>et al</em>. 2005).

Exceptionally, all pups were found dead in 2005 at one of the two largest colonies in Spain (located in a city park). The cause of these deaths was not known (Juste pers. comm. 2006).

However, virtually all of the  known large colonies have now been extirpated, including the loss of a  very large colony from Leyte in 1984 (L. Heaney pers. comm. 2006).

The  only other member of the genus is the smaller bat <em>N. neocaledonica</em> from  New Caledonia. Unlike all other bats in the Pteropodidae family, bats in  the Notopteris genus have long tails extending past the wing membrane  (i.e. free-tailed).<br/><br/>In Fiji <em>N. macdonaldi </em>is recorded from the three  largest islands, Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Taveuni, but its cave sites  are seemingly restricted to Viti Levu (Flannery 1995, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2007, Scanlon 2009, Scanlon <em>et al.</em>  2014a). Considered abundant in 1978 (Pernetta and Watling 1978), they  occupy a broad range of habitats in Fiji, including lowland forest,  intermediate altitude vegetation, and mossy montane forest, as well as  patchy secondary forest and rural gardens (Pernetta and Watling 1978,  Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em>1992, Flannery 1995, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Scanlon <em>et al.</em>  2014a).

Being small (adult mass: 50–90 g) and manoeuvrable, they  readily navigate through cluttered understory forest to access floral  resources. Little information is available on their habitat or ecology  on Vanuatu.","It is not known to be exploited in Vanuatu, and the threats there are  poorly known. However, this species is vulnerable to direct exploitation  and potential disturbance at roosting sites by vandalism, guano mining,  recreation, and quarrying (Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em> 1992). Large numbers of bats are taken from at least one cave in Fiji with shotguns for consumption (Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005). Tourism is a potential threat to nursery colonies in at least two of the four known maternity caves of Fiji (Palmeirim <em>et al.</em>  2005). A quarry has now been established in the immediate vicinity of  one cave (Wailotua) and blasting of rocks there likely threatens the  adjacent cave and bats (Scanlon 2009). Two of the four caves also occur  in highly urbanised areas near the capital city of Suva, increasing  levels of pollution, invasive species and disturbance there threatens  the bats and their cave habitats.","This bat is projected to be declining across its range. Fiji likely  holds more than half of the global total and is present on the three  main Fijian islands (Flannery 1995, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2007, Scanlon <em>et al.</em>  2014a). However, the only known breeding caves (four in total) are all  on Viti Levu, which has a favourable geology with some limestone caves.  Individuals on Vanua Levu and Taveuni may migrate to the nurseries on  Viti Levu, which is within their range of movement. Bats netted shortly  after dusk on Vanua Levu indicate that cave roosts may also occur there  (Scanlon <em>et al.</em> 2014a).

These threats are expected to continue.","This bat is usually found roosting in rock fissures and caves (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003) although it may also roost in tree foliage. In the Ankarana  National Park it often roosted in high points near the large entrances  of long caves with a high buffering capacity for temperature and  relative humidity (Cardiff 2006). The species' patchy distribution,  which includes humid, dry deciduous and spiny forest, is probably  related to the availability of suitable roost sites and <em>E. dupreanum</em> is  rare or absent from a number of forests without rocky outcrops (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Schmid and Alonso 2005, Jenkins <em>et al.</em>  2007). Although it continues to survive in highly modified landscapes with very  little native vegetation remaining (Ratrimomanarivo 2007), it appears  to use native forest vegetation for food in preference to introduced  plants (Picot <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Fruit is the main dietary component but it also eats leaves and other plant parts (Picot 2005, Picot <em>et al.</em>  2007). Through the ingestion of nectar and small seeds, a significant  role in pollination and seed dispersal is inferred (Picot <em>et al.</em>  2007, Ratrimomanarivo 2007). Plants are often found growing out of the  faeces beneath rock crevices occupied by <em>E. dupreanum</em> (P.A. Racey,  unpublished), which is also an important pollinator of threatened baobab  trees (Baum 1995, Andriafidison <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  (2003) suggested that <em>E. dupreanum </em>might be migratory (like its  congener in Africa, Richter and Cumming, 2008) because of regular  variation in the occupancy and abundance of roosts. Antibodies to Nipah,  Hendra, and Lagos Bat viruses, and isolates of other viruses were  detected in<em> E. dupreanum </em>at several sites in Madasgascar (Iehlé <em>et al.</em> 2007, Razafindratsimandresy <em>et al.</em> 2009, Reynes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Additional research is needed on natural history and in particular roosting ecology and movements.","This species is hunted for bushmeat across its range both at roosting  and foraging sites (Jenkins and Racey 2008, Randrianandrianina <em>et al.</em>  2010). Four out of nine <em>Eidolon dupreanum</em> roost sites in and around the Parc  National d'Ankarana showed evidence of hunting (Cardiff <em>et al.</em>  2009). It is classed as a game species under Malagasy law and although  it can only be legally hunted between May and August (Durbin 2007), this  legislation is widely ignored and the bats are hunted throughout the  year. Its roosts tend to be well protected from bushfires and it is able  to survive in landscapes with severely depleted natural food supplies  as long as alternative plants are available (Ratrimomanarivo 2007).  Since forest loss affects food availability (Picot <em>et al.</em> 2007) and may affect accessibility of roosts for hunting (Cardiff <em>et al.</em> 2009), deforestation and hunting are the main threats. Hunting accounted for a 30% desertion rate from 60 roosts (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003). Although hunters report that deserted roosts are recolonized  after a few years, there are several confirmed examples where this  species has been extirpated at roost sites (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2003).","The species' global population is suspected to have declined by 30% over the last three generations (generation length = 6 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) due to intense hunting, and the disturbance and loss of important roost sites. Estimates of colony size are difficult to obtain because the bats  are often difficult to observe in their day roosts, but is usually in  the range of 10–500 bats, with a median of 200 individuals (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003). The maximum roost count of 1,400 is from Parc National  d’Ankarana, in and around which the bats roosted in groups averaging 370  individuals in at least nine different roosts (Cardiff <em>et al.</em> 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the island of Madagascar where it is widespread, albeit with a patchy distribution (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003). It is found in coastal areas and on the central high plateau,  although absence of records probably reflects inadequate survey coverage  rather than a genuine absence.

The species is only known from three (3) disjunct sites (2 locations) on Negros and Cebu Islands; its AOO is 40-56 km². Its range is severely fragmented and the presumed extant subpopulations are estimated at 40-50 mature each, and likely much fewer. Historic hunting, and the past and ongoing forest loss, degradation, and fragmentation caused a past population decline by more than 80% resulting in the species previously being considered extinct as it had not been seen since 1964 (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 2008). In 2001 and 2003, a total of eight (8) individuals (seven mature individuals) were rediscovered on Cebu (2001; two mature individuals and one subadult) and Negros Islands (2003; five mature individuals).

Currently, extant subpopulations of fewer than 50 mature individuals are thought to persist in remnant patches of secondary forest on karst limestone on both Negros (Alcala et al. 2004) and Cebu (Paguntalan <em>et al</em>. 2004) where the natural vegetation on steep slopes can include batino (<em>Alstonia macrophylla</em>), hindunganon (<em>Macaranga</em> sp.), tubug (<em>Ficus septica</em>) and matamban (<em>Mallotus</em> sp.) (Paguntalan <em>et al</em>. 2004). The surrounding agricultural clearings are typically planted with abacca (<em>Musa textiles</em>), gabi (<em>Colocasia esculenta</em>) and coconuts (<em>Cocos nucifera</em>) (Paguntalan <em>et al.</em> 2004). The forest patch remnants at Carmen and Catmon (Cebu Island) and Calatong (southern Negros Island), are likely critically important sites for the species. Unfortunately, the available forest habitat for the species quite limited (Alcala <em>et al.</em> 2004), especially on Cebu where the series of small secondary-growth forest fragments on limestone are highly disturbed (Paguntalan <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/> <br/> Records suggest that the species is likely a cave obligate dweller (Rabor 1986, Heaney and Heideman 1987, Utzurrum 1992) and likely roosts in caves (or large cracks) in limestone and forages in karst-forest habitats (Heaney<em> et al. </em>1998, Paguntalan<em> et al. </em>2004), which have less rainfall than in other parts of the country. However, three individuals were collected roosting in coconut fronds (Rabor 1954), suggesting that <em>D. chapmani</em> may be more flexible in some of its foraging and roosting habits and may be able to use of degraded and highly disturbed habitats (Paguntalan <em>et al</em>. 2004).

Further, the illegal hunting of the species continues throughout its range.<br/> <br/> On Negros, lowland forest and karst habitat within the species’ historic range has been both significantly lost and heavily degraded by logging and clearing for agriculture. Less than 4% of the original forests remain on Negros Island, with only small patches of degraded forest in southern Negros where <em>D. chapmani </em>has been found (Evans <em>et al.</em> 1993). Since its rediscovery in 2001, significant forest conversion to agriculture and the loss of additional forests on Cebu due to mining for copper and gold. Further, the largest remaining forest fragment within the range of the species on Cebu is only &#160;60 ha and it is threatened by the cutting of trees for charcoal and agricultural development (Paguntalan <em>et al.</em> 2004); its current status is unknown.

Within this specialised habitat, this  species has a patchy distribution and was absent from ecologically  diverse riparian forests with abundant surface water (Law and Anderson 1999).<br/><br/>This small bat displays morphological adaptations for  foraging over water by having long, pointed wings with slightly high  aspect ratio and low wing loading (Norberg and Rayner 1987, Jones and  Rayner 1991, Campbell 2011), as well as large feet to rake the surface  of the water for aquatic prey (Campbell 2011, Law <em>et al.</em> 2020).  Dietary analysis identified a diet dominated by aquatic insects and to a  lesser extent, fish (Jones and Rayner 1991, Law and Urquhart 2000).  The distribution of the species has been affected by heavy metal  contamination and sediment pollution (Clarke-Wood <em>et al.</em> 2016, Gonsalves and Law 2017). <br/><br/><em>Myotis  macropus </em>roosts in tree hollows in riparian vegetation located within  100 m of permanent water (Campbell 2009).

This species is found in urban  environments where it has been recorded roosting in jetties (Gonsalves  and Law 2017) and road culverts (Gorecki <em>et al.</em> 2020). A study on  culvert roost availability found these roost types were limited, and  this may restrict the species’ distribution and abundance in urban  environments, whilst increasing their vulnerability to roost disturbance  (Gorecki <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/>Females form maternity colonies from October  to March, giving birth to a single pup two to three times per breeding  season (Dwyer 1970, Lloyd <em>et al.</em> 1999, Gorecki <em>et al.</em> 2020).

Population  structure has been identified between populations 12–15 km apart  (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2009, Law <em>et al.</em> 2020), and female genetic relatedness  was not detected beyond 30 km, indicating restricted gene flow between  even geographically close populations (VGorecki, unpublished data).","This species is spatially restricted due to its association with aquatic habitats, which are highly susceptible to changes in water quality caused by sedimentation, chemical pollutants, and altered flow regimes (Clarke-Wood <em>et al.</em> 2016, Gonsalves and Law 2017). Changes in water quality may further restrict this species’ distribution through the reduction in suitable foraging grounds. Roosting colonies are threatened by disturbance to roost sites, particularly in culverts and bridges during maternity season. Disturbance to maternity colonies has the potential to impact survival and breeding success. The loss of artificial roost sites has the potential to restrict the species’ distribution and abundance in urban environments due to the limited availability of suitable artificial roosts (Gorecki <em>et al.</em> 2020).

The colony usually consists of  30-80 individuals. In buildings, however, they can also be more numerous  (up to 200 females). As many other woodland bats, it is prone to  frequent change of roosts (1-2 times a week). Male colonies of up to 30  animals also occupy tree cavities, bat and bird boxes and buildings. It  hibernates in underground habitats (caves, cellars and mines), usually  solitary or in small clusters of 2-5 individuals (Simon <em>et al.</em>  2012). The best known hibernation site is Nietoperek fortification  system in Poland with more than 300 recorded hibernating bats (EUROBATS  2019).<br/>It hunts over a variety of habitats such as meadows, pastures,  orchards, broadleaved woods, open coniferous forests and riparian  areas. Intense foraging was observed inside cattle sheds. Feeding areas  range between 128 and 580 ha. The core of a feeding area can be up to 4  km away from the roost and individuals are faithful to them, returning  there regularly. Commuting routes between the roost and the core area  are also utilised for foraging. In a German study, the average distance  between maternity roosts and feeding areas was 1.5 km.M. nattereri can  capture prey on the wing and by gleaning resting insects from the  surface of vegetation using the tail membrane and/or feet. The chief  components of its diet are Diptera and Coleoptera, especially Brachycera  and Curculionidae. Diurnally active insects, insects which rarely fly  and non-flying arthropods are also eaten (see the literature review in  Kyheröinen <em>et al.</em> 2019). Faecal pellets collected at a  hibernation site in southern England for two winters, indicated that <em>M.  nattereri</em> forages throughout winter on non-volant Aranea, Isopoda and  Lepidoptera (Hope <em>et al.</em> 2014). Movements between summer, autumn  and winter roosts up to 185 km were recorded (Schober, Grimmberger  1998).

Enlargement of crops leading to the destruction of  small-scale, insect-rich cultivated landscapes. Insect loss due to the  intensive agriculture, forestry and use of pesticides, also in livestock  farming. Reduction of summer and winter roosts' availability due to  forest operations (removal of deadwood and old trees with cavities),  renovation of buildings, bridges, cattle stables etc. Disappearance of  small waters in the forest and in the country.

For 10 years up to 2008, it declined between 30 and 50% in Spain, with indications of declines also in other parts of the range. It only hunts in watercourses and is therefore threatened by water pollution and the development of tourist infrastructure, which is expected to continue in the future. It is suspected that population declines are underway that will exceed 30% over 18 years (3 generations), and for that reason the species is considered Vulnerable under criterion A4bce.","The Long-fingered Bat (<em>Myotis capaccinii</em>)&#160;depends strictly on aquatic habitats. It forages over wetlands and waterways (including artifical waterbodies, such as canals and reservoirs), also scrub. It seems to prefer clutter-free water surfaces when foraging, probably because the echolocation of preys is facilitated above them (Almenar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).It generally roosts in underground habitats (principally caves). In the Balkans it is confined to karst areas. Movements between summer and winter colonies are mostly within a distance of 50 km (maximum 140 km: Hutterer <em>et al.</em> 2005).","Threats include changes in water quality through pollution and dam building, and loss of water bodies and watercourses.

At least six important colonies are threatened by the construction of buildings nearby and five colonies have disappeared over the last 10 years. In France the population has declined to very low numbers (an estimated 3,800 individuals). Colonies have been lost in the western part of the range in the last 15 years (S.

In Croatia there are still some large colonies but these are threatened by pollution of karstic water bodies (F. Spitzenberger pers. comm. 2006), and the species is listed as Endangered in the Croatian Red Book of Mammals (Tvrtkovic 2006).

Water pollution may also be a threat; the species already has a relatively restricted foraging habitat of broad, open flat water of canals, rivers and lakes with relatively open banks, with possibly some further  seasonal (summer) restriction within utilized habitat. Such restrictions in summer may be opportunistic rather than enforced, and it may be that the requirements for wider dispersal in spring, and possibly autumn, is more of a conservation problem than concentration in summer in good foraging habitat close to the roost.

The decline is observed from monitoring in Australia and inferred from  the impacts of exploitation, deforestation and habitat degradation in  Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Indonesia.<br/><br/>Generation length in the wild population has been estimated as 7-8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). In Australia, monthly population estimates from May 2004 to May  2019 (&lt;3 generations) show a strong and consistent decline in the  order of 75% (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2018). In PNG and Indonesia, where  population-wide estimates have not been made, the species is understood  to be seriously impacted by hunting and increasing rates of  deforestation and degradation of lowland forest from logging and  conversion to oil palm plantations (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Stibig <em>et al.</em> 2014, S. Hamilton, T. Leary and B. Roberts pers. comm.).","Most of the detailed information on roosting and feeding habitat is  based on studies from the Wet Tropics region of Australia. Further  research is required in the northern areas of the range extending into  PNG and Indonesia.<br/><br/><em>Pteropus conspicillatus</em> is found in a range of  habitats including Melaleuca swamp forest, wet and dry sclerophyll  forests and woodlands, mangrove, tropical savannah and tropical moist  forests (Duncan <em>et al.</em> 1999). It has been recorded in primary and  disturbed native vegetation, and in agricultural and urban areas. The  species roosts in colonies ranging in size from hundreds to thousands of  individuals (Bonaccorso 1998, DERM 2010, T. Leary pers. comm.). Roost  sizes in Australia are typically larger than in PNG and Indonesia.  Recent telemetry studies in the Wet Tropics have shown a low level of  solitary roosting (Westcott and McKeown 2014). There is evidence that  the proportion of animals in urban roost sites is increasing (Tait <em>et al.</em>  2014), although the overall population is in decline. <em>P. conspicillatus</em>  usually forms single-species colonies, although it occasionally  co-roosts with <em>P. scapulatus </em>and small numbers of <em>P. hypomelanus</em> and<em> P.  alecto</em> at a limited number of sites (Bonaccorso 1998, Parsons <em>et al.</em>  2010). In both Australia and PNG roosts can have a long history, &gt;80  years for some e.g., Tolga and &gt;20 years for many others (e.g.,  Gordonvale in Australia and Lae and Madang in PNG). This species  disperses widely and will occupy new, often temporary, roost sites,  particularly following cyclones (Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>The  diet is comprised primarily of floral and fruit resources obtained in a  broad variety of habitats, with nectar and pollen from myrtaceous  plants and fruit from Moraceae (e.g., <em>Ficus</em>) being the dominant taxa  (Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2006, DERM 2010).<br/><br/>Reproduction is seasonal and synchronous throughout the Australian range (Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Females give birth to a single young between October and December and mating occurs between March and May (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1996, Hall and Richards 2000, Shilton <em>et al.</em>  2008). The timing of reproduction outside of Australia has not been  systematically examined, but is believed to be similar (Flannery  1995a,b). Although some births have been observed during July and early  August in Madang, PNG (Bonaccorso 1998).<br/><br/>Results from population  monitoring, genetic and telemetry studies in the Wet Tropics indicate  frequent movement by individuals between roosts both daily and  seasonally (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2001, Parsons 2005, Fox 2006, Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015). Telemetry studies suggest that individual <em>P. conspicillatus  </em>likely range over much of the Wet Tropics during their life time and  individuals are known to fly up to 50 km from their roost in a single  night to feed, with longer distance movements between roosts recorded  over one and several nights (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2015). Movements between PNG and Australia have not been shown, but could possibly occur.","A range of threats have been identified for <em>P. conspicillatus</em>. Key  threats (also see table below) include habitat loss, exploitation,  harassment at roosts, electrocution, shooting in orchards, and tick  paralysis (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2001, DERM 2010, Dennis 2012, Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Decline  of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> in Australia has been associated with habitat  loss, and persecution such as electrocution and shooting at orchards  (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 1999, DERM 2010). The impact of lethal crop  protection is believed to have decreased in recent years with  prohibition of high voltage electricity grids and with the wide-spread  adoption of canopy netting on orchards. However, permits to shoot  flying-foxes for commercial crop protection were re-instated by the  Queensland government in 2012 after a four-year ban. Rates of clearing  of rainforest in the coastal and upland areas in the majority of the Wet  Tropics Bioregion have been reduced and are no longer significant  (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm.). However, there has  been an intensification of agriculture on the dry western margins of  the range and an increase in clearing of sclerophyll vegetation types  important for the species in these areas (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D.  Westcott pers. comm). Habitat loss for human development impacts coastal  areas and plateaus. Recent escalation in rates of transition of  sclerophyll vegetation types to closed rainforest has been documented  and attributed to changed fire management regimes (Stanton <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Conflict  between humans and <em>P. conspicillatus</em> in built up areas appears to be  growing as the proportion of the population using roosts in urban areas  increases (Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014). Methods for ameliorating conflict  typically include modification or removal of roosting vegetation and the  use of noise and other disturbances to disperse animals away from human  occupied areas. The long-term impact of dispersals on <em>P. conspicillatus</em>  is unknown. However, conflict at roosts hinders conservation measures.<br/><br/>More recently, tick paralysis has been identified as an increasing threat to the species (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2008, Fox 2011, Buettner <em>et al.</em> 2013). Buettner <em>et al.</em> (2013) found that mortality varied between years, with more adult females affected than males.<br/><br/><em>Pteropus  conspicillatus</em> are also threatened by mortality from entanglement in  backyard drape netting, collision and entanglement in barbed-wire  fences, electrocution on power lines, cleft palate and other birth  deformities (Richards <em>et al.</em> 2008, Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008, DERM 2010, J. Maclean pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The  impact of climate change is unclear but is likely to increase the  severity of cyclones and other extreme weather (i.e., heat events) that  can kill large numbers and impact the feeding and roosting habitat of  the species (DERM 2010). The recent invasion of myrtle rust and tramp  ants (electric and yellow crazy ants) into the Wet Tropics region is  also a concern for the future status of Wet Tropics species (Metcalfe <em>et al.</em>  2014). In PNG and Indonesia, the range of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> is  typically confined to coastal lowlands and islands. These areas are most  densely populated by people and subject to the most rapid land use  change as documented by remote sensing (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Stibig <em>et al.</em>  2014). Increasing rates of habitat loss or modification through  residential expansion and the clearing of large tracts of forests for  expanding oil palm production continue to be a major threat to the  species (T. Leary pers. comm.). Logging operations are also expanding in  the range of <em>P. conspicillatus</em>, particularly in the West Papua province  of Indonesia and the Madang and Morobe provinces of PNG (Stibig <em>et al.</em>  2014). Hunting is another significant threat as flying-foxes are an  important food source for many communities and sold as food at local  markets (Mack and West 2005, S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm., B.  Roberts pers. obs). In both Madang and Lae, <em>P. conspicillatus</em> are hunted  and disturbed on an almost daily basis (T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts  pers. obs.). <br/><br/>The impacts of these threats combined with the species’s low reproductive output (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2008) and the population’s low estimated average exponential rate of increase (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2018) highlight the likelihood of continual decline into the projected future.","Two subspecies are recognised: <em>Pteropus conspicillatus conspicillatus</em> (Australia and  northern and eastern PNG) and <em>P. c. chrysauchen</em> (Irian and Moluccan  populations, Indonesia) (Flannery 1995b, Bonaccorso 1998).<br/><br/>Population size in Australia in November 2004 was estimated at approximately 250,000 and declined to 75,000 in 2016 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2018). Additional monitoring in November 2018 showed further declines  and a population estimate of 44,000. There has been no systematic  monitoring of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> in PNG and Indonesia, and little is  known about total population size in this region. In PNG, the largest  known roosts of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> are in the built-up areas of Madang  and Lae. The numbers of animals at these two sites have been relatively  stable over the last few decades, with a combined population of  &lt;10,000 and roost estimates of 5,000-7,000 at Madang and 2,000-7,000  in Lae (Bonaccorso 1998, S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts  pers. obs). Roosts in other locations are small, ranging from a few  hundred to several hundred animals (S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers.  comm.). Anecdotal information indicates that the species is likely under  a high degree of pressure from hunting and habitat modification (S.  Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts pers. obs).",Decreasing,"This species has been recorded from the Moluccan Archipelago of  Indonesia (including the islands of Halmahera, Bacan, Obi, Misool, and  Gebe), it is present on Salawati Island (Indonesia), Waigeo Island, Biak  and Yapen islands (Indonesia), coastal areas of the island of New  Guinea (Irian Jaya, Indonesia and PNG), the D’Entrecasteaux Islands  (PNG), and the Louisade Archipelago (PNG). In Australia it ranges  patchily from Cape York (Iron and McIllwraith Ranges), to the Wet  Tropics Bioregion and through to coastal central Queensland between  Mackay and Rockhampton (Flannery 1995a,b; Bonaccorso 1998; Wiantoro  2011), with the main Australian population in the Wet Tropics (Shilton <em>et al.</em>  2008, Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management  (DERM) 2010). Records in PNG and Indonesia are from coastal lowland  habitats (&lt;200 m) except for one feeding observation at 1,000 m asl  (Flannery 1995b, Bonaccorso 1998, Wiantoro 2011). In Australia it roosts  and feeds at low to mid altitudes (generally &lt;750 m) and has been  found feeding as high as 1,100 m (D. Westcott and A. McKeown pers.  comm.).<br/><br/>Approximately 64 roost sites have been identified in the  Wet Tropics of Australia, but on average only 10 are occupied in any  month of the year (Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2018). In the Iron and McIllwrath Ranges of Northern Australia very  small numbers (&lt;1000) have been recorded irregularly, with no  identified permanent roosts (Fox 2011, D. Westcott and S. Fox pers.  comm.). In the Torres Strait there is one report of a juvenile <em>P.  conspicillatus</em> skull from Nepean Island (Anderson 1912), however recent  reviews of the literature and surveys have failed to confirm any  additional records of this species through the area (Lavery <em>et al.</em>  2012). In Indonesia and PNG less is known about the distribution and  occurrence of species, but the species appears to roost in small numbers  in coastal lowlands (Bonaccorso 1998, Wiantoro 2011).

However, the species qualifies for CR under the A2c criterion because best estimates indicate habitat loss has exceeded 80% over the past three generations (estimated generation length: 8.1 years/generation), because remaining habitat is increasingly degraded and fragmented, and because declines in the extent and quality of habitat are continuing.<br/><br/><em>P. livingstonii </em>also meets the Endangered threshold under a second criterion, B1. The geographic range is small, such that the current extent of occurrence is estimated to be 1,856 km², less than the EN threshold of 5,000 km² under criterion B1. In addition, the habitat is severely fragmented, and there have been clear, continuing, observed declines in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, habitat quality, and number of locations. Declines in number of mature individuals are also inferred from these declines in habitat. Therefore, this species would also be listed as EN under criterion B1ab(i, ii, iii, iv, v).","This species roosts in emergent trees, primarily on steep-sided valleys with south-east facing slopes, near ridge tops and in areas generally associated with natural vegetation (Granek 2002). <em>Ficus esperata</em>, <em>Girostpula</em> <em>comoriensis</em>, <em>Gambeya </em>spp., <em>Ficus lutea </em>and <em>Nuxia pseudodentata </em>are the five most commonly used species for roosting (Daniel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press.). Populations of this bat are largely confined to primary tropical moist forest (Mickleburgh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1992), especially montane areas. Specifically, on Anjouan, all the major roosts are restricted to a narrow mid-altitudinal range (600-960 m asl) and are strongly associated with the presence of native and endemic trees, with most of the largest roosts located in dense canopy, old growth forest (Granek 2002, Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Daniel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press.). The bats feed primarily on fruit, but also to a lesser degree on nectar and leaves (Trewhella <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, Sewall 2002). Feeding is principally on native species but also includes non-native kapok (<em>Ceiba pentandra</em>) (Trewhella <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, Sewall 2002); particularly important food sources are native <em>Ficus lutea </em>and <em>Ficus antandronarum </em>(Sewall 2002).","<em>Pteropus livingstonii </em>is threatened principally by the continuing degradation, fragmentation, and loss of its forest habitat (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Over the last few decades, the Comoros have undergone a sustained, rapid deforestation, resulting in the loss of nearly all its native forests. Data quality on rates of habitat loss is poor (FAO 2010), but best estimates are that during the past 20 years alone, the country has lost 75% of its remaining forests, the fastest rate of any country in the world (UNDP 2013). This habitat change is caused by cutting of trees for fuelwood and construction, and by conversion of all but the steepest upland areas to agricultural use (for subsistence agriculture and for export crops such as cloves) (Weightman 1987, Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011b, Doulton <em>et al</em>. 2015). With continuing habitat change, this species has retreated to higher elevations (above 450 m asl on Anjouan and above 250 m asl on Mohéli). Even above these elevations, forest habitat on both islands, and especially Anjouan, has undergone extensive and continuing habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, 2011a; R. Young unpublished), leaving large areas increasingly unsuitable for this species. Human pressures on native forests are expected to continue, as the growth rate of the human population remains high, with an annual increase of 2.5% (UNDP 2013).<br/><br/>Roost sites represent critical habitat for <em>Pteropus livingstonii </em>(Granek 2002, Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011b), yet tree felling has destroyed a number of roosts, leading to displacement of bats to less impacted areas, often at higher elevations (Trewhella <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011b). Of 23 roosts occupied in 2007 (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), three roosts have been abandoned due to clear felling of forest in the past five years, and only one new but very small roost (15 bats) has been uncovered despite extensive searching effort (Daniel <em><em>et al.</em></em> in prep.). This new roost was found in a patch of degraded forest at 1050 m, the first to be found at such a high elevation, and is believed to have been established very recently. On Anjouan, forest clearance, underplanting or significant soil erosion following deforestation upslope of the roost was found within 50 m of all but one of the 16 occupied roosts (Daniel <em><em>et al.</em></em> in prep.). Further, the replacement of native forests with agricultural lands on Anjouan and Mohéli may render formerly inaccessible roost sites on Anjouan and Mohéli more accessible, possibly exposing roosts to increased levels of human disturbance. Finally, the loss of native forests has resulted in impermanence or complete drying of nearly all rivers on Anjouan and many on Mohéli (Louette <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004, Fernandez Astudillo 2012). As <em>P. livingstonii</em> roosts are often associated with rivers and other humid environments, a factor which may be related to their thermal sensitivity (Granek 2002), this loss of rivers may additionally affect the quality of roosting habitat.<br/><br/>There is no evidence that the species is hunted for food (Trewhella <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005), a key factor affecting other fruit bat species (Mickleburgh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992). This may be due in part to cultural taboos among the majority of the population that surround consumption of fruit bats. However, the apparent lack of hunting may also be due in part to <em>P. livingstonii</em>’s habit of roosting in inaccessible areas remote from towns; some limited hunting of the other two fruit bat species in the Comoros has been occasionally recorded (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, B.J. Sewall, pers. obs.). It is unclear if the increased access to formerly inaccessible roost areas could expose the bats to any hunting pressure in the future, but any such hunting would likely first affect <em>P. livingstonii</em>’s congener, P<em>. seychellensis comorensis</em>, which sometimes roosts and forages in visible locations in or near towns.<br/><br/>The mean surface temperature of the Comoros is thought to have increased about 1° C since 1900 and is expected to increase by 1-3° C more by 2100 due to global climate change (IPCC 2013). It is unclear whether or how such changes will affect <em>P. livingstonii</em>, but since thermal characteristics are important components of roost suitability for this and other <em>Pteropus </em>species (Pierson and Rainey 1992, Granek 2002) predicted temperature increases could affect availability of suitable roosting habitat.<br/><br/><em>P. livingstonii</em>’s small population is found within a restricted range solely on two small, adjacent islands. The species is therefore susceptible to single threatening processes, like cyclones, that could simultaneously or rapidly affect its entire range (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Further, the species may have naturally taken advantage of elevational differences in tree fruiting phenology to compensate for seasonal variation in fruit availability (Sewall 2002). Thus, the loss of large areas of foraging habitat including all the lower parts of its elevational range, could result in seasonally restricted food availability.","Repeated simultaneous surveys of all 23 known roosts during 1998-2006 typically recorded about 1,200 bats (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007); many of these roosts were located as a result of the implementation of a national monitoring program (Trewhella <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005). Surveys have been conducted only sporadically since 2007, so it is unclear whether populations have changed recently. However, a survey conducted with sequential visits to all previously-known roosts in 2011 and 2012 estimated 1,300 bats across 22 roosts (Anjouan: 940 bats at 16 roosts, Mohéli: 360 bats at 6 roosts) (Daniel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press.). Colony size typically ranges from 15 to 150 individuals (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). The largest known roosts have sometimes reached about 250 individuals during the rainy season, but not all of these are mature individuals (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011 a,b).<br/><br/>Generation length for the wild population of <em>P. livingstonii </em>is unknown, but several demographic parameters can be derived from the studbook for captive bats of this species (Glendewar 2014). Bats of this species can be long-lived in captivity (e.g., one founder captured as an adult in 1992 is still alive and has now lived 22 years in captivity). Females do not reproduce during the first few years of life in captivity (minimum dam age at first reproduction = 3.4 years, mean dam age at first reproduction = 5.9 years), and the average age of females giving birth is elevated (of all dams born in captivity that have since died or are &gt;10 years of age, mean age when giving birth = 8.1 years). Thus, based on studbook data (Glendewar 2014), this last figure of 8.1 years represents our best estimate of the generation length of the captive population. This estimate may be conservative as most (75%) of these females are still alive and at least some presumably will reproduce again at a later age.<br/><br/>It is unclear to what extent the generation length of the captive population correlates with the generation length of the wild population of <em>P. livingstonii</em>. However, the generation length of captive <em>P. livingstonii</em> correlates well with the few published generation length values for wild populations of other <em>Pteropus </em>species. In a wild population of <em>P. poliocephalus</em>, generation length was estimated conservatively as 7.4 years (Tidemann and Nelson 2011), though the true generation length could be much higher. Further, a generation length of 5.0 years was estimated for a rapidly declining wild population of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> (Fox <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008); however, our calculations using these same data suggest that in a stable population, generation length for <em>P. conspicillatus</em> would be about 7.7 years. Thus, generation length values for the captive population of <em>P. livingstonii</em> correlate well with the only published generation length values for wild <em>Pteropus</em>. Further, an estimate derived from taxonomically-adjusted allometric equations for mammals suggests generation length for <em>P. livingstonii </em>is 8.1 years (Pacifici <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Thus, the captive estimate appears in line with estimates for wild populations, and we conservatively estimate the generation length in the wild population of <em>P. livingstonii</em> to be 8.1 years.<br/><br/>True changes in the population size of <em>P. livingstonii</em> are currently unknown, but are likely to be linked to changes in forest and underplanted forest habitat. Our estimates, derived from the little available data on forest loss rates (FAO 2010, UNDP 2013), suggest that habitat decline over the most recent three-generation (or 24.3-year) period was 83%. Thus, our best estimate of loss of <em>P. livingstonii </em>habitat exceeds the threshold under the A2 criterion for CR status (≥80% loss of population, as suspected by habitat change, over a three-generation period, where habitat loss is ongoing).",Decreasing,"<em>P. livingstonii </em>is endemic to the Union of the Comoros, where it is only found on the islands of Anjouan and Mohéli. The species roosts and forages primarily in native forest and underplanted forest, and avoids areas heavily affected by human disturbance. On Anjouan the species avoids all lower elevations on the island (lowest record of feeding is 300 m asl), but on Mohéli some limited forest patches extend to near sea level (lowest record of feeding is 40 m asl). However, nearly all lower-elevation native forests have been lost, and in the past five years, there have been no records of this species below approximately 450 m on Anjouan or below 200 m on Mohéli (Daniel <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press.).<br/><br/>The Extent of Occurrence (calculated as the minimum convex polygon around area above minimum observed altitude above sea level on each of the two islands) is estimated as 1,856 km².&#160; This includes unsuitable areas of land and ocean located between patches of suitable habitat.<br/><br/>The total land area of Anjouan and Mohéli is a combined 635 km² (Louette <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2004). However, not all this area is occupied by <em>P. livingstonii</em>. The species is found within a combined area on the two islands ranging from 99.1 km² (minimum convex polygons around all known currently occupied long-term roost sites: Anjouan = 90.2 km² Mohéli = 8.9 km²) to 462.5 km² (minimum convex polygons around all potential but unconfirmed foraging and roosting areas in native forest, degraded forest and agroforestry habitats above the lowest elevation of recent sightings on each island [450m-1050m asl on Anjouan, and above 200m asl on Moheli]: Anjouan = 326.9 km², Mohéli = 135.6 km²) (Daniel <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press.). These two figures represent the possible range of this species on the two islands it inhabits. This represents a substantial decline over the past five years.<br/><br/>A land cover classification conducted in 2012 using high resolution satellite imagery and exenstive ground-truthing (ECDD, BCSF and Durrell, 2013) found the combined area of native forest (i.e. forest with little trace of human impact and a closed canopy) on both islands was 54.7 km² (29.6 km² in Anjouan; 25.1 km² in Moheli). The combined area of native forest and degraded forest (i.e. forest either underplanted with crops, or with localised logging or clearance for fuelwood) on both islands was 143.1 km². <br/><br/>Within the smallest total range on both islands (the area around all known currently occupied long-term roost sites), the Area of Occupancy or surface area of potentially occupied habitat (i.e. native and degraded forest and agroforestry habitats that could be used for either roosting and foraging) is estimated to be 65.0 km² (Anjouan = 56.8 km², Moheli = 8.2 km²). Within the largest total range on both islands, the equivalent estimate for Area of Occupancy is 188.4 km² (Anojuan = 114.07 km², Moheli = 74.34 km²). Thus, the estimated total Area of Occupancy for this species is 65.0 - 188.4 km².",,Terrestrial,"A detailed conservation plan for the species, the <em>Conservation Action Plan for Livingstone’s Flying Fox</em> (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007) was developed by the non-governmental organizations Action Comores Anjouan and Action Comores International, and a consortium of other conservation groups, through a participatory process involving a broad range of stakeholders. The plan identifies a conservation strategy with several key elements, including habitat protection, forest management, environmental education, population monitoring, ecological research, <em>ex-situ</em> breeding, and conservation partnerships. This conservation plan was adopted by the government of the Union of the Comoros as the national conservation strategy for this species and has served as a guide for conservation action.<br/><br/>A long-term comprehensive citizen science program involving Comorian villagers in population monitoring for this species was led by Action Comores Anjouan and Action Comores International between 1992 and 2006. Population surveys and habitat evaluation around roost sites was conducted by Engagement Communautaire pour le Développement Durable of the Bristol Zoological Society and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust between 2009 and 2012, and by Dahari more recently. A national environmental education programme was implemented by Action Comores Anjouan and Action Comores International, and it was successful in raising local and international awareness of this species and the threats it faces, in improving training of local personnel, and in increasing local participation in conservation and science programs (Trewhella <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). A small community-based ecotourism program for this species has been implemented on Mohéli by Projet Conservation de la Biodiversité et Développement Durable and local communities and is maintained by the local community in Ouallah 2 (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, Doulton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Dahari is implementing integrated landscape management around the southern forest block of Anjouan; this involves sustainable land management at the roosting and foraging habitat of this species and a pilot program of payment for ecosystem services both within the Moya Forest area (Doulton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).&#160; Research by Dahari and partners into feeding ecology and the genetics of roost-site populations is also planned. <br/><br/>There is an active captive-breeding programme underway for this species, initiated by Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in 1992. The program began with 17 founder individuals (7 females and 10 males) captured from the wild on Anjouan during 1992-1995 (Clark <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The captive population of <em>P. livingstonii</em> subsequently expanded at a slower rate than other fruit bat species in captive breeding programs (e.g., <em>P. rodricensis</em>), at least initially (O’Brien 2011). However, by 2014, the <em>P. livingstonii </em>captive population had reached 59 individuals (22 females and 37 males) housed at four institutions (Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust [Jersey, U.K.]; Bristol, Clifton, and West of England Zoological Society [Bristol, U.K.]; North of England Zoological Society [Chester, U.K.]; and Lisieux Cerza [Lisieux, France])(Glenewar 2014).<br/><br/>This species receives the highest level of legal protection available within the Union of the Comoros. It is listed as an ‘integrally-protected species’ (list 1 of RFIC 2001), which prohibits the capture or detention of <em>P. livingstonii </em>individuals without a permit. This law also expressly prohibits the killing of flying fox individuals; transport, purchase, sale, export or re-export of live or dead flying fox individuals or body parts; all disruption during the period of reproduction and raising of young; and the destruction of roosts (RFIC 2001). The Union of the Comoros also ratified the <em>Convention on Biological Diversity </em>in 1994, and in response has developed a <em>National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy</em> (Roby and Dossar 2000). This strategy highlights the importance of, threats to, and conservation recommendations for fruit bats of the Union of the Comoros (Sewall and Granek 2000). <em>P. livingstonii</em> is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES (UN 1973), which prevents international trade in specimens of this species without a permit. In practice, however, enforcement activities within the Comoros for these laws and treaties have been very limited in scope (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/><em>P. livingstonii </em>also does not occur in any protected areas. However, critical roosting habitat at seven key roost sites that together harboured more than half the population was identified during the development of the conservation action plan (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). Habitat conservation of these roost sites was identified as a key goal in this plan. As part of its implementation, Action Comores Anjouan and the Comoros Forest Reserves Project conducted a conservation assessment to identify the two highest-priority sites (roost sites Yiméré on Anjouan and Hassera-Ndrengé on Mohéli), where the establishment of protected areas for roost habitat would be both highly beneficial to biodiversity conservation and highly feasible (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011a). These two groups also completed conservation planning for protection of critical roosting habitat at all seven of these critical roost sites (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b). Implementation efforts by Action Comores Anjouan and partners to conserve habitat around critical roosting habitat on Anjouan and Mohéli are under development. A project to establish larger reserves to protect rainforest and cloud forest on both Anjouan and Mohéli, which would include roosting and foraging habitat for this species, has been proposed by the United Nations Development Programme, the Global Environmental Facility, and the Comorian government. The success of habitat conservation and restoration efforts will be particularly critical to the long-term prospects for this species.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

22085511,18751,Pteropus poliocephalus,Vulnerable,A2ace+4ac,2021,2021-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Grey-headed Flying Fox is assessed as Vulnerable under criteria A2ace and A4ac because, although the  population is relatively large (exceeding 10,000  mature individuals) and it has a large extent of occurrence (&gt;  20,000 km²), a continuing population decline is inferred to be  more than 30–35% over the last three generations (21 years, GL = 7  years; Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). A decline is also expected to  exceed 30% over the period encompassing the past 1 and at least two future generations (2014–2035).<br/><br/>The decline in population is inferred from  substantial loss and degradation of foraging habitat due to fire and  clearing, mass mortalities associated with extreme heat and food  shortages, and mortality from electrocution on power lines, and  entanglement in barbed wire and fruit tree netting. In particular,  extreme weather conditions in 2019-20 saw tens of thousands of  individuals die from food shortages and extreme heat events, and  unprecedented megafires affected 33.7% of the species’ total habitat  whereby 41.7% of the species' critical ‘winter’ foraging resources were  lost to high severity fires.<br/>The rate of decline is expected to  increase over at least the future two generations due to the increasing  frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events such as  heat events, droughts, floods and fires, along with changes in the  production of nectar, pollen and fleshy fruits in native vegetation,  largely unregulated land clearing associated with urban expansion,  agriculture intensification and human population growth, and increased  exposure of the species to anthropogenic threats in urban environments.  The capacity of the species to recover from increased mortality caused  by frequent or persistent threats is hampered by their low reproductive  rate, and low population growth rate even under optimal conditions.","The Grey-Headed Flying Fox is found in subtropical moist forest, open  forest, closed and open woodlands, Melaleuca swamps, Banksia woodlands,  mangroves, commercial fruit plantations (Hall and Richards 2000), and  increasingly in urban landscapes (e.g., Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021, Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  diet consists of nectar, pollen and fruits of a wide range of species,  most commonly native trees in the families Myrtaceae, Moraceae,  Proteaceae and a small number of species from other families. (Eby 1998,  Hall and Richards 2000, Eby and Law 2008, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em>  2009). The primary native food sources are the nectar and pollen of  <em>Eucalyptus</em>, <em>Corymbia</em>, <em>Angophora</em>, <em>Banksia</em>, <em>Melaleuca</em> species, and fleshy  rainforest fruits (Eby and Law 2008, Eby 1991); and they are known to  consume leaves, bark, and invertebrates (Clulow and Blundell 2011, Smith  <em>et al.</em> 2020, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em> 2009). They also forage  in agricultural areas, including orchards, and in introduced vegetation  in urban areas (McDonald-Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  majority of native diet plants have regular seasonal flowering  phenologies, but do not flower every year (Eby and Law 2008).  Grey-headed flying foxes experience seasonal food bottlenecks during  winter and spring when few diet plants are productive and the  distribution of native foraging habitat is limited (Eby and Law 2008).  Vegetation communities that contain plants that flower in winter and  early spring are of particular importance to the species during critical  periods in the reproductive cycle and have been identified as habitat  critical to survival (Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999, Eby and Law 2008, DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox lacks biological adaptations such as torpor to  withstand food shortages, instead individuals are thought to move in  response to changes in local food abundance (DAWE 2021). It is a highly  mobile species with individuals estimated to travel up to  2,500 km annually within a network of roosts located across southeastern  Australia (Eby 1991, Tidemann and Nelson 2004, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). On a nightly basis, individual bats may forage as far as 50 km  from their roost. However, mean foraging distances are between 6 and 11  km, with foraging distances shorter in urban than in non-urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021). There are few areas within the range where  nectar and other food sources are available continuously, except perhaps  in urban areas. While many flying-foxes feed in urban areas and urban  roosts may be permanently occupied, a proportion of the individuals  within these roosts move regularly between urban and other more natural  settings (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>It roosts by day colonially in  canopy vegetation and many roosts have a long history of use (Lunney and  Moon 1997). Individuals move nomadically throughout the species' range  within a network of roosts, and change roosts frequently (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Some roosts may temporarily contain &gt;100,000 individuals,  often coinciding with periodic flowering of preferred tree species (Eby  1991, Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;regularly  cohabits roosts with the black flying fox (<em>P. alecto</em>) and Little Red Flying Fox (<em>P. scapulatus</em>) with which it is partially sympatric (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021), and rarely with the Spectacled Flying Fox (<em>P. conspicillatus</em>) in the north of its range (Parsons <em>et al.</em>  2010). Of the 310 known camps in regular use, almost 75% are shared  with other species and only 25% are occupied exclusively by the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Timmiss <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The majority of camps (58.7%) are located in urban areas (Timmiss <em>et al.</em>  2021). From 1998 to 2019, the number of active roost sites increased by  approximately 120% and average population size at camps declined, with  94% of new roosts formed in urban areas (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  The pattern of increase in roost numbers has been stepped rather than  continuous, in association with periods of food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em>  submitted). The drivers of increasing urbanisation of the species are  unclear. Increased temporal stability (Markus and Hall 2004,  McDonald‐Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Parry‐Jones and Augee 2001, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006) and availability (Markus and Hall 2004, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em>  2006) of food resources from urban plantings may be responsible for the  recently observed increased presence of flying-foxes of urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021), however, broadscale reductions in feeding  opportunities in native habitats may also play a role (Parry-Jones and  Augee 2001, van der Ree <em>et al.</em> 2006, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014, P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  the roosts, males establish ‘mating territories’ that are actively  maintained by aggression, which is especially evident during the mating  season (March-May, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993; Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995; Eby 1995; Nelson 1965; Welbergen 2010, 2011). Males mate repeatedly  with the same female during a mating session and can have multiple  mating sessions with the same female over the course of several days  (Welbergen 2005). Males, but not females, accumulate body mass prior to  establishing their territories and can lose more than 20 percent of  their mass during the mating season (Welbergen 2011).&#160;&#160; <br/>The most likely time of conception is April (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995). Pregnancy in <em>P. poliocephalus</em> is seasonal, lasts for approximately 27 weeks (Martin <em>et al.</em>  1987) and the majority of females give birth to a single young annually  between late September and early November, although small numbers of  females give birth outside this time (Justin Welbergen pers. comm.).  Lactation lasts approximately 5–6 months (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1996), with the majority of young being weaned by the start of the mating season in March (Welbergen 2011).<br/><br/>Twins  are rare and there are no observations of twins surviving to weaning  (Peggy Eby pers. comm.). Sexual maturity is reached in the second year  (females) or third year (males) after birth (Welbergen 2010), and  generation length is estimated to be between 6 and 8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Divljan pers. comm).","Grey-Headed Flying Foxes are exposed to significant threats from  increasingly rapid human-induced environmental change, particularly loss  of foraging habitat and climate change impacts (DAWE 2021). They are  also impacted by increasing levels of conflict with humans at urban  roosts (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021). Key threats often act concurrently  and their impacts on population size are exacerbated by the species’ low  reproductive output, limiting its capacity to recover from impacts  (McIlwee and Martin 2002). Threats are predicted to increase in  frequency and severity in coming decades and, as a result, rates of  decline are expected to increase (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The  species is dependent on continuous access to flowering and fruiting food  plants sourced from widespread areas of native vegetation. Reduction in  food availability from loss and degradation of native habitat and  impacts of climate change, particularly drought and fires, is a key  threat (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, DAWE 2021). Incremental clearing  of critical winter/spring foraging habitat for urban expansion and  agriculture intensification is largely unregulated and is ongoing in  many regions. For example, loss of critical winter habitat was  associated with a collapse in winter influxes of nomadic animals into  far southeast Queensland from 1996 to 2018 (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>Climate-driven  food shortages affect the species throughout its range and are  associated with population-wide increases in mortality (assessed from  rates of intake by wildlife rehabilitation organizations) and reductions  in pre-weaning reproductive success (DAWE 2021, Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted, Mo <em>et al.</em>  2021). Food shortages were recorded every 3 years on average from 1998  to 2020 (range 1-4 years) and were associated with absence or very low  intensity of flowering in native forests (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  Food shortage impacts are generally global across the range of the  species and pre-weaning reproductive success assessed over 23 years  (1998 to 2021) and averaged across roosts in New South Wales was 56% in  food shortage years relative to 89% in non-food shortage years (P. Eby  unpublished data). This represents only a partial assessment of impact,  as adult female mortality was not considered in the denominators. Roosts  affected by the impact of extreme heat were not included in the data.  Repeated reductions in reproduction may reduce the capacity of the  species to recover from decline.<br/><br/>Extreme heat events, whereby  ambient temperatures exceed 42°, are known to cause mass mortality of  flying-foxes at landscape scales, and this has become a prominent  conservation management issue in Australia. Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  (2008) reported that between 1994 and 2008, &gt;30,000 Australian  flying-foxes, of which 24,500 were <em>P. poliocephalus</em>, had died during 19  separate extreme heat events. Between 2008 and 2019 a further 131.00  flying foxes died in several such events, including &gt;40,000 <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals (Welbergen 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  unpublished). During the 2019-20 summer, 72,000 flying foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events, with <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals comprising the majority of the mortality  estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The recorded deaths are likely  substantial underestimates of the true mortality as many roosts are not  inspected following events and where inspected mortality is often  underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.). Adult  females and dependent young are disproportionately susceptible to  hyperthermia, which negatively affects recruitment and the effective  breeding population limiting the species’ capacity for recovery  (Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Wildfires have also recently gained  significance as threats to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox. During the  extreme Austral 2019–20 summer, unprecedented bushfires affected an  estimated 5.8 Mha of temperate broadleaf forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning 33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7%  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires  (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts  of the 2019-2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both  the short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire. At present, there are insufficient data available to  estimate the impact on the <em>P. poliocephalus </em>population or predict its  trajectory of post-fire recovery.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme  heat events and associated droughts and wildfires are already readily  observable in southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to  escalate in frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021,  Herold <em>et al.</em> 2021). As such, the already substantial die-offs  from food shortages and extreme heat, and habitat loss from wildfires  are anticipated to continue to gain significance as threats to the  species.<br/><br/>The recent urbanisation of roosts exposes the species to  several threats. Conflict between people and Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;is  an ongoing problem that may cause loss or degradation of roosting  habitat and reduce community support for conservation initiatives (DAWE  2021). Flying-foxes are commonly perceived to be an annoyance, or  disease risk due to the noise and smell they emit and camps close to  human settlements are regularly subject to attempts to exclude the bats,  or clear vegetation in or around roosts to manipulate fine-scale  roosting positions (DAWE 2021, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Other threats include entanglement in fruit tree netting or  barbed wire fencing, electrocution on power lines, and vehicle  collisions. In a study of 532 Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;admitted to  emergency care in Victoria, Scheelings and Frith (2015) found  anthropogenic factors caused the majority (63.7%) of admissions, with  entanglement in fruit tree netting the most common cause (36.8%)  followed by entanglement in barbed wire fencing (12.4%). Roosts once  isolated from humans have become embedded in urban areas due to  increasing urban expansion in coastal New South Wales and Queensland  (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Grey-Headed Flying Foxes may cause damage to fruit  crops in both commercial and backyard orchards, and lethal control  methods were commonly used in the past, including electrocution and  shooting (DAWE 2021). Historically culling was a major cause of  mortality (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, there have been  efforts to reduce the number of flying-foxes killed by orchardists  through Government subsidised netting programs, and overall, the impact  of this threat has declined. Queensland still issues permits to cull up  to 1,280 individuals per year (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Interspecific competition  with the black flying fox (<em>Pteropus alecto</em>) may also be a threat to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b). Although there is no evidence of interspecific competition, the  black flying fox has been expanding both in range and abundance in the  northern parts of the Grey-Headed Flying Fox’s range (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a).<br/>Apart from culling by orchardists, all other threats are likely to continue or increase in severity and impact into the future.","This species forms a single, extremely mobile, interbreeding population distributed over a vast area (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;was considered abundant and estimated to number  in the many millions in the early 20th century (Ratcliffe 1931).  However, distribution-wide autumn population counts, based on counts of  individuals at known camps across the species range, varied between  320,000 and 674,000 (mean of 450,714) between 1989 and 2005 (Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). Subsequently a national program of largely synchronous quarterly  population estimates was established in November 2012 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015), and its autumn population counts varied between 522,000 and  663,000 (mean 570.900) over the period 2013-2019 (NFFMP, 2021). However,  counts from the periods 1989-2005 and 2013-2019 are not directly  comparable because of the differences in the methods used and  uncertainty about the survey coverage of the extent of the population  (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition, distribution-wide counts  lack precision due to the unknown proportion of individuals at unsampled  camps, and inconsistencies in sampling effort and counting methods used  among individual roost sites (DAWE 2021, Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015). Due to limited precision, the time taken to reach 80%  statistical power in detecting trends in the recent distribution-wide  counts has been modelled to be ~13.5 years, or until 2027 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2012). However, recent work suggests that the main method used for  counting individuals in roosts is much less precise than was assumed in  the modelling (McCarty <em>et al.</em> submitted). While efforts are currently underway to improve the reliability of count estimates (McCarthy <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, McCarthy <em>et al.</em>  submitted), until precision of the distribution-wide counts is improved  and better defined, it is not possible to establish meaningful trends  using current timeframes of population monitoring.<br/><br/>During the austral  spring and summer of 2019–2020, <em>P. poliocephalus </em>was exposed to a  sequence of circumstances associated with prolonged drought and extreme  heat, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021), near reproductive failure and the burning of over a third of its habitat (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/> <br/>At  this time, the species experienced an extended and intense food  shortage across a broad area of northern New South Wales and  southeastern Queensland, resulting in a large but unquantified number of  flying-fox deaths, possibly in the tens of thousands based on anecdotal  reports from wildlife carers (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). Pre-weaning reproduction at that time fell to 6% from a 21-year average of 74% (P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  addition, in the summer of 2019–2020, 72,000 flying-foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events throughout  eastern and southeastern Australia, with <em>P. poliocephalus</em> comprising the  majority of the mortality estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The  recorded deaths are likely substantial underestimates of the true  mortality as many roosts are not inspected following events and where  inspected mortality is often underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Furthermore,  in the summer of 2019–20, unprecedented bushfires affected an estimated  5.8 million hectares of forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning  33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7% of the species'  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires (Baranowski  <em>et al.</em> 2021).

In conjunction with other ongoing causes of decline that  contributed to the species’ previous listing as Vulnerable under  criteria A2ace, these extreme events are anticipated to amount to a  decline in mature individuals exceeding 30% over the period <em>ca</em> 2014–2035, equivalent to the previous one and future two generations under criteria  A4.",Decreasing,"The geographic range of the species has altered in the past 20 years as documented by range-wide monitoring (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2012), satellite telemetry studies (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020), a systematic search of field records (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b) and public reporting. While latitudinal range boundaries have remained generally stable (Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b), there has been a distinct inland expansion. As of 2021 the  range spans the coastal lowlands, tablelands, and slopes of eastern  Australia, from Finch Hatton near Mackay (Queensland) in the north to  Melbourne, Geelong (Victoria) in the south (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b, Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014) and inland to Port Augusta in South Australia, Cooma in the Snowy  Mountains of New South Wales (New South Wales), and areas of central  and southern New South Wales and Victoria including Dubbo, Wagga Wagga  and Albury (New South Wales), Numurkah and Bendigo (Victoria). There  have also been vagrant sightings outside of this range, including  occasional sightings in Tasmania and Bass Strait islands (Atlas of  Living Australia 2021, DAWE 2021). Sightings in Tasmania and islands in  Bass Strait are associated with periods of acute food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  great majority of observations and camps of this species are from the  coastal lowlands and slopes of south eastern Australia below altitudes  of about 200 m (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data).  However, known roosts vary in elevation from sea level to 800 m (Cooma),  and occasionally vagrant individuals have been reported from altitudes  up to 1,600 m in the New South Wales and Victorian high country (M.  Pennay pers. comm., Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data). Along the  southern periphery of its range, the species has increased in abundance  in urban areas including Canberra (Australian Capital Territory),  Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo (Victoria), and Adelaide (South  Australia) (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The species is typically  found from sea level to 800 m asl, with vagrants being documented up to  1,600 m asl.","The species is not known to be hunted, used, or traded.",Terrestrial,"This species is known to use a broad range of areas reserved for  conservation, which make up 12.6% of the area surrounding known camps,  however, only 5.2% of the camps occur within conservation areas (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Given the species' reliance on dispersed food  resources, conservation areas are unlikely to protect sufficient habitat  for the species.<br/><br/>A range of management actions and research to  assist conservation of <em>P. poliocephalus</em> into the future has been  identified in the National Recovery Plan for the species (DAWE 2021).  They include: identify, protect and increase roosting habitat and native  foraging habitat that is critical to survival, define and improve  precision in current population monitoring to determine reliable trends  in population size, build community capacity to coexist with flying  foxes and improve management of conflict at roosts in urban areas,  reduce the impact of electrocution on power lines, and entanglement in  netting and on barbed wire, significantly reduce levels of harm in  commercial fruit crops, support research that will improve conservation  and management, develop and apply ameliorative care procedures to  minimise deaths during extreme heat days, and management of fire (DAWE  2021).<br/><br/>In recent years, governments have funded and administered a  number of programs of subsidies to improve conservation outcomes for <em>P.  poliocephalus</em>. Plans of Management for several roosts have been  developed by land managers in consultation with affected stakeholders  (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012). The plans set out programs for managing  contentious roosts under various conditions, and can serve as effective  mechanisms for both reducing conflict and educating the public about the  conservation and management challenges that face <em>P. poliocephalus</em>.  Government subsidies in New South Wales have enabled commercial  orchardists to install full exclusion netting to protect their crops  from flying fox damage in advance of a halt to licenced culling on  crops.

Invasive plants including the Kudzu Vine (<em>Pueraria phaseoloides</em>) and coconut scrub from abandoned plantations threaten remaining suitable habitat for this species. Kudzu Vine threatens to overgrow roost cave entrances or to change the temperature gradient within caves (Gerlach and Taylor 2004).

Animals have been found roosting singly or in small groups of up to 12 individuals, often sharing caves with several other bat species, especially other species of <em>Hipposideros </em>(Flannery 1995, Bonaccorso 1998). It is the most robust leaf-nosed bat in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, weighing 70-80 grams. It is believed to hunt from perches on vegetation, flying out to catch invertebrate prey (Lavery<em> et al.</em> 2016). Its robust dentition and relatively low frequency (52–55 kHz) echolocation call suggest it hunts for larger prey.<br/><br/>Genetic sequencing has revealed genetic divergence between sympatric <em>Hipposideros dinops </em>and <em>H. diadema</em> is less than that between <em>H. diadema </em>samples from the Solomon Islands and mainland Papua New Guinea (Lavery 2014). However, where <em>H. dinops</em> and <em>H. diadema</em> co-occur on Guadalcanal, Santa Isabel and in the Western Province they are reproductively isolated. <em>Hipposideros dinops</em> is easily distinguished by its larger size and distinctive long duration, relatively low frequency, echolocation call (Lavery 2015, Pennay and Lavery 2017). It is believed that <em>H. dinops</em> has undergone recent, rapid speciation, diverging from <em>H. diadema</em> in the past 1–2 million years (Lavery <em>et al.</em> 2014).","This species is likely threatened by extensive logging, particularly in the Solomon Islands, where it is estimated almost all accessible (lowland) forests have been logged (Katovai <em>et al. </em>2015). Mining may cause localised loss of habitat. Cave disturbance is also a threat, many locations are visited by hunters, and in Guadalcanal major disturbances (excavation, and fires) have been observed in caves used by this species caused by prospectors searching for rumoured treasures buried by Japanese forces in WWII. The species is not usually hunted for food, but given its large body size, it is taken opportunistically when hunting for other bats (e.g., <em>Dobsonia inermis</em>) inside caves.<br/><br/>Invasive species, particularly Little Fire Ant (<em>Wasmannia auropunctata</em>), which has become widespread on some islands and is likely to be affecting both food resources and causing direct mortality for the species. It is also likely to be predated by introduced cats and rats.","The Fierce Leaf-nosed Bat is uncommon; it occupies a very limited number  of caves and is absent from many apparently suitable caves (Flannery  1995, Lavery pers comm.). Where it is found, it occurs at low densities  with small numbers, usually &lt;12 (Flannery 1995, Bonaccorso 1998). This bat's echolocation call has only recently been described (Pennay  and Lavery 2017) and acoustic surveys may reveal it is easily detected  where it occurs. Pennay and Lavery (2017) reported that its call was  recorded with regularity amongst free flying bats in acoustic recordings  of free flying bats on Guadalcanal and Choiseul Islands (Solomon  Islands), however these recordings were undertaken in close proximity to  caves known to be used by the species. Only a single <em>Hipposideros  dinops </em>call was recorded at 223 m asl, at Kunua, during acoustic bat  surveys on the west coast of Bougainville (J. Novera pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The  number of mature individuals over its range is unknown, however  it is estimated to be fewer than 6,000. The population is divided into six  subpopulations: Bougainville, Choiseul, Isabel, Malaita, Guadalcanal  and the New Georgia (group) representing a distinct subpopulation with  sea crossings between these major islands extremely rare. The number of  mature individuals in each subpopulation is estimated to be fewer than  1,000 mature individuals. The taxonomic relationships between different  island sub-populations are also complex, and each should probably be  regarded as evolutionary significant units for the genus <em>Hipposideros </em> (T. Lavery pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The population is inferred to be declining  based on observed patterns of decline in other island endemic bat  species with small geographic ranges (Lavery <em>et al.</em> 2020) and the  extensive habitat loss and degradation across the main islands in its  range. More than 40% of Bougainville’s lowland forest has been lost or  degraded over the last half century (Woxvold and Novera 2021) and  unsustainable logging in the Solomon Islands has occurred in almost all  accessible lowland rainforest (Katovai <em>et al.</em> 2015). The rate of decline is likely to continue and intensify as logging rates increase on all islands.",Decreasing,"The Fierce Leaf-nosed Bat is present on the islands of Bougainville (Papua New Guinea), Choiseul, New Georgia, Nggatokae Island, Santa Isabel, San Jorge, and Malaita (all in the Solomon Islands). On these islands it appears to be restricted to a few caves and surrounding lowland rainforest habitats from sea level to about 400 m asl (Flannery 1995, Bonaccorso 1998). Only 1 or 2 caves are known to be used by this species in each of the major island groups, although it is likely that unknown caves also exist. The species is dependent on a very small number of caves on each major island group, resulting in an area of occupancy of <em>ca</em> 240–400 km² over six disconnected islands.","The species is not known to be used or traded.

Almost  qualifies as threatened under criterion A. However, as this species is  generally widespread across Madagascar, occurs both in and outside a  number of protected areas, and has an ability to tolerate some degree of  habitat modification, it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to  warrant listing in a threatened category.","This species is found in a wide variety of vegetation types, including dry deciduous, littoral and gallery forests (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Raharinantenaina <em>et al</em>. 2008, Goodman and Ramasindrazana 2013). It roosts in large colonies in caves and in solitary settings on the peripheral branches of large trees (Cardiff 2006, Goodman 2006, Raharinantenaina <em>et al</em>. 2008). In sites with extensive networks of underground cavities, <em>H. commersoni</em> only occupies a few of the potential roosting caves (Cardiff 2006) and in Parc National d’Ankarana used rather narrow caves within 100 m of water (Cardiff 2006). It often uses buildings as night roosts or feeding perches. This species is known to use the edge and interiors of relatively intact forest, and has also been caught feeding in and around small villages (Ifticene <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kofoky <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rakotoarivelo and Randrianandriananina 2007, Raharinantenaina <em>et al</em>. 2008). Further study is therefore required on its forest dependency, but there is evidence that mature native forest trees are an essential habitat resource for <em>H. commersoni</em> in areas without caves (Raharinantenaina <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>It is a specialist beetle predator and appears to be inactive during the austral winter (Razakarivony <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kofoky <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rakotoarivelo <em>et al</em>. 2007) and may even be migratory (Ranivo and Goodman 2007, Ramasindrazana <em>et al</em>. 2015).

It is a widespread species with a broad distribution throughout Southeast Asia, as well as parts of South Asia and Oceania, surpassing the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy requirements to classify as a vulnerable species. There is a presumed large population of <em>H. diadema</em> due to broad distribution. It is suspected to be experiencing a low-level decline due to significant habitat loss and cave disturbances throughout its range, although that decline is unlikely to be at a rate great enough to qualify the species for listing in a threatened category.</p>","<p>The species primarily roosts in caves, but has also been found roosting  in buildings, hollow trees, under palms, and underground chambers (Nowak  1999, Francis 2019). Within a crowded cave, <em>H. diadema</em> may roost on  walls or near the floor of wet caves (Bonoccorso 1998). In Australia, it  was recorded within three different cave types including fully  developed tourist caves, self-guided/underdeveloped tourist caves, and  non-tourist caves (Pavey 1998). On the Nicobar Islands, it has been  recorded in bunkers with a colony size of 20-25, as well as colony sizes  greater than 150 within caves (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). Maternity  colonies of 8,000 <em>H. diadema</em> have been observed in Papua New Guinea  (Bonoccorso 1998). Further, it is known to roost with other species in  colonies that may reach over 100,000 individuals (Payne <em>et al.</em> 1985). It has been recorded roosting with <em>Rhinolophus affinis</em> at a cave in Penggerukan, North Sumatra (Whitten <em>et al.</em>  2000). In the Philippines, it was found to co-exist with other species  in caves including <em>Hipposideros pygmaeus</em>, <em>Rhinolophus arcuatus</em>,  <em>Rhinolophus virgo</em>, and <em>Rousettus amplexicaudatus</em> (Nuñeza and Galorio  2014), and co-roost with <em>Pipistrellus javanicus</em> (Galorio and Nuñeza  2014). Individuals were found to use multiple day roosts but did not  change roost every day (Pavey 1998). Ectoparasite loads among <em>H. diadema</em>  was recorded to be lowest among individuals within more complex caves  and lower densities (Phelps and Kingston 2018), as close contact among  females in maternity colonies has been shows to increase parasitism  transmission (Christe <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>It forages in various  forested habitats, including highly disturbed areas (Francis 2019). A  study in Australia found some flexibility in its foraging ecology, as  some individuals occupied up to three types of vegetation including an  open forest and vine thicket, although woodland was the most common  (Pavey 1998). However, they still required similar habitat components  among each type, specifically an area with leafless twigs for perching  overlooking an open space. Its wing morphology and high constant  echolocation frequency of 59-66kHz are more efficient for foraging in  densely vegetated habitats, as higher frequency calls rapidly attenuate  in air (Denzinger and Schnitzler 2013). Therefore, they are less  effective in locating prey in more open forests or disturbed habitats  such as coffee plantations (Kingston 2003, Meijaard 2005). According to  Huang <em>et al.</em> (2019), species similar to <em>H. diadema</em> that roost in  caves and have higher constant-frequency calls are more tolerant to  coffee plantations than plant-roosting species with lower  broadband-frequency calls. However, <em>H. diadema </em>is still less likely to  be found in an open disturbed habitat such as a coffee plantation, as  vegetation simplification decreases prey availability (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em>  2004), limits their echolocation efficiency and may increase predation  pressure (Gardner 1998). This hypothesis is supported in a study by  Huang <em>et al.</em> (2014) that only recorded sightings <em>H. diadema</em>  within the primary rainforests of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park,  Sumatra, Indonesia, and only half of the sampled polyculture  plantations, while recording no sightings within the sampled disturbed  forest and monoculture plantations.<br/><br/><em>Hipposideros diadema </em>is an  insectivore, mostly feeding on Coleopterans, Lepidopterans, and  Orthopteras, however, it has also been classified as an “occasional  carnivore” that will occasionally feed on small birds and spiders (Pavey  and Burwell 1997). Samples of <em>H. diadema</em> stomach contents in Australia  consists of 78% Coleoptera and 20% Lepidoptera (Milne <em>et al.</em>2006).  In the Philippines, Galorio and Nuñeza (2014) found fruit bits in their  stomachs, suggesting they either consumed fruits or the insects  attracted to fruits, as bats can echolocate prey that are hidden on a  fruit surface (Korine and Kalko 2005). They also found bird feathers and  unidentified hair fibers within the stomachs, supporting the theory of  occasional carnivory. The species is a perch hunting species, with  continuous flight as a secondary behavior (Pavey 1998). It hangs from a  perch and scans the area using echolocation until it detects its prey  and then makes a fast, direct flight to catch it (Francis 2019). It  typically has 1-3 foraging areas with an average foraging range of  1.08km from the day roost (Pavey 1998) but can range up to 10km  (Bonoccorso 1998). It also usually goes out for 1-2 foraging bouts per  night (Pavey 1998), selecting several perches over 1km<sup>2</sup> (Francis 2019).<br/><br/>It  has a single breeding season that coincides with warmer temperatures  and the maximum quantity of insects (Nowak 1999). The females congregate  and form maternity colonies during March and April (Nowak 1998, Francis  2019). In peninsular Thailand, females with young were found in  maternity roosts in April (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the southern  hemisphere, dependent young and subadult <em>H. diadema </em>were also observed  in caves from April through May (Bonoccorso 1998). The females give  birth to a single pup and may carry it until it becomes independent  enough to fly and feed alone or leave it within the roost when searching  for food. Within the Bismarck Archipelago, lactating females are known  to carry infants from June through October (Bonoccorso 1998). A young <em>H.  diadema </em>will reach sexual maturity after about one year (Nowak 1999).  It has an average life span of about four to seven years but can live up  to twelve years in captivity (Nowak 1999).&#160;</p>","<p>Human disturbance and habitat loss (e.g., cave roosts and forest  foraging habitats) are the leading threats to <em>H. diadema </em>populations.  Caves are the preferred roost site for <em>H. diadema</em> and are highly  vulnerable to threats compared to any land resource (Galorio and Nuñeza  2014). Such threats include limestone extraction, tourism, guano  extraction, and cave swiftlet nests (Galorio and Nuñeza 2014, Kingston  2010). Destruction/disturbance of mines has also been shown to  significantly threaten cave-roosting species such as <em>H. diadema</em> (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Within Southeast Asia, as much of 74% of forest may be lost by the year 2100 (Sodhi <em>et al.</em>  2004). Singapore has lost 95% of its primary forest since the 1800s  with an estimated bat species loss of about 70% (Corlett 1992, Lane <em>et al.</em>  2006). Similarly, the rate of deforestation in Southeast Sulawesi was  41,814 ha/year in 1985–1997 (Kuhutanan 2002). Throughout all of  Indonesia, the Global Forest Watch reports 27Mha of tree cover loss  between 2001-2019 including more than 9.5Mha of humid primary forest,  further limiting bat species to protected areas (2021). <em>Hipposideros  diadema</em> remains flexible in its utilized foraging habitats, including  within highly disturbed areas (Francis 2019). However, the species is  still less likely to be found in disturbed habitats and monoculture  plantations (Huang <em>et al.</em> 2014) as it is not suited for  simplified vegetation, and the expansion of coffee agriculture and other  plantations have been shown to significantly reduce both bat abundance  and richness (Huang <em>et al.</em> 2019). The increase of such activity  will also likely further increase the disturbance of nearby caves, which  remains the leading threat to <em>H. diadema</em> populations. Furthermore,  simultaneous or continuous stressors, such as habitat loss and human  disturbance, can increase vulnerability to pathogens and parasites  (Phelps and Kingston 2018). Transmission of parasites through  consumption of scavenger insects has also been observed within <em>H.  diadema</em> and could post a risk to other population members (Galorio and  Nuñeza 2014).</p>","<p>Data are limited on the species population size and trend. There is a  presumed large population size that is suspected to be experiencing a  low-level population decline due to significant habitat loss and cave  disturbance. It can be locally common on the Nicobar Islands where  colonies of up to 500 bats have been documented (Aul and Vijaykumar  2003, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). Furthermore, maternity colonies (females  and young) of ca 8,000<em> H. diadema</em> have been observed in Papua New Guinea  (Bonoccorso 1998).<br/><br/>There are 15 subspecies recognized, four of  which are found in Papua New Guinea (Bonaccorso 1998). The subspecies  <em>H. d. masoni</em> on the Andaman Islands which differs from the subspecies  <em>H. d. nicobarensis </em>that is endemic to the Nicobar Islands (Srinivasulu <em>et al.</em>  2016). Additional research is needed to clarify the taxonomic  relationships among the the subspecies and evaluate if any may warrant  elevation to species-level.</p>",Decreasing,"The species is widespread and ranges from the Andaman and Nicobar  Islands of India of South Asia throughout Southeast Asia and south to  northeastern Australia (Srinivasulu <em>et al.</em> 2016, Aul <em>et al.</em>  2014).

It is found from sea level to 1,300 m asl.","Evidence of hunting of <em>H. diadema </em>include anecdotal reports from Southeast Asia. Since <em>H. diadema</em> is found in many places where bat hunting is common (Aul <em>et al</em>. 2014, Huang <em>et al. </em>2014, Wiantoro <em>et at</em>. 2016), the species is likely being locally hunted, but there is not enough data to support that it is a major threat to its population.",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Hipposideros diadema</em> is known from protected areas throughout its range  and there are currently no known species-specific conservation  initiatives in place for the species as it is a Least Concerned species.  For example, it has been recorded within and around Bukit Barisan  Selatan National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia, which is the second most  species rich area in Southeast Asia (Huang <em>et al.</em> 2014).  Furthermore, the species was also recorded in areas outside the  protection of the national park, including local villages, highlighting  the importance of protecting this broader diversity hotspot.<br/><br/>Further  surveys to identify and protect cave roosts that support the highest  populations (Kingston 2010) are needed. Therefore, future management  recommendations can focus on effectively providing protection for  species as well as maintaining any scientific, cultural, or economic  values of caves. Protection of more complex caves would provide more  available roost sites for<em> H. diadema</em>, reducing both competition and risk  of parasite transmission among individuals. Caves utilized by large  maternity colonies should also be identified and protected, as the  disturbance of these sites would likely cause local population declines  or extirpations.<br/><br/>Research on the current population status and  trends of <em>H. diadema</em> is lacking, yet crucial in creating effective  conservation actions for the species. Similarly, further research on the  ecology of maternity roosts would provide more information regarding  the impacts of cave disturbance on their population. Huang <em>et al.</em>  states that species differ in vulnerability to anthropogenic land use  changes (2019), therefore, further species-specific studies must be  performed to better analyze species sensitivity and form effective  conservation plans. This is especially critical for <em>H. diadema</em> as it is  found near many growing plantations/monocultures (Huang 2019, Huang  2014). Lastly, the extent of hunting of <em>H. diadema</em> is unknown and should  be quantified to determine its exact impact on their population.

Along the  coast, it roosts colonially in coral reef caves in remnant coastal  forests but likely to forage in adjacent scrublands and plantations  (McWilliam and Happold 2013). The species usually roosts adjacent to or  together with <em>Coleura afra</em>,&#160;<em>Miniopterus minor</em>, <em>Rousettus aegyptiacus</em>,  <em>Triaenops afer</em>, <em>Macronycteris gigas</em>, <em>M. vittata</em>, <em>Hipposideros caffer</em> and <em> Cloeotis percivali</em> (McWilliam and Happold 2013, Makori 2015, Musila <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><em><br/>Taphozous  hildegardeae </em>is insectivorous, feeding on Orthoptera and Lepidoptera  and seasonal variation in insect prey has been observed (McWilliam and  Happold 2013). Copulation and ovulation occur when rainfall is lowest  (late July to early August), and females give birth during the second wet-season  (mid- to late-December). There have been reports of pronounced delay in  giving birth, with some females still pregnant in late January or early  February, following a severe dry season when body condition in females  likely to be very poor and linked to delayed implantation (McWilliam and  Happold 2013).","This species is endemic to Kenya and Tanzania, with a small geographic range. Disturbance, including tourism and recreational activities of the coral caves on which it depends, and loss of forest habitat along the coastal strip, could result in population declines. Because the roost sites in coral caves are on unprotected community lands, at least in Kenya, this in itself is a threat because the future of these caves is uncertain. The land on which these caves are located are at risk of being converted to farmlands and the caves being closed off or destroyed.","The overall global population is thought to be declining due to cave  roost and forest degradation and loss. Large colonies roosting at  Makuruhu and Kaboga Caves near Watamu town in Kilifi County has been  estimated to include over 21,240 and 3,800 individuals, respectively  (Makori 2015, Musila <em>et al.</em>, 2019, P. Webala, unpublished data).  Another coral cave, called Kuruwitu, just a few kilometres north of  Mombasa has about 2,000 individuals (P. Webala, unpublished data). The  Fikirini/Mdenyenye Caves in Kwale County, south coast of Kenya are  estimated to have over 20,000 (P. Webala, unpublished data). A few  individuals in the hundreds are also resident at the historical Shimoni  Slave Cave on Kenya’s south coast.<br/><br/>Therefore, Kenyan populations at  northern and southern coastal Kenya are probably stable at the moment.  However, as these caves are unprotected on private and community lands  they are at great risk of development and loss. Two large populations in  coastal Kenya were estimated at about 1,000 to 2,000 individuals  (McWilliam and Happold 2013). During a survey in Kenya and Tanzania in  1988, population estimates from three caves surveyed yielded more than  1,500 individuals (1,000+, 300+, 130+) (Susan M. Pont, personal  observation).",Decreasing,"Hildegarde's Tomb Bat is endemic to Kenya and Tanzania, occurring in the coastal zone of Kenya and north-east Tanzania (from Malindi south to Dar es Salaam), as well as on Zanzibar Island (Kityo <em>et al</em>. 2009). It has been recorded from more than 15 coastal localities. Recently, the species was documented in the hundreds to thousands in a number of coral caves in Kilifi County, northern coastal Kenya (e.g., Kaboga, Kuruwitu Makururu Caves, Makori 2015, Musila <em>et al</em>. 2019, P Webala, unpublished data). It is present at suitable sites throughout the year, with some local movement (McWilliam and Happold 2013). However, a population of migrating individuals has been observed inhabiting a coastal cave in Kenya, appearing in November and disappearing in May (McWilliam and Happold 2013).<br/><br/>There are two central Kenya records collected by Harrison (1962) that have been questioned (Kock (1974), since these are the only localities not along the East African coast.

Several caves in central Mexico were known to contain considerable numbers in the past but now contain only small colonies or none at all, a similar situation occurs at the major colony in Texas (USFWS 2000).&#160;Major threats include disturbance of roosts (individuals often quickly take flight upon human entry, Wilson 1985), loss of food sources through clearing of land for agriculture and human exploitation of agaves. All these threats have proved to be significant factors in its decline. A population reduction is&#160;suspected to have been greater than 50% over the past three generations (15-18 years, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) as a direct result of local extinctions and habitat loss. More data and population monitoring are required for this species, and a reassessment is recommended as soon as additional information becomes available.","Habitats include desert scrub, open conifer-oak woodlands and pine forests in the Upper Sonoran and Transition Life Zones, generally arid areas where agave plants are present (USFWS 2000).&#160;This species usually favours higher and cooler regions than <em>L. yerbabuenae</em> (Arita 1991).&#160;Roosting habitat requirements are not well known.&#160;It usually roosts in large groups (up to 10,000) in caves or mines, occasionally found in buildings, hollow trees or culverts. It emerges well after sunset and feeds on pollen and nectar, principally of agaves and various cacti. <em>Pseudobombax, Ceiba, Ipomoea, Calliandra, Pinus</em>, and grasses are also important food sources in Central Mexico (Gardner 1977). Fruit and insects are sometimes taken; 173 samples contained insect parts in central México (Sánchez and Medellín 2007). Northern subpopulations migrate south in winter; numbers found in caves fluctuate greatly from year to year, indicating eruptive movements in addition to seasonal migration. A single young is born in May or June (Hensley and Wilkins 1988, Reid 1997).","Primary threats include disturbance of roosts, loss of food sources through clearing of land for agriculture and human exploitation of agaves (e.g., for production of alcoholic beverages), and direct killing by humans. Other threats may include negative effects of ingestion of pesticides applied to plants, competition for roosts and nectar, natural catastrophes, disease and predation; however, these are not believed to be major limiting factors, though some of them could become significant for subpopulations reduced to small size by other factors (see USFWS 2000). <br/><br/>These bats are sensitive to disturbance in their roosting sites (they often quickly take flight upon human entry; Wilson 1985) and, in general, roosting caves are becoming increasingly subject to human destruction and disturbance. Human disturbance and destruction of roost sites is a common occurrence in Mexico. The availability of roost sites free from disturbance may be a significant limiting factor. Special precautions should be taken when mine and cave surveys are conducted. In June and July when the young are very small, disturbance can cause them to lose their grasp on the rock and fall to their death. During hibernation, disturbance will cause an increase in metabolism; this use of fat reserves may cause starvation prior to spring (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 1996). A major problem for bats all over Mexico is that uninformed citizens frequently destroy all bats in a roost, believing them to be vampire bats. <br/><br/>Foraging habitat can be degraded or destroyed by harvesting of agave (an important food resource). Although it has been estimated that bootleg mescal makers are eliminating between 500,00 and 1,200,000 wild paniculate agave a year in Sonora alone, there is no clear support for such a statement. Agave plant parts are harvested just before they bloom; this prevents flowering and can prevent reproduction by the affected plant (an agave plant grows for 10 to 20 years, flowers only once, then dies). However, there are few places in Sonora or elsewhere in Mexico where wild Agave harvesting has eliminated a significant percentage of nectar-producing genets, and plants harvested by indigenous people generally produce vegetative offshoots that may eventually produce flowers (Nabhan and Fleming 1993). Populations of unharvested plants persist in many areas that are not easily accessible to humans. The negative impact of agave harvest probably is not as great as was previously believed. On the other hand, reduced pollination resulting from decreased bat populations may eventually lead to a reduction in agave distribution and abundance. <br/><br/>Some foraging habitat has been degraded or destroyed by expansion of agriculture and other land uses. Large areas of both the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental and the Mexican Plateau have been converted to agriculture or rangeland. <br/><br/>This species may experience predation from owls, hawks, snakes and mammals, but natural levels of predation likely are inconsequential to the overall status of the species. However, increased populations of domestic and feral cats and other predators near human habitations may affect the survival of colonies, particularly maternity colonies (USFWS 2000).","This bat is uncommon or rare (Reid 1997). The number of occurrences or subpopulations is unknown but probably exceeds 20; Arita (1991) mapped a few dozen collection sites in Mexico. One known colonial roosting site exists in the United States, which has shown large declines in the past (Matthews and Moseley 1990), but there could be one or more additional sites that have not yet been detected. The number of occurrences or subpopulations with good viability is unknown but likely there are not very many. Several caves in central Mexico were known to contain considerable numbers in the past but now contain only small colonies or none at all (see USFWS 2000). It is probably declining in number of occurrences or subpopulations and  in overall population size, but the rate of decline is unknown and  better information is need. The only mating roost has been declining but  is now protected.<br/><br/>There is a single known U.S. roost at  Emory Peak (a cave in Big Bend National Park,&#160;Texas), which&#160;fluctuates widely from year to year (zero to 10,000+ individuals): 10,650 bats in 1967, 5,000 in 1968, 3,900  in 1969, zero in 1970, 8,025 in 1971, 1,000 in 1983, 4,942-5,990 in  1988, over 5,000 in 1991, zero in 1992, and 2,859 in 1993 (Matthews and  Moseley 1990, see USFWS 2000). No significant trend can be ascertained from these data,  which are the best available for the species. Reasons for the  fluctuations are not understood, but they could reflect annual  variations in food resources in different parts of the range (USFWS  2000).&#160;Fluctuation may be in part due to some counts being made before  or after the main period of bat occupation of the cave (Cockrum and  Petryszyn 1991). The Texas subpopulation may be a ""spill-over"" colony  present during years of high population or reduced food supply. <br/><br/>Sánchez and Medellín (2007) estimated the  colony at Cueva del Diablo, Morelos, central Mexico, at 3,000  individuals, while López (2010) estimated the same colony at 4,000. Both  estimates were done visually under the supervision of the same  individual (R. Medellin) and during the winter months, the only time of  the year this species remains in the area. Arita and Prado rated this  species as widespread and scarce in Mexico. See  Arita (1993) for general information on conservation status and  population size in Mexico. <br/><br/>The long-term trend  is unclear. The extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO)  probably have not changed much, but the habitat quality, the number of occurrences or  subpopulations and population size may have dramatically decreased in  some sites during the last three decades. Wilson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  (1985) found that this species was either completely absent or present  in reduced numbers in known roosts. The number of bats found represented  only a fraction of the total reported in previous studies. For example,  in an abandoned mine in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, where an estimated  population of 10,000 was observed in 1938, no individuals of <em>L. nivalis</em>  were found in 1983 (Wilson 1985). Another mine in Nuevo Leon had a  ceiling covered with newborn bats in 1967, but only one bat was found in  1983. A few other roosts had reduced numbers of bats compared to  findings during previous surveys. These changes could indicate a decline  in the overall population, but they might reflect movement of bats  among different roosting sites in different years, or they could result  from seasonal changes in bat distribution (survey dates varied).",Decreasing,"This species is known from southeast Arizona, south New Mexico and southwest Texas (USA) to south Mexico and Guatemala (Simmons 2005). However, there is no evidence of this species being present south of Guerrero, Mexico (R. Medellín unpubl. data), and its southern limit of distribution should be adjusted to central Guerrero, Mexico, to reflect this fact. It generally occurs from lowlands to 3,500 m asl (mostly 1,000 to 2,200 m asl, Reid 1997).<br/><br/>The range includes medium to high elevations in northern and central Mexico, southwestern Texas (southern Brewster and Presidio counties), and southwestern New Mexico, at elevations of about 500 to 3,500 m asl. Most occurrences in Mexico are at elevations of 1,000 to 2,200 m asl, but this bat been captured at an elevation of 3,780 m asl (Arita 1991), and the type specimen was caught near snow line at 17,816 feet (5,747 m asl) on Mt. Orizaba, in Veracruz, Mexico (USFWS 2000). In Texas, this species is known from the Big Bend National Park and Chinati Mountain area. Two specimens of <em>Leptonycteris </em>taken in Hidalgo County, New Mexico (in 1963 and 1967), were determined to be <em>L. nivalis</em>. The presence of this species in New Mexico was reconfirmed in Hidalgo County in 1992 (Hoyt <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994). This species formerly was thought to occupy a much larger area, extending into southern Mexico and Guatemala, but specimens collected from those areas have been assigned to <em>L. yerbabuenae</em> (Arita and Humphrey 1988). The only colonial roost in the U.S. is a cave at Emory Peak, at an elevation of 2,290 m asl, in the Chisos Mountains, Texas. Simmons (2005) described the range of <em>L. nivalis</em> as extending to southern Mexico and Guatemala, and she also included southeastern Arizona in the range. However, no actual records for Arizona are known, and Arita (1991) showed the range as extending only as far south as Puebla and northern Guerrero.",This species is not used.,Terrestrial,"A protected subpopulation exists at Emory Peak, Big Bend National Park, Texas (USFWS 2000). Further regular surveys are needed to determine important roost sites, abundance and trends. Conservation of this bat will require maintenance of relatively large areas of wild Agave. Identification and protection of currently and formerly occupied roost sites and protection of foraging habitat in at least several areas throughout the range are important conservation needs. Subpopulations need to be defined, and movement patterns need to be better understood. Accurate censusing methods need to be developed. This species is the focus of a specific conservation program by the government and the University of Mexico (UNAM). The only mating roost known in the state of Morelos, central Mexico is now secured as a sanctuary and&#160;with the aid&#160;of the local land owners the situation is improving dramatically.&#160;In Mexico the species is listed as threatened under NOM - 059 - SEMARNAT - 2015, and is a priority species of the Mexican Bat Conservation Program and of the Commission of Protected Areas of the Mexican Federal Government.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22128326,7787,Eonycteris spelaea,Least Concern,,2020,2020-07-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Eonycteris spelaea is l</em>isted as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, it occurs in a number of protected areas, has a tolerance of a degree of habitat modification, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.","<p>This is a nectarivorous cave roosting species that forms compact  clusters forming large colonies consisting of hundreds to tens of  thousands of individuals. It can also form small colonies or join  colonies of different species (e.g., <em>Rousettus amplexicaudatus</em>). Its  preferred shelter are caves in forested habitat, but can be found in a  variety of habitats and have been observed utilizing man-made structures  such as: mines (Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em> 1992, Furey <em>et al.</em>  2011), the attics of village huts (Tarapada Bhattacharyya pers. comm.  June 2005, Khim Maung Swe pers. comm. January 2000), the basement of a  high-rise building (Lim 2015), and beneath a high vehicular bridge. A  study in Mindanao, Philippines observed use of caves located near water  that have large openings and multiple entry points (Tanalgo and Tabora  2015). Within the cave, this species prefers to cling to walls in areas  of partial illumination (Tanalgo and Tabora 2015). In addition, it is  known to roost high in the ceilings of caves in Thailand (Acharya Pers.  obs. 2019).<br/><br/>The species has high aspect ratio wings and high wing  loading capacity, making it a strong flyer capable of long-distance  flight (Chakravarty <em>et al.</em> 2018). Individuals fly many kilometers  in search of food each night and the longest foraging distance is from  Malaysia was inferred to be ca 38 km based on finding of mangrove pollen  at a land locked roost site (Start and Marshall 1974). Since then,  radio telemetry has provided more insight to nightly foraging distances.  The longest observed distance from study out of southern Thailand was  17.9 km, only half of the historical estimate (Acharya <em>et al.</em>  2015a). Nightly foraging distance has been found to correlate with roost  size, the larger the roost, the longer the foraging distance. A study  conducted in southern Thailand exemplifies this as bats from the largest  roost were recorded traveling farther than those in smaller roosts  (Acharya <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Although day roosting in large colonies  may be beneficial, these colonies create increased competition for  resources, hence the need to forage farther from the roost site (Fleming  1982, Wilkinson 1992).<br/><br/><em>Eonycteris spelaea </em>is known to forage in  agricultural areas, primary forest, secondary forest, and coastal  mangroves (Smith and Xie 2008, Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017). It forages individually or in small groups by landing on a flower for 2-3 seconds at a time (Acharya <em>et al.</em>  2015b). It is a generalist, taking advantage of any available food  sources (Stewart and Dudash 2018), and is the most common pollinator of  many chiropterophilous plant species in Southeast Asia (Gould 1978; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009; Sritongchuay <em>et al.</em> 2008; Stewart and Dudash 2016; Acharya 2015a,b). Its diet varies across its distribution: it has been found to feed on 55 plant species in Malaysia (Lim <em>et al.</em> 2018), 19 plant species in Thailand (Pakarnseree 1986), 13 plant species in Cambodia (Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017), and 18 plant species in China (Yunnan Province and Jinjhong City, Yang <em>et al.</em>  2017). Across its range. E. spelaea provides significant ecological  services as it pollinates coastal mangroves, primary forests, and many  economically important crops including durian (Durio zibethinus), tree  bean (Parkia timoriana) and petai (<em>P. speciosa</em>, Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sritongchuay et al 2008, Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nor Zalipah <em>et al.</em> 2016, Stewart and Dudash 2016, Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Reproduction occurs year-round and is often observed correlating with blooms of certain food sources (Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2013, Heideman and Utzurrum 2003). Females produce one offspring (with which they can fly) per year (Bates and Harrison 1997).<br/><br/>It  is not known to migrate seasonally as it is a generalist and switches  food sources throughout the year. However, this may vary with location  as in Xishuangbanna, China, about 1,000 individuals were found roosting  in a cave with about 600 <em>Rousettus leschenaulti</em> in the winter with both  species vacating the cave during the reproductive period, which  corresponded to when the cave was occupied by <em>Chaerephon plicata</em> (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>There  is evidence of significant sexual dimorphism in this species with the  males (55.0-82.0 g) being larger than females (35.0-78.0 g, Rahman and  Chaudhury 2017). It exhibits physical adaptations for nectar feeding  including a long muzzle and sharply pointed tongue, with well-developed  filiform papillae at the tip (Bumrungsri et al 2013). Their ears are  simple and they do not have a tragus. The dorsal pelage is brown and the  ventral is pale in color, males have longer and darker fur around the  neck than females (Rahman and Chaudhurry 2017). The species two  distinguishing features including large, kidney shaped glands on either  side of the anus (Nameer <em>et al.</em> 2016) and has no claw on its second digit (Atmoko and Nugroho 2013).</p>","Throughout its range, this species is threatened by at least one of the  following: habitat loss, cave disturbance, bushmeat hunting, quarrying,  lack of legal protection or enforcement of existing protection, and  persecution from a lack of education among locals.<br/><br/><strong>Habitat Loss</strong>:  This species is pressured by the loss of both roosting and foraging  habitat, both of which are impacted by human development (Achondo <em>et al.</em> 2014; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013; Fukuda <em>et al.</em> 2009; Furey 2011; Kingston 2010; Lim 2015; Maryanto and Irawati 2015; Phelps 2016; Rahman <em>et al.</em> 2018; Tanalgo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016; Tanalgo and Tabora 2015; Zhang <em>et al.</em>  2010). For example, between 1990 and 2010, Peninsular Malaysia lost  8.6% (or 1,920,000 hectares) of its forest cover (Lim 2015).  Additionally, quarrying is resulting in the isolation and loss of  limestone karst features (Acharya 2015b; Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008; Fukuda 2009; Kingston 2010; Phelps <em>et al.</em> 2016; Zhang 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Cave  Disturbance</strong>: Cave disturbance is common and widespread, often causing  significant population declines. Documented sources of cave disturbance  include guano mining, limestone quarrying, opportunistic recreation,  tourism, and religious practices (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2002; Heideman and Utzurrum 2003; Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008; Fukuda 2009; Zhang 2010; Kingston 2010; Furey 2011; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2013; Mould 2012; Acharya 2015bandc; Tanalgo and Tabora 2015; Phelps <em>et al.</em> 2016; Roslan <em>et al.</em> 2016; Tanalgo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016; Rahman and Chaudhury 2017; Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017; Yang <em>et al.</em> 2017; Rahman <em>et al.</em>  2018). Cave disturbance, if the cave itself is not destroyed, has been  correlated to population declines in monitored locations. For example,  Khao Kao Cave in southern Thailand was reported to have 20,000  individuals in 2003 but declined to 500 by 2008 due to human mining of  surface soil; once disturbance subsided, the population returned to the  thousands but has yet to recover its original size (S. Bumrungsri Pers  comm 2019). In Malaysia, Batu Caves has also seen population declines as  it is a popular Hindu shrine (Start and Marshall 1976; Beck and Lim  1972; Gould 1988). “Threats to the species also appear to worsen around  April (the Khmer new-year) each year and awareness of the pollination  services it provides is non-existent among the public, including durian  farmers” (Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Hunting and Trapping</strong>: It is  hunted for bushmeat in many countries as well as being killed by  farmers who believe they are harming their crops (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2002; Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008; Smith and Xie 2008; Sritongchuay <em>et al.</em> 2008; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013; Furey 2011; Fukuda 2009; Kingston 2010; Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010; Maryanto <em>et al.</em> 2011; Mould 2012; Rahman and Chaudhruy 2017; Tanalgo <em>et al.</em>  2014, 2016; Acharya 2015bc; Tanalgo and Tabora 2015; Rahman <em>et al.</em>&#160; 2018). Their affinity to roost in huge colonies, near the openings of  caves, and in caves with many entrances makes them easy to hunt (Tanalgo  and Tabora 2015). Hunters use a variety of techniques to hunt the bats,  some as simple as netting a cave entrance while others involve flushing  the colony using fire and other disruptive behaviors. It is persecuted  by farmers due to the misconception that the bats damage crops when to  the contrary they are beneficial pollinators. Bat killings by farmers in  their mixed fruit orchards through netting is a major threat to some  cave colonies in Southern Thailand (Acharya Pers. Obs 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Lack  of Protection</strong>: There is a lack of legal protection or enforcement of  existing protection as well as unjustified persecution (stemming from a  lack of education) among locals. Lack of education among local people  results in the unnecessary killing of this species. It is a widespread  misconception that this species is a pest, often believed to harm crops.  In South Asia, including China (Zhang 2010), it is considered vermin  under Schedule V of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act.<p></p>","<em>Eonycteris spelaea</em> is a widespread species that is commonly encountered.  Its global population is declining due to extensive disturbance in its  roosts from hunting, mining, and numerous other threats; a lack of  consistent monitoring makes accurate population estimates difficult.<br/>It  is a colonial roosting species that can congregate in large colonies,  few of which are known relative to its large distribution. On Palawan  Island, Philippines, a colony that probably exceeded 50,000 individuals  was reported (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004); the current status is  unknown. The two largest colonies documented within the last decade are  in a cave with limited disturbance in Ban Na-San district of Surat Thani  Province, Thailand, with an estimated 30,000 individuals (Acharya  2015a) and a cave in East Java with an estimated 40,000 individuals  (Bagus, 2010, unpublished data; Maharadatunkasmi <em>et al.</em> 2003).  More recently, Khao Kao Cave in southern Thailand was reported to have  20,000 individuals in 2003, but declined to ca. 500 individuals by 2008  due to human disturbance; the population has increased to a few thousand  following restrictions to in human activity in the caves (Bumrungsri,  unpublished data/pers. obs). The disturbed Batu caves of Malaysia were  reported to contain &gt;10,000 individuals (Start and Marshall 1976),  but more recent estimates state &gt;4,000 individuals (Beck and Lim  1972, Gould 1988). Otherwise, all colony population estimates reported  in the last decade contain ca 2,000 or fewer individuals . In Cambodia  the Bat Khteas cave is reported to contain 1,000-1,400 individuals  (Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>There are limited historical  accounts reporting large colonies and of these, very few populations  have been monitored over time; those that were monitored through time  show declines. Further, there are multiple informal reports of local  population declines in caves, either through primary observation or  current evidence indicating larger populations in the past.",Decreasing,"The range of<em> Eonycteris spelaea</em> includes nearly all of Southeast Asia,  southern China, and extends west through both northwestern and southern  South Asia.<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia it is known from: the Philippines,  Indonesia, East and West Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia,  Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar.<br/><br/>In the Philippines it is found throughout the country including from: Biliran, Bohol (Phelps <em>et al.</em>  2016), Camotes (Paguntalan pers. comm. 2006), Carabro (Alcala and  Alviola 1970), Catanduanes, Cebu, Danjugan (Carino 2004; O’Malley <em>et al.</em>  2006), Ilin (Gonzalez pers. comm. 2006); Leyte, Luzon Abra, Cavite,  Ilocos Norte, Laguna, Pampanga, Rizal, Sorsogon, Marinduque, Maripipi,  Masbate, Mindanao Agusan del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, Lanao  del Norte, Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental (Ramayla pers. comm.),  Cotabato (Achondo 2014), North Cotabato (Tanalgo <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016; Achondo <em>et al.</em>  2014), South Cotabato, Surigao del Norte, and Zamboanga del Sur  provinces), Mindanao (Tanalgo and Tabora 2015), Mindoro, Negros  (Heideman and Utzurrum 2003), Palawan (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004),  Polillo, Samar (Gonzalez pers. comm. 2006), Sanga-sanga, Sabtang,  Siargao, Sibuyan, Siquijor, Tablas, and Ticao (Paguntalan pers. comm.  2006; Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998).

It has been observed five times in Nepal from Kaski, Khotang, and Chitwan districts (Sharma <em>et al.</em>  2019).

However, there are few records, if any, of significant colonies (&gt;1,000 [Thavry <em>et al.</em>  2017]) of the species within protected areas. It is widely accepted  that, if not as a whole, subpopulations of this species are threatened  due to multiple anthropogenic pressures and as a principal bat  pollinator in Old World tropics, its conservation should be prioritized  (Acharya 2015). Its direct ecological role on plant pollination (Acharya  2015) and all related benefits (gene flow of plant species, maintenance  of landscape, local economy, etc) make this species a priority.<br/><br/>Direct  conservation measures across its area of occurrence are necessary to  prevent suspected and projected population declines. Main conservation  priorities include public education, protection of colonies and their  required resources, and the establishment of sustainable harvesting  practices. Sustained public education and increased awareness of the  commercial and ecological importance of pollinators are imperative to  the conservation and protection of this species on a local level  (Maharadatunkamsi 2003, Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thavry <em>et al.</em>  2017). Law enforcement efforts as well as effective management and  protection are needed to prevent unregulated human disturbances at cave  sites (Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009,2013; Furey <em>et al.</em> 2011; Tanalgo and Tabora 2015; Thavry <em>et al.</em>  2017). Additionally, the conservation and planting of chiropterophilous  plant populations would promote the health and site fidelity of this  species (Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2013; Acharya 2015b,c; Thavry <em>et al.</em>  2017). To safeguard both the bats and the people who rely on them,  sustainable harvesting practices, monitoring programs, and the  protection of limestone karst ecosystems are needed (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Furey <em>et al.</em> 2011).

The Pallid Bat is usually found in rocky, mountainous areas and near water. They are also found over more open, sparsely vegetated grasslands, and they seem to prefer to forage in the open. The Pallid Bat has three different roosts. The day roost is usually in a warm, horizontal opening such as in attics or rock cracks, the night roost is usually in the open, near foliage, and the hibernation roost, which is often in buildings, caves, or cracks in rocks (Miller 2002).The diet of this bat includes a significant proportion of beetles, grasshoppers, and moths, also it consumes scorpions and flightless arthropods such as crickets. Lizards have also been reported as prey items. Mating takes place in late autumn or early winter. Female Pallid Bats store sperm in the reproductive tract until ovulation takes place in the spring. Births generally occur in large maternity colonies in May and Junes. Males are generally absent from these maternity colonies. Yearling females have single offspring, whereas older females may have twins annually (Wilson and Ruff 1999).","The Pallid Bat may be in trouble because it is very sensitive to disturbance. Any disturbance, even hiking, can cause the bat to abandon a roosting area completely. Human disturbance of foraging areas has also decreased prey availability and diversity. Also, the use of pesticides has had a serious impact on Pallid Bat populations (Miller 2002).","It is locally common (Wilson and Ruff 1999).

They are the most abundant of North American bats that are found in deserts, but are found at higher elevations in arid brush lands, grasslands, and even some forests. Western Pipistrelles spend their days roosting in rock crevices, beneath rocks, in burrows, mines, and buildings (Wilson and Ruff 1999). It has been suggested that Western Pipistrelles use burrows made by kangaroo rats (<em>Dipodomys</em> spp.) and other rodents (Barbour and Davis 1969).<br/>This species spends winter hibernating in mines, caves, and rock crevices. Water is a very important resource determining the distribution of this bat. Because of the high proportion of protein in their diet, the arid environment that they inhabit, and the subsequent high levels of evaporate water loss, Western Pipistrelles generally roost close to a water source. Availability of maternity roost sites is an extremely important factor in successful bat reproduction (Cockrum and Cross 1964). However, this species is only modestly colonial, and solitary individuals are typical (Wilson and Ruff 1999).<br/>Western Pipistrelles begin their foraging flights very early in the evening hours, making them one of the most diurnal of North American bats. They may also be encountered later in the evening (4 hrs after sunset), or closer to the morning. Occasionally, individual bats have been observed on wing during mid-day, during which time they seek out water to alleviate stress caused by the arid environment they inhabit. Because these bats fly slowly, they are restricted to small foraging circuits; it is also nonmigratory. They have a very slow, fluttery flight that can often be observed along cliff faces, among pinyon trees, or other desert shrubs. They are often mistaken for large moths (Peters 2003).","Since reopening abandoned or inactive mines can negatively affect bat colonies, it has been recommended that multi-seasonal surveys be conducted prior to allowing any renewed mining. Human disturbance can be extremely detrimental to bat colonies, especially to non-volant young and hibernating adults, depending on the season and severity of the disturbance. Mines that are in close proximity to roads, towns, hiking trails or camp grounds are more susceptible to disturbance then those in remote areas with difficult access. There is a need for greater assurance that roosts will remain undisturbed and that future (potential) roost sites will be left when managing for bats in pinyon-juniper habitat. Ideally, management should aim to sustain adequate food, water, and roost sites in close proximity to one another (Klingel 2000).","These are abundant and most common at low elevations in desert scrub and arid grassland habitats. It is one of the most common bats seen over waterholes and streams in arid habitats. In 1890, C. Hart Merriam wrote that this species was found in swarms in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River (Arizona), an observation that attests to their abundance and prominence in canyon environments (Wilson and Ruff 1999).",Stable,"This species occurs from Washington to Southwestern Oklahoma (USA), and Baja California, south to Hidalgo and Guerrero (Mexico) (Simmons 2005).",,Terrestrial,Protection of this species requires to avoid habitat loss and human disturbance.

Historic colonies  have been lost throughout its range and ongoing decline occurs in its extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), and habitat extent and quality, especially the loss of  cave roosts. Further, introduced species directly and indirectly impact  roosts and foraging areas.<br/><u><br/></u>The <em style="""">E. s. semicaudata </em>subspecies has  suffered dramatic losses throughout its range. The subspecies appears to  have suffered local extinctions in Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, and  Vanuatu. Fiji appears to be its last bastion and even there, most of the  large historic colonies have been lost and the subspecies is feared to  have been extirpated from many islands where it was previously found.  The current status of the species is not well understood as there have  been no recent assessments.&#160;Similar to <em style="""">E. s. semicaudata</em>, the <em style="""">E. s.  rotensis</em> subspecies has experienced dramatic losses throughout its  distribution on Guam and throughout the Marianna Islands, and it is  currently only known from Aguiguan Island. The status of <em style="""">E. s.  palauensis</em> and <em style="""">E. s. sulcata</em> is uncertain as there have been no recent  assessments. There is little reason to believe these two subspecies are  faring better than their counterparts.","<em><em>Emballonura </em>semicaudata</em> is a small (five gram) cave-obligate bat that roosts in a  range of cave types, including limestone caves, lava tubes,  shelter-caves on overhanging cliffs, and rock crevices (Flannery 1995;  Watling and Pernetta 1978; Grant <em>et al.</em> 1994; Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001; Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2007; Wiles <em>et al.</em>  2011). Relatively large colonies appear common in the Palau subspecies  while smaller colonies may be more representative of the other  subspecies (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wiles and Worthington 2002). Basic  information on roost microclimate and habitat preferences are lacking  for all subspecies (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001). It is important to note  that subspecies that have undergone dramatic declines may be persisting  in caves in sub-optimal conditions, after exclusion from their  historical roosts. Pacific sheath-tailed bats are commonly found sharing  caves with swiftlets (<em>Aerodramus </em>spp.) across their range (Watling and Pernetta 1978, Lemke 1986, Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001, Tarburton 2002, Wiles and Worthington 2002, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>Although  the species has occasionally been recorded flying in daylight under  forest canopy it normally emerges at dusk to forage. While details of  its diet are limited (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001), <em>E. s. rotensis</em> have been documented to primarily forage on Hymenopterans and Lepidopterans (Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>The  four subspecies are thought to prefer to forage in well-structured  mature forest (native and non-native) with a high and dense canopy and  relatively near to their roosting caves (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Gorreson <em>et al.</em> 2009, Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011, Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Palau and Chuuk, the subspecies has occasionally been  observed foraging over town streets (Bruner and Pratt 1979). Recent work  has documented lower bat activity over introduced lantana shrub  habitats (Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Despite the long-term global population decline of <em>E. semicaudata </em> throughout much of its range, especially the <em>E. s. rotensis</em> and <em>E. s.  semicaudata</em> subspecies, there is no definitive explanation for the of  precipitous declines. Losses have been reported as far back as 1945. All  the subspecies are at high risk of extinction because they occur in  isolated oceanic island systems and are subject to stochastic events,  including the threat from more frequent and stronger major cyclones that  may defoliate forests, reduce the abundance of insect prey or even  cause the direct loss of roosts when storms flood caves or landslides  close cave entrances, exacerbating other threats (Grant <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994).<br/>Significant  threats include the disturbance of roosting sites from local uses,  vandalism and ecotourism, the loss and degradation of native forests  from timber harvesting and conversion to agricultural lands, mining and  quarrying adjacent to cave roosts and guano mining within roosts,  invasive species (plants and animals (e.g., goats), fire in proximity to  roosts (Grant <em>et al.</em> 1994; Wiles <em>et al</em>. 1997; Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2007; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011; Scanlon <em>et al.</em> 2014; Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Further, loss of genetic variation has been recorded for <em>E. s. rotensis </em>(Oyler-McCance <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2013). Recent genetic analysis also supports the separation and  elevation of at least three of the subspecies to full species status.  Specifically, Oyler-McCance <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2013) report that  their “data fully support the separation of these 3 subspecies for  conservation and management purposes”, the fourth subspecies was not  included in their analysis and needs genetic appraisal as well. Although  genetic differentiation exists, the species are yet to be described.  Meanwhile, the subspecies status limits their elevation in conservation  status to Critically Endangered (primarily because the four subspecies  together occur across a vast area), which also impacts the opportunities  for host countries to promote their conservation (Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Loss of genetic diversity is a key threat to all subspecies given their increasing isolation and low population levels.<br/><br/>Grant <em><em>et al.</em></em>  (1994) concluded that pesticide contamination was unlikely to be  implicated in the significant decline of <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> in America  Samoa because co-roosting swiftlets did not experience similar losses.  However, it is important to note that bats and swiftlets have different  ecological niches and therefore may be differentially exposed to and/or  susceptible to pesticides. In the Mariana Islands for example, <em>E. s.  rotensis</em> primarily consumed nocturnal Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and  Hymenoptera, while the swiftlet (Aerodramus bartschi) preferred  Hymenopteran prey (Valdez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Even within  Hymenoptera, bats primarily fed on Ichneumoideans whereas swiftlets ate  more formicidalates and chalicidoideans (Valdez <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2011). It is unclear if or how pesticides have impacted the Pacific  sheath-tailed bat through bioaccumulation and biomagnification for  example. It is premature to dismiss pesticide contamination as a threat  to <em>E. semicaudata</em> until explicit research has been completed in this  area.","<em>Emballonura semicaudata </em>likely represented a large metapopulation where  each species was previously relatively common over much of their  respective ranges and there was some level of genetic connectedness due  to infrequent movements and successful breeding. Unfortunately, due to  the dramatic declines of the <em>E. s. rotensis </em>and <em>E. s. semicaudata </em> subspecies, the metapopulation structure appears to have broken down as  subpopulations have been and are continuing to be extirpated. While  there still may be subspecies-level metapopulations for <em>E. s. sulcata </em> and <em>E. s. palauensis</em>, that of <em>E. s. rotensis</em> appears to be lost as only  one subpopulation remains and the <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> subpopulation is  greatly reduced due to likely extirpation from several countries.<br/><br/><em><em>Emballonura </em>s. rotensis</em> was last observed on Guam in 1972 and was thought to have  been extirpated from the Northern Mariana Islands after 1932 until the  discovery of a small population on Aguiguan Island (approximately 7 km²  in size) in 1984 (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). In 2008, there were an estimated 359-466 bats in total using 3 caves; over 70% of the bats used a single cave (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). As late as 2013, the subspecies was still known from the three caves (Welch <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). A recent, but limited survey effort at those three caves  confirmed the continued use of two of the caves, one with an estimated  308-382 bats (Liske-Clark <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>The decline of  <em>E. s. semicaudata</em>, while not as extensive as that documented for<em> E. s.  rotensis</em>, is just as alarming as the subspecies appears to have been  extirpated from Tonga, Samoa, America Samoa, and Vanuatu (Helgen and  Flannery 2002, Uyehara and Wiles 2009, Tarburton 2011, M. Pennay pers.  comm. in Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Fiji is the last stronghold  for <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> and its populations are estimated to have  declined by &gt;80% (Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014); the subspecies  is feared to have been extirpated from Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and the  Yasawa archipelago (Flannery 1995; Palmierim <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, 2007; Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2014). A new roost found on Taveuni in 2018 with a reported 2,000 bats  appeared to have only a couple of hundred bats in 2019, perhaps due to  the conversion of forest habitat to agriculture lands  (NatureFiji-MareqetiViti, unpublished data). The loss of historic  colonies continues and in 2018, the subspecies was not detected on  Rotuma and experts have proposed it has been extirpated from the island  (Cibois <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press).<br/><br/>The<em> E. s. sulcata</em> and <em>E. s. palauensis</em> subspecies were thought to be relatively stable in the 1990s (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Hutson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001) and were reported to be doing relatively well within portions of their range as late as 2005 (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em>  1997, G. Wiles pers. comm. 2019). Unfortunately, their current status  are unknown as there have been no recent surveys. Given the dramatic  decline of the <em>E. s. rotensis</em> and <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> subspecies  throughout their range, a precautionary view should be taken on their  status until reliable data are obtained.",Decreasing,"<em>Emballonura semicaudata</em> is the only species of Emballonura found in the  Pacific outside of the Solomon Island chain (Koopman 1993, 1997; Helgen  and Flannery 2002). Currently, there are four recognized subspecies,  including: <em><br/></em><ul><li><em>E. s. semicaudata</em> has a historical distribution that includes Samoa, American Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, and Vanuatu. In Samoa, it  was historically found on Savai'i and Upolu islands, where it was  relatively common and in American Samoa, it was found on Manua and  Tutuila islands. This species is now recognized as Critically Endangered  in American Samoa and Samoa (Hutson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, Tarburton 2002), and has not been recorded in American Samoa since 2006 (Fraser <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2009). In Tonga, the subspecies was found on Eua and Niuafoou islands  and was last collected in 1989. It has not been recorded in more recent  surveys (Rinke 1991; M. Pennay, personal communications, 2007 in Scanlon  <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The species was collected from  Espiritu Santo Island, Vanuatu in 1929 and appears to have been  extirpated as more recent surveys have failed to detect the species  (Helgen and Flannery 2002). In Fiji, <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> was historically  found on Fiji’s three largest islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and  Taveuni. It was also known from the Yasawa archipelago, the Lau Group,  and Rotuma Island (Ingleby and Flannery 1991; Flannery 1995; Palmeirim <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2005, 2007; Scanlon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Unfortunately, the subspecies has  declined dramatically across its range in Fiji and now appears to be  restricted to Taveuni, the Natewa Peninsula of Vanua Levu, and a few  small islands of the Lau Group (Ingleby and Flannery 1991, Flannery  1995, Palmeirim <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, 2007, Macedru 2010, Scanlon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014); recent surveys suggest it has been extirpated from Rotuma (Cibois <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press).

Furthermore, the increase of young conifer plantations, occurring from 1950s to 1970s, provided indirectly a large quantity of food for the serow and could have determined population growth. The serow is currently not at risk of extinction as a species, but some local populations in western Japan are vulnerable because of potential interspecific competition with sika deer and the decrease of forest understory.&#160;</p>  <p>In 1990s, damage by serow declined with the decrease of young plantations.

In a subsequent survey report of the Environment Agency in 1984, the distribution area and population size of serow were estimated at 39,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and 100,000 individuals, respectively. These estimates of distribution areas and population sizes for serow should be considered underestimates for the following reasons:</p><p><ol><li>In the calculation of the distribution area, sample areas did not cover the whole range inhabited by serows.

In 1934, this species was designated to be a ‘Natural Monument Species’ under the Law for Protection of Cultural Properties (LPCP). In 1955, its status was raised to ‘Special Natural Monument Species’. Although serow hunting has been prohibited by laws since 1925, poaching pressure was high before the 1950s. An anti-poaching campaign was conducted throughout the country in 1959, and, after eliminating poaching, the serow population began to increase. The population increase was probably also due to an increase of suitable habitat in the form of young coniferous plantations created from mid 1950s to 1970s. However, damage to young artificial plantations and crops also drastically increased with the serow increase. Nevertheless, any capture of serows including damage control, was not permitted until 1978, with the exception of scientific research. The management measures of this species became a matter of controversy between conservationists, forest owners and/or farmers. Then the government agencies permitted to capture serows by using tranquilizer guns in 1978,&#160; but many of the captured serows died during the darting operations.<br/> <br/> The Japanese serow is managed under two laws: LPCP, and the Wildlife Protection and Hunting Law (WPHL) which was enacted in 1963 by the revision of the Hunting Act. The executive authority of LPCP is the Agency for Cultural Affairs (AFCA), and that of WPHL is Ministry of Environment (MOE). The Forestry Agency (FA) has jurisdiction over forest management policy, which concerns damage prevention and forest use. The executing organization of the LPCP in each prefecture is Board of Education of the prefectural governments, and that of the WPHL is Wildlife Management Division, Section, or Unit of prefectural governments.&#160;</p>  <p>In 1979, these three Agencies reached an agreement to change serow management measures, as previous management measures could no longer solve the problems mentioned above. The essential points of the new management policy were as follows.<br/><ol><li>To establish serow protection areas. This decision meant the designation of ‘Special Natural Monument Species’ would be repealed and instead ‘Serow Protection Areas’ would be designated based on LPCP in the future.&#160;</li><li>To allow nuisance animal control outside the serow protection areas, in cases of necessity.</li><li>The AFCA takes administrative responsibility for preservation of serow in protected areas, the MOE for managing serow outside protected areas, and the FA for avoiding damage to young coniferous plantations by non-lethal methods such as fencing and netting.</li></ol></p>  <p>Conservation NGOs and the majority of ecologists opposed to this policy change. However, this policy change was inevitable from the viewpoints of the serow population trends and social conditions at that time.<br/> <br/> Three primary functions expected to the protection areas were (1) to maintain stable and viable local populations; (2) to preserve the geographical and genetic diversity of serow populations; and (3) to establish a management system for the serow and its habitat. Of the 15 protection areas planned, 13 had been established by 1989, but the remaining two protection areas have not yet been established in Kyushu and Shikoku due to disagreements with land owners. Therefore, the Japanese serow still retains the status of ‘Special Natural Monument Species’. The size of serow protection area ranges from 143km² to 2,180 km² with total area of 11,800 km², covering about 20% of the serow range in 1983 and spanning 23 prefectures. However, in many cases, the protection areas avoid commercial forests and are situated at relatively high elevation areas including unsuitable habitats. In addition, densities of serow in most protection areas declined significantly over the last 20 years. As a result, some protection areas have not been able to maintain the minimum viable population size within them. Further expansion of each protection area faces difficulty due to social conditions e.g. land ownership. Therefore, it is necessary to conserve serow populations by integrated management of protected areas and non-protected areas, through the cooperation of the AFCA and the MOE.</p>  <p>The AFCA initiated a systematic survey of serow management for protection areas in 1985, composed of main and supplemental survey programs. The purpose of the main survey program is to monitor population trends and habitat conditions every 6 to 8 years for each protection area. This program is carried out by survey specialists. Annual supplemental surveys are carried out by non-specialist local inhabitants using simple and easy methods to monitor population indices, habitat changes and damage. The data from both surveys are used to develop the management plan for each protection area. However, since the AFCA is neither land owner nor land manager of serow protection areas, the measures that the AFCA can implement are limited to, for example, the prohibition of serow capture, monitoring of population and habitat etc.<br/> <br/> Control culling began in the restricted small areas of Gifu and Nagano Prefecture with tranquillizer guns only in 1978, and with shooting guns from 1979, and the culling area has expanded in central Honshu. As a matter of course, control cull is conducted outside the protection areas. The damage to conifer plantations in central Honshu markedly decreased in 1990s, because both the area of young conifer plantations and also population density of serow in this area have reduced. The number of serows removed in a year peaked at 1334 in 1996 and has decreased to about 500 in recent years. The total number of removed serow was about 37,000 by 2016. The serow control program that has been implemented since 1978 has led to a significant decrease of density in limited areas, but the impact on the whole population has not been remarkable. &#160;</p>  <p>Two kinds of permissions, based on LPCP and WPHL, are required for control culls of serow. The areas and periods of control, upper limit of cull number and capture methods are specified in the permits. Biological investigation of killed serow has continued since the beginning of the control. Place and date of capture, sex, age, and reproductive conditions are recorded for almost all culled individuals. In addition, studies in various fields such as ecology, morphology, pathology etc. were conducted in 1980s to 1990s. These data are used for serow management.&#160;</p>  <p>In 1999, the WPHL was amended and the ‘Specified Wildlife Management Plan System’ was established. This provided legal backing to manage local populations at each prefecture level. This plan must state specific goals for the target local populations, and prescribe concrete measure for properly controlled hunting and/or culling, preventing negative influences on the population, and conserving habitats. This adaptive management system is considered to be useful and practical for management of serow outside the protection areas. Eight prefectures are implementing such plans as of 2018, although control culling has not been conducted in two prefectures form the beginning and has been discontinued in one prefecture. &#160;</p>  <p>The management system for serow has significantly progressed during the last 40 years. While serow populations are stable or at least not at risk in most areas, the following problems negatively affect some populations.</p>  <p><ol><li>Reduction of undergrowth forage due to maturing conifer plantations from late 1950s to early 1980s, and abandonment of fuel wood forests, and over-grazing and/or browsing by sika deer may reduce food supply for serow and deteriorate habitat quality. In particular interspecific competition with sika deer, not only exploitation competition but also interference competition, are assumed to be an important cause of serow decline, though research concerning this matter is limited.</li><li>Increase of unintentional serow mortality associated with sika deer and wild boar control operations and damage prevention measure might have resulted in decrease of some local population.</li></ol></p>    <p>While the current national policy for sika deer and boar targets a 50% reduction of the population size by 2025, strict firearm control causes the use of snares and box traps as preferred methods of control. Moreover, the already few shooters are declining due to ageing. These social and political conditions in Japan place pressures to use traps and result in further worsening of the by-kill issues. The use of snare and box trap instead of guns is increasing in population control operations, and about 60% of sika deer and wild boar catches are by trapping. It is difficult to ban or strongly restrict the use of snare, under current social circumstances in Japan, but various efforts are underway to reduce by-kill.</p>  <p>There are two issues that currently serow management is facing.</p>  <p><ol><li>The top priority issues requiring urgent action are to avoid serow extinction in western Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, and recovery of these populations. It is necessary to clarify the feasible conservation procedures for these populations and create specific management plans for each population.</li><li>The second issue is distribution management of serow. The serow distribution has been expanding to low altitude areas, and overlap between serow distribution and cultivated land and human residential area is increasing. In addition, it is assumed that serow densities in the areas adjacent to farmland and residential areas is relatively high, while the densities in mountainous areas decrease. These phenomena should lead to an increase of conflict between serow and humans, such as damage on agriculture, human injuries caused by serow, and destruction of house gardens.</li></ol></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
22152905,9919,Hemitragus jemlahicus,Near Threatened,A2bcde,2020,2020-01-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Himalayan Tahr is listed as Near Threatened in view of the general prevalence of ‘old’ and ‘new’ threats, often increasing in intensity. There are small pockets with reasonable densities of tahr but vast areas devoid of them. Overall, tahr populations are on the decline, as indicated by sharp drops and disappearance in some areas, and declining habitat quality, ongoing poaching and impact of livestock as competitor, in other areas. It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years) and the species nearly meets the criteria A2bcde for Vulnerable, but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.","<p>Since Burrard’s (1925) hunting account, Himalayan Tahr has been known to traverse the steepest precipices. In general, they inhabit steep rocky mountain slopes, between 3,000–4,000 m asl, with woods and rhododendron <em>Rhodondendron</em> sp. scrub (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/></p>  <p>In Nepal, various surveys—like those in Kang Chu area (Schaller 1973), Everest National Park (Ale 2007), Langtang National Park (Green, 1979) and Annapurna Conservation Area (Gurung 1995)—reported that tahr occupy various habitat types from open alpine grassland and subalpine scrubland to sparse or even dense forests (tahr winter habitat). Precipitous cliffs break the continuity of these habitats. The best tahr habitat in the Everest region can be described as cliff faces broken by ledges supporting grasses, forbs and shrub mats at higher altitudes (mean 3,863 m, SE=0.9, range 3,260 m - 4,800 m, n=191) and patches of open pine or birch forest at lower altitude (mean 3,621 m, SE=1.4, range 3,300 m - 4,031 m, n=66). Tahr was reported from as high as 5,200 m (e.g., in Langtang: Fox 1974) and as low as 2,500 m in Kang Chu (Schaller 1977). In these mountains, steep hill slopes and undulating terrains are often characteristically interrupted by abrupt cliffs which act as oasis for these cliff-huggers whose presence is often predictive in these enclaves. This cliff-hugging behaviour of tahr restricts its own distribution (Ale 2007) and perhaps limits its group size as well. </p>  <p>Himalayan Tahr is diurnal, with varying group sizes depending on the degree of habitat ruggedness that characterizes particular localities. Group size of tahr is also influenced by the abundance of food and predation pressure. For instance, in Everest, group size ranged from 1-46 (average of ca. 8, n=277), during 2004 to 2006 (Lovari 1992, Ale 2007). The average group size increased over the decade in Everest perhaps in response to the return of snow leopards to the region (Ale 2007). Tahr formed comparatively larger groups in Annapurna Base Camp, Annapurna Conservation Area (13.8, range 1-57, n=134: Gurung 1995) and Langtang (average 15, largest group 77: Green 1979). Both Annapurna and Langtang lacked large predator, such as the snow leopard, in alpine and subalpine habitat, but most of these areas were characterized by undulating grasslands and scrublands thereby providing more plant forages for herbivores. <br/></p>  <p>The prevalence of local hunting may also influence the average group size. In Himachal Pradesh, western Himalaya (India), group size was very small (ca. 1.7, n = 7) with severe hunting in the past (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1983). This may have been reflected in the overall density reported from different study sites. In Everest, the tahr density was ca. 3.4/km<sup>2</sup> (with no human hunting but presence of large predator). Gurung (1995) reported tahr at the density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup> from Annapurna, with no human hunting and no large predator. In the absence of local hunting or natural predation, food can be the principle factor liming the size of populations. In overall Langtang (with no large predator and no human hunting), Tiwari (2006) reported 8.72 tahr/km<sup>2</sup> (8 herds, 218 individuals, in an area of 25 square kilometre). In the Langtang region of Langtang National Park, local density of tahr reached as high as 24/km<sup>2</sup> (Green 1979: 170 in 7 km<sup>2</sup>), where tahr was neither hunted nor its habitat grazed by livestock. On the other hand, Yala region of Langtang National Park, with ten times more domestic sheep and eight times more cattle than Langtang region, reached low tahr density (6/km<sup>2</sup>). In the absence of hunting in parts of New Zealand, tahr attained densities of &gt;30/km<sup>2 </sup>(Tustin and Challies, 1978). Female groups can reach very high densities in New Zealand, with groups of 100–150 commonly observed in areas that have not been hunted (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data). With regular hunting their population, however, maintained a density of ca. 5/km<sup>2</sup> (Tustin and Challies 1978)</p>  <p>Mating occurs from October to January, with it peaking around the first half of December (Lovari, S., unpubl. data). One or occasionally two kids are born in June and July after a gestation of 180-242 days. The age at sexual maturity is 1.5 years, with captive animals living up to 22 years (Smith <em>et al</em>., 2008). Females have home ranges of about 2 km<sup>2</sup> centred on rock bluffs. Males appear to be highly mobile, and outside of the rut are segregated from females (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data).</p>    <p>Himalayan Tahr is known to eat grass, herbs and some fruits. On Mt. Everest, tahr’s diets consisted typically of such grasses and sedges as <em>Carex, Avena</em>, <em>Poa</em>, <em>Trisetum</em>, <em>Cyperaceae</em> and <em>Imperata</em>. (Shrestha et al. 2002): overall, the diets were composed of 47% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 28% grasses and 25% sedges. This was similar to that Green (1979) reported for tahr in Langtang valley (38% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 34% grasses, 21% sedges, 4% ferns and 4% mosses). Green (1979) found in winter tahr supplemented its diet with small amounts of mosses and ferns, presumably because other food is less readily available. The diets of livestock and tahr were similar in the Everest region, but the proportion of woody plants (<em>Rhododendron</em> and <em>Cotoneaster</em>) was higher and that of grasses and sedges were lower in the diet of livestock than tahr. </p>","<p>The major threats in China are uncontrolled hunting and deforestation. In India, Himalayan Tahr is hunted for meat, and there is apparently significant competition with livestock for summer grazing in some areas. <span lang=""EN-IN"">Tahr possibly survive in small patches of steep, rugged forests around the sub-alpine zone, while much of its habitat is lost due to heavy pressure from local people and from developmental pressures. In Nepal, threats come from an expanding human population and accompanying increases in livestock, habitat loss, and poaching. As a result of these factors, tahr populations are becoming increasingly isolated. Besides threats related to anthropogenic activities, avalanches during winters with high snowfall also can be a significant mortality factor for tahr.</p>","<p>No global population estimate of Himalayan Tahr is currently available. The rate of its population change is unknown.<br/><br/>Only a few Himalayan Tahr have been observed in China (Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986). Perhaps, between 400 and 500 tahr, all located in southern Tibet, may exist in China (Wang 1998).<br/><br/>No estimate of tahr population in India is available, however, a number of sporadic counts of tahr are available from across the range. In Himachal Pradesh, for instance, approximately 130 in Kanawar Wildlife Sanctuary, and over 100 in Great Himalayan National Park (S. Pandey, pers. comm.) were reported. Population estimates have also been reported from parts of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary: 70 in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1994), and 110 in the Tungnath region of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Kittur <em>et al</em>. 2006). One survey between 1996 and 1998 indicated 50 tahr inhabiting Tirthan valley of the Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). Kandpal and Sathyakumar (2010) reported tahr from the Pindari glacier area. A recent high altitude ungulate survey in 2016 estimated 297 tahr (range: 222–565, 0.32 animals/sq. km) from Uttarakhand (Habib <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest several local extinctions of tahr in India (Sathyakumar, S., unpubl. data). They may be close to extirpation from western parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The entire population reported earlier from north of the Chenab River (between Kisthwar and the Banihal pass) is believed to be locally extinct now. Small populations of tahr survive in Bani-Sarthal (Kathua) and Kisthwar National Park (Kisthwar-Doda) (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Density estimates ranging from as high as 19.6 to 25.7<span lang=""EN-IN""> per km² (Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttarakhand) (Sathyakumar 1994) and from as low as 1.4 to 4.6 <span lang=""EN-IN"">per km² (Great Himalayan National Park, Himachal Pradesh) (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999) have been reported from different parts of Western Himalaya.<br/><br/></span>A different abundance index, that is, encounter rates (number/km walked) indicated tahr was less abundant in Nanda Devi National Park than Tungnath in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1993, 1994). Also, the tahr population was denser in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary than Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). A camera trap survey (trap nights/100 days) from the upper catchment of Bhagirathi River revealed higher abundance of tahr in temperate habitat (4.4 ± 2.62) than alpine habitat (0.6 ± 0.34) (Pal <em>et al</em>., in press). In Sikkim, an intensive study in Prek Chu Catchment found the presence of Himalayan Tahr in subalpine and alpine zone, but they were rare compared to other ungulates such as blue sheep (Bhattacharya 2013).<br/><br/>No total population size estimates of tahr are available for Nepal, but there have been several sporadic surveys from different parts of the country over the decades. Bauer (1988) estimated 1,000 tahr for Sagamartha, Makalu-Barun and Langtang National Parks. These three regions obviously support more tahr than Bauer’s estimates, as revealed by relatively recent studies (see below).<br/><br/>Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park can easily support 700-800 tahr, at least half of them occurring in Namche, Phorste, Thame and Gokyo valleys, in an area of <em>ca</em> 160 km². The overall mean group size was 8.5, from 2004 to 2006, with an overall density of 3.4/km2 (Lovari et al. 2009, Ale 2007). Between 1989 and 2010, there was a decrease of tahr by some 2/3, from ca 350 to <em>ca</em> 100 tahr, in the core area of Sagarmatha National Park because of increased predation following the return of the snow leopard (Lovari &amp; Mishra 2016). The recent data are lacking but numbers of predator and prey may have estabilised by now in Everest (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The most recent survey, in 2012, revealed a minimum of 394 tahr from Langtang in ca. 79.3 km² (density 5.3 tahr/km²: Thapa 2012). Green’s (1978) density estimates in Langtang National Park were similar in some localities (6.8 per sq. km) but in other localities they reached as high as s 25.0 per square kilometre.<br/><br/>Tahr has been reported from all of Nepal’s mountain protected areas but there have been no systematic surveys in these parks. No data on tahr are available from Gaurishankar Conservation Area, but in 2010 a short survey on the status of snow leopards also revealed the presence of tahr in Rolwaling valley in Gaurishankar. Their numbers, however, were dwindling (just 12 individuals observed, although with a decent kid-to-female ratio of 0.7: Ale <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent survey (Devkota <em>et al</em>. 2017) in an area of 124.2 km<sup>2</sup> in the upper reaches of Tsum valley, in Manaslu Conservation Area, revealed 223 tahr (nine herds, average group size of 25, range 2 to 74 individuals; a density of 1.8 animals per km<sup>2</sup>). Earlier in 2012, just two-day observations yielded at least 400 in the Tsum Valley and a similar number from the Budhi Gandhaki Valley in Manaslu (Sandro Lovari and Madhu Chettri, unpubl. data). The recent status of tahr in Annapurna Conservation Area is lacking but Gurung (1995) counted over 500 tahr in Annapurna Base Camp (density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>A total of 285 tahr were reported from Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve by Kandel <em>et al</em>. (2011). Tahr has been sighted in Shey Phoksundo, Khaptad, and Rara National Parks, in western Nepal. Even though there have been no formal surveys, each of these parks were reported to support at least 50 tahr, according to local experts (quoted in Gurung, 1995). Many districts that fall outside of protected areas, such as Dolpo, Jumla, Humla and Jajarkot, have been reported to contain sparse populations of tahr (Raju Acharya, Karan B. Shah, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest that considerable local extinctions of tahr have taken place in Nepal. Overall, conservative estimates of tahr population for entire Nepal may not exceed 10,000 (Som B. Ale, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The potential habitat of Himalayan Tahr, worldwide, between 2,200 m and 4,200 m elevation, is estimated at <em>c.</em> 44,200 km<sup>2</sup> with most areas being in Nepal (that is, 22,455 km<sup>2</sup>), followed by India (20,248 km<sup>2</sup>) and China (1,465 km<sup>2</sup>). Suitable tahr habitat occurs in Himachal Pradesh (8,903 km<sup>2</sup>), Uttarakhand (6,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and Sikkim (865 km<sup>2</sup>), and Jammu and Kashmir (3,979 km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>The current global population of Himalayan Tahr in its native range (that is, China, India and Nepal) is difficult to estimate due to the paucity of data, but it may not exceed the size of introduced populations in New Zealand, South Africa, United States of America, and Argentina (likely extinct). No attempts to census tahr populations have been made from the other countries except from New Zealand. The total abundance of tahr in New Zealand alone, from 2016 to 2018, was placed between 24,777 and 47,461, with average density ranging from 0.06 to 9.2 tahr/km<sup>2</sup>.</p>",Decreasing,"Himalayan Tahr is found in the Himalaya of China, India and Nepal spread over an estimated 44,200 km², however the actual area of occurrence may be much smaller given extirpation and currently unsuitable habitats in between. Outside the Himalayas, tahr was introduced to the South Island of New Zealand and Western Cape Province in South Africa (Grubb 2005). They were accidentally released in Cibola National Forest Mountain (New Mexico, USA) from a game ranch, and in Neuquén province and Parque Diana ranch of Argentina perhaps illegally by ranchers (Flueck 2010), and possibly now extinct from Neuquén (Guichon <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In China, Himalayan Tahr was discovered in 1974 in Quxiang of Buoqu Valley (aka Zhangmu Valley) in southern Tibet (Beijing Natural History Museum and Qinghai Institute of Biology 1977). Since then, there has been no additional information pertaining to its occurrence or status. A confirmed report of species presence came from Tibet’s Geelong-Buoqu Valleys (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986, Wang 1998, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Qomolangma Nature Reserve (pers. comm., Labaciren) where numbers of tahr have been sighted regularly in the Rongxia and Chentang valleys.<br/><br/>In India, Himalayan Tahr occurs along subalpine regions across southern forested slopes in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim (Sathyakmuar 2002). Populations are patchily distributed from south-central Kashmir through the southern part of Kullu (Himachal Pradesh) between c. 2,000 and 3,300 m (Gaston et al. 1981, 1983). They are widely present at similar elevations from northern Uttarakhand all the way to the border of Nepal. Small numbers of tahr also inhabit east Sikkim (nearby India-Nepal border) and west Sikkim (close to India-Bhutan border).<br/><br/>In Nepal, Himalayan Tahr formerly had a continuous distribution between 1,500 m and 5,200 m, but this has been increasingly disrupted by human activities such as livestock-grazing and subsistence hunting (Green 1978, 1979, Ale, S. B. unpubl. data). Overall, in Nepal, tahr inhabits temperate to sub-alpine forests and alpine meadows, mainly between <em>ca</em> 2,500 m and 4,000 m, but individuals at times venture up to 5,200 m. Schaller (1977) mapped fourteen locations of tahr in Nepal, but there are undoubtedly more.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, tahr is reported from the Jigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve (Tshewang <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Bhutan Government’s Nature Conservation Division of the Department of Forest and Park Services has not confirmed its presence in the country (Sonam Wangdi, December 2019, pers. comm.).","<p>In New Zealand, there is occasional commercial harvesting of tahr for meat. There is a substantial recreational hunt of this species, and adult males (≥4.5 years old) are highly sought after as trophies by recreational and trophy hunters.</p>  In Nepal’s only in one hunting reserve, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Himalayan Tahr is harvested for trophy (blue sheep, <em>Pseudois nayaur</em>, were more sought after than Himalayan Tahr). The income thus generated has been used for conservation and local income generation activities (Karki and Thapa 2011). Two types of revenue have been generated through trophy hunting: the revenue collected by the Nepal’s government’s wildlife department, and money collected by local communities (although not substantiated on a legal basis, so monetary figures are not known: the charge to hunters may have varied from $533–1,333 for a Himalayan Tahr (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015). Locals used the money collected from tahr and blue sheep trophy-hunting for community development activities, for example, upgrading facilities of the local health post, constructing trails, and maintaining a bridge. Government revenue collected from 2007 to 2012 totalled $184,372, a portion of which went to conservation activities (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Terrestrial,"<p>Himalayan Tahr is not listed under threatened category of CITES. </p>  <p>It is listed as Category I species in China. Conservation measures proposed for China included undertaking surveys to determine the species’ distribution and status in Qomolangma Nature Reserve&#160;(Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Qomolangma&#160;Nature Reserve started the snow leopard program in 2015 funded by Vanke Foundation. The program undertook a large-scale wildlife survey and subsequent conservation projects that included educating local communities about tahr and other wildlife. </p>  <p>In India, protected areas with Himalayan Tahr include: Jammu and Kashmir – Kishtwar National Park (locally threatened); Himachal Pradesh - Great Himalayan National Park (confirmed), and Daranghati (locally threatened), Gamgul Siahbehi, Kanawar, Khokhan, Kugti, Manali (locally threatened or extinct), Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah (locally threatened) Wildlife Sanctuaries; Uttarakhand -Nanda Devi and (probably) Valley of Flowers National Parks, Govind Pashu Vihar and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuaries; and Sikkim - Khangchendzonga National Park (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981, 1983, Green 1987; Kathayat and Mathur 2002). Tahr uses rugged forested slopes with temperate oak and pine forests, well below the subalpine areas where it is often currently located. This suggests that its current range distribution may reflect displacement from formerly used lower elevation areas. Conservation measures proposed for India include: 1) extend the Great Himalayan National Park as proposed, 2) establish the proposed Srikhand National Park (Himachal Pradesh), 3) devise innovative community based reserves for the species outside protected areas (these need to include community based protection, tourism, awareness, etc.), and 4) include areas with tahr in the innovative, participatory, landscape level planning and action under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Project Snow Leopard. Overall, the country’s conservation strategy clearly states conserving species in and outside protected areas.</p>  <p>A significant proportion of Nepal’s tahr occurs within protected areas, but its population is widespread in areas outside of protected areas (e.g., the region that lies between Manaslu and Langtang, Bhimthang valley between Manalsu and Annapurna, and Dolpo, Jumla, Mugu and Humla districts). The species occurs in all mountain protected areas of Nepal: Langtang, Rara, Sagamartha (Everest), Makalu-Barun and Shey-Phoksundo National Parks; Api Nampa, Annapurna, Manalsu, Gaurishankar and Kanchanjunga Conservation Areas, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, and Khaptad National Park. </p>  <p>Conservation measures proposed for Nepal: 1) maintain the current, closely controlled, legal hunting program in Dhorpatan, 2) consider a regulated program of low-level subsistence hunting by local villagers, and 3) undertake surveys to understand the increasing fragmentation of tahr populations and offer mitigation measures. The first steps to address this issue would be to begin in selected areas by mapping tahr habitat features such as cliffs (using 1:50,000 topographic maps), followed by ground surveys to validate the species’ presence/absence.</p>  <p>Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is the only reserve in Nepal that allows trophy hunting of Himalayan Tahr along with blue sheep. From 2008 to 2011, Karki and Thapa (2011) reported 34 Himalayan Tahr were harvested: 18 in 2008/09 (100% harvest; quota set by the government), 11 (61% in 2009/10) and 5 (28 % in 2010/11). A quick glance on the numbers harvested indicates they were not so small numbers if adult males have been the only target. It would mean some 10-15 % of the adult male (trophy) population (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm). Perhaps the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation – Nepal should consider revaluating the trophy hunting of tahr on a sustainable basis.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
22158895,10054,Hippocamelus bisulcus,Endangered,"B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v); C2a(i)",2016,2015-10-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is confirmed to be Endangered because of an ongoing decline due to natural and anthropogenic factors (e.g. habitat loss, hunting, poaching and predation), reduction in range (area of occupancy) and because remaining populations are small and fragmented. The area of occupancy reflects the fact that the Huemul will not usually occur throughout the area of its extent of occurrence, which contains unsuitable or unoccupied habitats. Population estimates for this species are a minimum of 1,048 and a maximum of 1,500 (López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1998, Povilitis 1983, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000). Densities of 5-8.6 Huemul/km² have been reported in well-studied groups (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Frid 1999, Grosse 1949, Wensing 2005), and based on body size, Huemul are expected to occur at densities of about five deer/km² (Damuth 1987) in their prime habitat. The population is severely fragmented (Vila <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1998, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Vila <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006). There were 101 subpopulations recognized, 60% are found within one grid of max. 64 km² (often 10-20 individuals), 15% of groups are found within two grids of max. 128 km² (often 10-30 animals), and 8% of populations are found within areas of only 192 km² (often 10-30 animals) (Povilitis 1998, 2003).<br/><br/>The species is also listed under criterion C because there are fewer than 2,500 mature individuals and there is a continuing and projected decline in numbers of mature individuals (Vila <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1998, Povilitis 1983, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000).","<strong>Habitat:</strong><br/>At present, the Huemul occurs mainly in the Andes mountains, from sea-level up to 3,000 m elevation, and now is found mainly at the forest edge and forests of southern beech (<em>Nothofagus </em>spp.). Locally, Huemul are still found in a variety of habitats: from valley flats to steep mountain slopes, from open grasslands to closed shrubby or forested habitats, inclusive of post-fire or mixed habitats. The pattern of using different habitat components has been found to vary and depends on availability, season, phenology, presences of other herbivores and predators, or disturbances, and is reflected in its broad dietary spectrum (see below). Annual home range size in some currently used habitat has been estimated to be about 350-650 ha with daily travel distances of up to 8 km, but rarely more than 5 km (reviewed in Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Gill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). Serret (2001) postulated that in Argentina the optimum habitat was the transition between the forest and the steppe, but the introduction of sheep and cattle farming and the urbanization in this ecoregion displaced the Huemul populations to the forested areas. Much earlier, Onelli observed in 1897 that most lowland areas he visited already had lost Huemul due to human presence and overhunting (cited in Gigoux 1929), and Magne de la Croix (1937) considered that human pressure was responsible for Huemul only remaining in high mountains at that time. The general displacement of Huemul from traditional winter areas, lowlands or habitats far from forested Andes has been summarized by the Huemul Task Force (2012) and Flueck and Smith-Flueck (2011a, 2012a). In the past, Huemul also occurred in completely treeless areas of the Patagonian grasslands (Díaz 1993, 2000, Frid 1994, Huemul Task Force 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Group size:</strong><br/>Huemul may form small unisex or mixed groups of 2-3 individuals in low-density populations (e.g. 1.79 ± 0.33 ind./km², Corti 2008). The main populations of Huemul are now concentrated primarily on the eastern facing slopes of the Patagonian Andes, and along Chile’s southern coast and associated archipelago. Coastal populations in the Bernardo O’Higgings National Park, Regions of Aysen and Magallanes showed a pattern for group size of seven individuals in the area of Fiordo Tempano, and groups of eight individuals at a density of 8.64 ind./km² in Fiordo Bernardo (Wensing 2005), as well as groups of 8 in Torres del Paine National Park (Guineo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). Groups of 10 Huemul during summer were reported by Grosse (1949). In the Protected Park Shoonem of Alto Rio Senguer (Prov. Chubut, Argentina) it is common to see larger groups in autumn and winter. For instance, there are reports of groups of 11 Huemul (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000), and local staff report Huemul groups of up to 17. However, historically Huemul formed large wintering groups and reports of 50 or over 100 exist (e.g. Prichard 1902, reviews in Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000 and Huemul Task Force 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Density:</strong><br/>In Torres del Paine National Park, Magallanes - Chile, in the Grey area, Pehoé and part of Dickson Lakes there is a Huemul population of at least 60 individuals with a density of 0.7 Huemuls/km² (Guineo and Garay 2014). Within the province of Rio Negro - Argentina, population density in the lower Manso River averaged 1 ind./km² (Smith-Flueck and Flueck 1997), similar to the density reported for Lago Cochrane National Reserve (Corti 2008). The lowest density (0.4 ind./km²) was register in Nevados de Chillán, Biobío, the only population of Huemuls remaining in Central Chile (Povilitis 1978, 1998). In Fiordo Bernardo, Chile, Huemul occurred at a density of 8.64 ind./km² (Wensing 2005). <br/><br/><strong>Predators:</strong><br/>Predators of the Huemul include humans, Pumas (<em>Puma concolor</em>), Culpeo Foxes (<em>Pseudalopex culpaeus</em>) and domestic dogs. Predation can be a major limiting factor of Huemul and even threaten the viability of some remaining subpopulations when reduced to small groups (Wittmer <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Huemul are particularly at risk from predation from Pumas (primarily known to kill adult Huemul) and Culpeo Foxes (primarily known to kill fawns) in the form of apparent competition (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Elbroch and Wittmer 2013, Wittmer <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013a). A fawn was observed being killed by a fox, then chased off by the Huemul mother (Wensing 2005, Paulo Corti unpubl.). Saucedo and Gill (2004) reported several fawns being killed by foxes. Hershkovitz (1972) described the several species of foxes, like Culpeo Fox, as dog-like or coyote-like in general appearance and habits. However, two studies of Culpeo Fox diet analysis did not find evidence for Huemul fawn in the diet even during partutition in a syntopic area (Zapata <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Jiménez and Martinez 2010). Puma have been shown to be an important ultimate mortality factor in one subpopulation (Smith-Flueck and Flueck 2001). Huemul will escape persistent pursuers by fleeing, by seeking refuge on cliffs or by using lakes, being very efficient swimmers. When threatened by predators, Huemul may attempt avoidance by first remaining motionless or hiding. However, when discovered at close range they will rapidly flee. Huemul have the capacity to learn and have been observed to increase their flight distance in relation to disturbance activity (M.L. Thomas and O. Guineo pers. comm., Frid 2001).<br/><br/>Close to human settlements and near ranches, Huemul also appear at risk from predation from domestic dogs. For example, Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) reported that dogs near the town of Cochrane in Chilean Patagonia were responsible for 16% of observed mortalities of marked Huemul fawns. Hunting and poaching have historically been a major limiting and exterminating factor for Huemul, the extent to which poaching continues to affect Huemul is less clear. <br/><br/><em>Feeding behaviour:</em><br/>Studies so far showed the number of plant species in the diet as low as 11 and as high as 120 in Torres del Paine (Guineo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008), which is dependent on the vegetation community, pressure from other herbivores, predators and disturbances. On the other hand, females spent 93 % of their foraging time on only two plant species during the summer-fall season at Fiord Tempano in O’Higgins National Park (van Winden 2006). Gramineae in the summer diet was as low as 0.1% (Smith-Flueck 2003) or as high as 16% (Sierralta 2003). The results of these and other studies shows that the diet of Huemul can vary substantially from one subpopulation to another (also see Smith-Flueck 2003, Galende <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Seasonal movements: </strong><br/>Huemul have high site fidelity when moving from low elevations in winter to high elevations in summer. A few historical reports refer to the vertical movements of the Huemul (Cabrera and Yepes 1960, Giai 1936, Krieg 1940, Housse 1953, Prichard 1902). In contemporary works, this seasonal movement was suggested in Chillán areas (López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, Povilitis 1978) and confirmed in Torres del Paine (Guineo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008), Los Glaciares (Serret and Borghiani 1997) and Los Alerces National Parks (Díaz <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Results obtained with collared animals at three study sites in Aysen, Chile, show that those Huemul undertake a modest seasonal migration or none at all. The majority of distances covered between successive locations were less than 1 km and only few over 5 km (Gill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003, 2008, Saucedo and Echeñique 2003). Previous reports of movements for unmarked Huemul ranged from 2.0 to 6.7 km for a translocated female in Torres del Paine National Park (Rau 1980) and 2.0 to 4.1 km in the Chillán area (López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2000, Povilitis 1998). <br/><br/>Although in 1992 several factors were hypothesized to explain the lack of Huemul recovery (cattle, exotic trees, irrational forestry, exotic animals, illegal hunting, diseases, dogs, reduced numbers, loss of winter range), each when taken alone is problematic as a key explanation for the general lack of recovery (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006, 2011a).","The widespread reduction in numbers and distributional range across the full extent of the historic range (Redford and Eisenberg 1992) was likely due to a combination from overkill, overstocking with domestic livestock (feral and controlled animals), land conversion for agricultural purposes, and building of towns and roads. This process started before the arrival of Spaniards and peaked before the first systematic accounts were made (Miller 1980), more details remain to be elucidated. Based on the chronology of human settlement, the historical impact would have been earlier in the northern than in the southern portion of the distribution, and earliest possibly in the northwestern portion, which is the central valley of Chile. <br/><br/>The major reduction in numbers and distribution resulted in an increased fragmentation of the population. The resulting subpopulations continue to be affected by a variety of factors, which keep their numbers low or decreasing. It is under these specific local circumstances that myriad biophysical factors can become crucial: human infrastructure, livestock grazing, farming, poaching, predators, new diseases, uncontrolled and/or feral dogs, or unregulated tourism. Huemul subpopulations from such a large variety of habitats and circumstances can be expected to be of different average physical condition, and thus might respond differently to any given factor. <br/><br/>One important omnipresent threat is that Chile and Argentina have weak mechanisms to protect Huemul in non-protected areas, and even inside protected areas. The many problematic activities in areas still containing Huemul are mainly related to livestock production, forest products, mining and tourism of all types including fishing and hunting. <br/><br/>Another omnipresent and continuous threat is lack of suitable winter range. Whereas some subpopulations have access to a sufficient altitudinal range within a small area (due to steepness of terrain), others would need to migrate over much longer distances, particularly on the eastern slopes of the Andes. In all cases, if the winter range is basically occupied by humans a subpopulation may be hindered from recovering. Most historical winter ranges on the eastern slopes are private and are used intensely for livestock production and/or hunting. This includes many protected areas including the national reserves of national parks. Notable exceptions are the Torres del Paine (Chile) and Perito Moreno (Argentina) National Parks: livestock production was removed and Huemul eventually recolonized low-lands, even into steppe areas (Guineo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008, Mirabelli 2010). However, in the former, horses and cattle still forage freely in Huemul ranges (Jimenez pers. obs.). Besides loss of winter ranges, migratory behavioral patterns have also been eliminated, as Huemul reaching those winter ranges were regularly killed. <br/><br/>The local circumstances of a given subpopulation would determine the need for specific research to address the problems and to find adequate counter measures (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Food competition from other herbivores</strong><br/>Currently, but certainly in the past, Huemul formed part of a natural multi-herbivore system. As in any such system, it is the combined herbivore pressure on forage that is of interest. Huemul and red deer diets in a lenga forest habitat overlapped between 42 to 62%, depending on the season (Smith-Flueck 2003). Some Huemul populations persist, even after having been in the presence of cattle production for over 110 years (Flueck 2010). The broad dietary breadth of Huemul and the variety of environments occupied historically and concurrently corroborate the co-existence of Huemul with native Pudu, Guanaco, and feral cattle during several hundred years (Flueck 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Diseases</strong><br/>In Argentina, veterinary records indicate the presence of dangerous diseases near Huemul populations, as raising livestock is a major economy for the region. In Chile, screening of 18 Huemul for infectious agents did not detect antibodies for bovine herpesvirus-1 nor Brucella abortus, only two Huemul had antibodies for bovine viral diarrhea even though this population had been exposed to sheep and cattle for at least 80 years (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Flueck and Smith-Flueck (2012c) reported on several disease agents: adult females did not reveal ectoparasites (n=73) and testing for antibodies for foot-and-mouth disease viral antigen was negative (n=41). <em>Fasciola hepatica</em> was encountered in three surveys at prevalence from 9% to 50% (n=108). <em>Taenia ovis krabbei</em> was identified, and <em>Cysticerus tenuicollis</em> was found at a prevalence of 8% (n=12). <em>Ostertagia </em>sp., <em>Bunostomum </em>sp. and Dictyocaulus sp. had a prevalence of 75%, 25% and 13% (n=9), respectively. Several gastrointestinal parasites reported at low prevalence in Huemul are common in livestock and are considered commensals in domestic ruminants.<br/><br/>Flueck and Smith-Flueck (2008) reported on bone disease in Huemul from Argentina. Osteopathology was found in 57% of adults, 63% showed mandibular, 100% maxillary and 78% appendicular lesions. These skeletal lesions would affect the capacity for predator avoidance, suggested as an explanation for the population's low average adult age (3.1 years) and lack of recovery. <br/><br/>Recently, Selenium (Se) deficiency was found in the first Huemul population examined so far (Cochrane, Chile), with plasma Se deficient in 73% of individuals (Flueck <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014a). The examination of skeletal remains from the same population revealed bone lesions with a pathophysiognomy similar to Argentine cases, but more severe, and importantly, occurring in a population of Se deficient Huemul (details under 'Seasonal movements' in the section Habitat and Ecology). The role Se deficiency plays in limiting Huemul is ambiguous, because there is no single definition for “healthy population” for either wild or domestic animals (Chihuailaf and Corti 2014) and Huemul has survived since the Pleistocene (Marín <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) in habitats dominated by volcanic soils lacking in Se (reviewed by Chihuailaf <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Predation</strong><br/>Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) reported dogs were responsible for 16% of observed mortalities of marked Huemul, based on tracks, scats, hair, state of the carcass and predator sightings (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Other subpopulations though have declined in the absence of dogs, and the nature of local threats has to be determined for each subpopulation. Where predation is severe, including by native predators, small Huemul subpopulations may not be able to recover without management intervention (Wittmer <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Recovering Huemul populations affected by predation might require reducing abundant primary prey and simultaneous predator reductions, at least temporarily (Wittmer <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013b). Culpeo Fox were identified as a major source of Huemul fawn morality during one radiocollar study in Southern Argentina (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010), but not during a fox diet study in the same region (Zapata <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005). Also, Jiménez and Martinez (2010) did not find evidence of Huemul preyed or scavenged at Tamango National Reserve when examining 409 Culpeo scats along one year in a high density breeding Huemul area. More study on the source of fawn mortality is warranted. <br/><br/><strong>Genetic problems</strong><br/>Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2011) assessed genetic variability using 14 microsatellite loci in one isolated population in Chile. They sampled 56 individuals between 2005 and 2007 and found low genetic variability, whereas the low inbreeding coefficient suggested nearly random mating which would maximize the maintenance of genetic variation. As there is no apt information on Huemul, the precautionary principle indicates that increasing the size of subpopulations by all means should be a major objective.","The species occurs in fragmented subpopulations with reported densities ranging from 0.02 - 5.66 deer/km² and averaging 1.25 (n=17) (reviewed in Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000), however, some estimates included unoccupied areas. Wensing (2005) measured 8.64 Huemul/km² in coastal Chile. It has been estimated that no more than 1,000 animals survive in Chile (Drouilly 1983) and 500 in Argentina (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006), resulting from reductions of over 99% in population size and of over 50% in distribution (Redford and Eisenberg 1992). In Argentina, the remaining Huemul reside along 1,850 km of Andes in about 50 subpopulations, which are mostly fragmented (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006). In 2006, there was an estimated 101 subpopulations of Huemul, but 60 of these only lived within 8x8 km², whereas another 15 lived within 8x16 km². Of these 65 subpopulations, 67% are outside of protected areas (Vila <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). In Chile, most Huemul populations are concentrated in coastal Patagonian, where extensive habitat is still present in almost a continuous form. However, fragmentation increases northwards on the mainland. Only a few subpopulations of Huemul in Chile seem to be stable (Tamango and Castillo National Reserves, Torres del Paine National Park, some southern coastal subpopulations). One subpopulation in central Chile has been declining (Povilitis 1998), but trends for most subpopulations are unknown, or only became clear when local extinctions were evident. Although in some localities in Chile and Argentina sightings have increased in recent times, it has not been shown to be due to a numeric response.",Decreasing,"The Huemul is endemic to Chile and Argentina and currently only inhabits the Andes of southern Chile and Argentina (Vila <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). The subpopulation in the Nevados de Chillán area (VIII Region of Chile) has the greatest degree of isolation, with a distance of about 400 km from the nearest subpopulation to the south in Nahuel Huapi National Park (Argentina, 40º30'S, SIB-Administración de Parques Nacionales, <a href=""http://www.sib.gov.ar"">www.sib.gov.ar</a>). The southern part of Lanin National Park (Argentina) may still have a subpopulation, but the latest surveys did not detect the specie (Pastore <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>However, there were skeletal remains reported in Laguna Fria, Lanin National Park. A male was photographed in Nahuel Huapi National Park and sightings have been reported in this park (SIB-Administración de Parques Nacionales, www.sib.gov.ar). The current distribution has a high degree of fragmentation, with the coastal populations in Chilean Patagonia being the least fragmented, and the most continuous stretch of populations being in areas that are nearly void of human presence (Corti <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005). The degree of isolation of subpopulations within much of the region, or its effects, remains, however, unclear.<br/>&#160;<br/>The historical distribution range of Huemul covered a latitudinal range of 20 degrees along about 2,000 km. In southern Patagonia Huemul reached the Atlantic, and whereas it occurred in the Patagonian steppe to the north, it is presently uncertain how far east they might have reached (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000). Formerly the Huemul occurred along the Andes south of River Cachapoal (34°) to the Strait of Magellan (54ºS) in Chile, and from approximately 36° 50’S to southern Santa Cruz Province, Argentina (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000). However, even recently a Huemul was photographed at 36° 41’S near the Argentine border (Vidoz 2012). As a result of pre- and post-Columbian events, there are few historic documents of Huemul existing in extra-Andean landscapes (reviewed in Huemul Task Force 2012), but the suitability of lower elevations for Huemul is evidenced from fossil remains (Perez and Batres 2008) and anecdotal reports (see Díaz 1993, 2000).","Commercialized illegal hunting may no longer occur, or would be limited likely due to increased public awareness. Poaching is mainly by local people, occurs for various reasons: for fish bait along the Pacific coast, for food for ranch dogs and people, and simply to collect a trophy. A risk for accidental or intentional kills occurs in areas with officially permitted commercial hunting of exotic game species. Commercial sport hunting of Red Deer and feral pigs, for instance, is allowed in several areas with Huemul (including some in National Parks). In Huemul areas, these commercial activities should not be allowed; if control hunting is deemed necessary, it should be preferably a task only for the government agencies' staff -if this is not possible, it should be under strict supervision from these agencies. In any case, control should be performed only if a sound and scientifically based plan is in place. The use of dogs should be strictly regulated in all the areas of Huemul distribution. In National Parks in Argentina, a new stricter regulation is in place (Res. HD 59/13), which is being enforced successfully in some Huemul areas but not yet in others. In Chile, a new law that ban dogs from protected areas was just passed. Aside from intentional poaching, dogs accompanying local people may kill Huemul which are then utilized. Hunting with dogs for other species like feral pigs may result in by-catch kills of Huemul. Eco-tourism also exists with organized viewing Huemul in the wild (for instance <a href=""http://doslagoslodge.com"">http://doslagoslodge.com</a>), but no formal management of these activities has been established.",Terrestrial,"As 63% of all subpopulations are outside of protected areas (and another 9% are partially outside), there is an urgent need to establish management plans for most of the remaining Huemul subpopulations. The Huemul is classified as Endangered in the Chilean and Argentinean Red Data Books of Vertebrates (Glade 1988, Díaz and Ojeda 2000) and is also listed in the Appendix I of CITES and UNEP/CMS Conventions. This species has been protected by law since 1929 in Chile and 1989 in parts of Argentina (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000). In order to promote Huemul conservation, six binational workshops have been conducted since 1992. In 2001, both countries developed their national Huemul conservation plans (Chile began with an update in 2007), but funding constraints have thus far impeded their implementation. The species occurs in 13 Chilean national parks and reserves (Corti <em>et al.</em> 2005), and details about populations occurring outside of protected areas are either barely known or unknown. In Argentina, Huemul occur in five national parks plus several provincial reserves. Both countries also have some private reserves with Huemul populations. Nevertheless, only 28% of the 101 identified subpopulations in both countries were found within existing protected areas, 63% were located outside of protected areas, while 9% were found partially within protected areas (Vila <em>et al.</em> 2006).The public system of protected areas contains extensive habitat formerly and currently still used by Huemul, making it a prime candidate for contributing significantly to Huemul recovery (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006). An urgent task is thus to find ways to extend the implementation and control of existing policies established for protected areas (Martin and Chehebar 2001, Rusch 2002). <br/><br/>Some conservation measures currently prioritized by government agencies of both countries include: increase efforts to obtain more information on Huemul subpopulations such as the current distribution, abundance, and threats; encourage more effective protection of the identified subpopulations (emphasizing an increase of protection in the VIII and XI regions of Chile and in the Province of Chubut of Argentina); promote the creation of private protected areas with presence of Huemul (or suitable habitat) to facilitate connectivity and dispersal; promote training to improve local skills in wildlife management and monitoring techniques; and encourage educational activities and media campaigns to raise awareness about the Huemul´s status (Smith-Flueck <em>et al.</em> 2014). Achieving these measures would be more likely through coordination (also binationally) among the several administrative jurisdictions, private owners, and local communities.<br/><br/>The present state of Huemul with its high degree of spatial fragmentation, small subpopulation sizes, and low total number (Vila <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates that the situation is not viable, and may be less so in Argentina with only a few hundred remaining Huemul. The trend follows a continued loss of subpopulations, i.e., a reduction in numbers and area of occupancy, even within national parks (Franke 1949, Povilitis 1998, Serret 2001). The goal is the species’ recovery (e.g. Argentina National Huemul Conservation and Recovery Plan, 2001), which implies an increase in numbers and distribution to a viable level. For recovery to succeed, threats to individual remaining Huemul subpopulations need to be understood (Corti <em>et al.</em> 2005). Making decisions about corrective measures should be based on understanding these threats, and would take conservation beyond the creation of protected areas. Basic information on the species and on most subpopulations is very scarce, which complicates interpretations of some observations. A recovery strategy for Huemul must also include <em>ex situ</em> tools, as for many of the questions, the most efficient, and sometimes only, approach would be controlled studies of semi-captive animals (a successful captive center occurs in Chile since 2005, Vidal <em>et al.</em> 2011). It would also provide opportunities to study re-introduced groups (stemming from the captive breeding center), taking an adaptive management approach (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006, Armstrong and Seddon 2007). The Huemul captive centre in Chile is planning their first re-introduction of five Huemul for later in 2015. In consequence, several additional conservation measures surfaced that need to be incorporated: 1) Scientific research should be facilitated by all agencies involved and for any existing Huemul subpopulation; 2) Centres with semi-captive Huemul for studies and re-introductions function as a valuable recovery tool and should be facilitated, particularly when non-competing funds are available. Efforts should be directed to gain a maximum of information through research under controlled conditions and through reintroductions; 3) Once subpopulations are known to be recovering numerically and spatially, they should become a research focus in order to determine the reasons for the recovery; and 4) The groups assigned to coordinate a centralized and country-wide conservation effort based on Huemul National Plans (“Comisión Nacional” in Chile, “Comité de Gestión” in Argentina) need to adopt a policy of transparency.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

On the Togian Islands, Babirusas were also sighted in mixed gardens, coconut plantations, regrowing scrub of former ‘ladang’, secondary forest, village edges, freshwater and mangrove swamps, and other coastal habitats (Akbar <em>et al.</em> 2007).&#160; Togian Islands Babirusas are mainly active in the morning or late afternoon, generally resting in cool places during the hot daytime periods, but they have also been seen active in the daytime, even in cultivated areas if disturbance is low (Selmier 1983, Ito <em>et al.</em> 2005, Akbar<em> et al.</em> 2007) .</p>    <p>In common with most of the other suids, Babirusas are omnivorous and both wild and captive individuals consume a wide variety of leaf, root, fruit and animal matter (invertebrates and small vertebrates).

Although detailed studies of their diet in the wild still need to be carried out, a review of the available information from the wild combined with studies on the stomachs and digestive abilities of captive animals suggest that from an anatomical/digestive point of view, they are most likely non-ruminant forestomach fermenting frugivores/concentrate selectors (Leus <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Their jaws and teeth are reported to be strong enough to crack very hard nuts with ease. However, Babirusa do not exhibit the rooting behaviour typical of other suids because of the absence of a prominent rostral bone in the nose (Macdonald 2016). They will probe soft sand as well as wet, muddy places for food.</p>    <p>On the Togian Islands troops of up to eleven individuals have been observed (Ito <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). During interview surveys on the Togian Islands, 37% of respondents considered Babirusas to be solitary, 29.6% reported them to occur in groups composed of one adult pair with a litter and 29.5% of respondents reported a group size of more than 5 typically composed of an adult males with multiple females and their litters (Akbar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Litters count 1-2 offspring and young individuals follow their mother for several months after weaning (Ito 2003, Ito <em>et al. </em>2005).</p>","Babirusa on the Togian Islands are susceptible to habitat loss due to forest clearance and forest fires, to disturbance by humans, occasional hunting by the local people if perceived as a threat to crops and predation by dogs (Ito <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Akbar <em>et al</em>. 2007, M. Ito pers. comm. 2008). Hunting for food only occurs in a few non-Muslim village communities. In 1998 two thirds of Malenge Island’s forest was damaged by fire (due to annual climatic variation).

Recent estimation from questionnaires showed local residents did not provide agreement on population size (ranges from 100 to &gt;1,000), but the interview surveys did suggest that at least between 1995 and 2000 there had not been a sharp population decline (Akbar <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; During a questionnaire survey conducted in 2007, 39.9% of respondents reported a decrease in Babirusa numbers and estimated the population on Malenge Island at less than 100 individuals (Ito 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Babyrousa togeanensis </em>is confined to the Togian Archipelago in Indonesia, in the Gulf of Tomini between the northern and eastern Sulawesi peninsulas (Macdonald 1993).

This range is becoming increasingly fragmented and the area of  available suitable habitat is decreasing (Velazquez 1994, Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2016, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018, Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em>  2018). This rabbit is being threatened by competition with grazing  livestock, increasing frequency of fire, intrusion by humans  (settlements, roads, etc.), and climate change. Models extrapolating its  persistence in a metapopulation context under climate change indicate  that it is likely to be severely impacted (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2009).  Its current EOO is 2,469 km², and an overestimate of the AOO is &lt;444  km² (based on the sum of 19 relatively large habitat polygons, in which  the species is further fragmented). The high level of current  fragmentation and the multitude of ongoing threats are likely to lead to  further decreases in area occupied. Thus, the Volcano Rabbit qualifies  for Endangered status (EN B1ab(i,ii,iii,v) + B2ab(i,ii,iii,v)).<br/><br/>Reports  that the Volcano Rabbit has gone extinct in the vicinity of the Nevado  de Toluca (Mexico Daily News 2018) are false. Native populations of the  Volcano Rabbit have never been in the Nevado de Toluca. A colony was  introduced in the 1970s and sometime later a single individual was  captured and taken into captivity, since then there have been no  verified records of the species in this area. The Nevado de Toluca is  not included in the current distribution map for the species.","The Volcano Rabbit is a habitat specialist (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993, Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em>  2018, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). It is found at its highest  density in a subalpine habitat containing bunchgrass (“zacaton”) and  pine communities (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993, Hunter and Cresswell 2015, Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>  2015). The largest remaining area of preferred habitat resides in the  Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park, between 3,400 and 4,200 m  (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). A study conducted on the Iztaccihuatl  volcano found that preference was shown for areas that had low  occurrence of “closed forest, long grass, cattle grazing, hunting, bare  ground and incline” (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). Contrary to previous  findings, the study suggested that an increase of recent fire activity  resulted in increased abundance of the rabbit, resulting from improved  habitat quality from reduced competition to bunchgrass (Hunter and  Cresswell 2015). However, regular use of fire to benefit cattle grazing  is not recommended given that cattle grazing proved to be more  detrimental to the Volcano Rabbit than the benefit of improved habitat  quality (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). Further, prevalence of fire led to a  decrease in population persistence (VORTEX modeling, Portales <em>et al.</em>  1997). A second study in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountain Range found  that, in addition to the previously mentioned factors, proximity to  highways and population centers had a negative impact on abundance,  although this study did not find a correlation with regard to slope (the  effect of fire was not examined) (Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Until  today, habitat fragmentation has not resulted in the loss of genetic  variability, nor has it affected the genetic structure of Volcano Rabbit  populations. The values of genetic diversity are similar in populations  that live in a connected landscape and those that live in an  unconnected one. In addition, gene flow has been detected even in  isolated populations (Montes-Carreto <em>et al.</em>, in press).<br/><br/>The  diet of the Volcano Rabbit is diverse. It is known to consume more than  70 plant species, although the rabbits consume with greater frequency  zacatonales of the genera Muhlenbergia, Festuca, and Jarava (Cervantes  and Martínez 1992, Martínez-García <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mancines-Arellano  2017). In areas where bunchgrass is less abundant, they give birth in  cracks and abandoned burrows (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993). It is  unlikely that the Volcano Rabbit constructs burrows of its own (Fa and  Bell 1990). Gestation time for this species is 38-40 days (Cervantes <em>et al.</em>  1990). It may be reproductively active year-round with a peak breeding  season occurring ""during the warm, rainy summer"" (Cervantes <em>et al.</em>  1990). Litter size is one to three (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).  Adults in a captive breeding program weighed 400-600 g, with birth  weights for females 25-27 g and males 32 g (Matsuzaki <em>et al.</em>  1982). Total length of newborns ranges from 8.3-10.6 cm (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990). Mean total length of adults range between 26.8-32.0 (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990). Most activity occurs in the morning and late afternoon (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>A  study conducted in the Itxa-Popo National Park found that the Volcano  Rabbit makes up 12.5% and 5.5% of the prey base for the Bobcat (<em>Lynx  rufus</em>) and Coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>), respectively (Garcia <em>et al.</em>  2014). Additional predators include the Long-tailed Weasel (<em>Mustela  frenata</em>), Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>), and rattlesnakes  (<em>Crotalus </em>spp.) (Cervantes-Reza 1981, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).","The Volcano Rabbit is threatened by habitat destruction, caused by  livestock grazing, agriculture and property development encroachment,  logging, harvest of the “zacaton” grasses, and fires (98% of which are  started by humans attempting to encourage new pasture growth) (Fa and  Bell 1990). Its range is within 45 minutes of one of the world’s largest  cities (Mexico City) and urban expansion has resulted in habitat loss  (Fa and Bell 1990), which is ongoing. Today, suitable habitat for the  Volcano Rabbit in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountains covers 7,544 ha,  equivalent to only 13.68% of the landscape, including 957 patches: 293  have a minimum area of 0.25 ha and only two are larger than 1,000 ha  (Uriostegui-Velarde et al 2018). Though hunting is illegal, it continues  because of lack of local knowledge of its protected status, and lack of  enforcement (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>Reduction  of habitat quality associated to the presence of pasture lands, crops,  and roads may have a stressful effect on the rabbits, as mean cortisol  metabolites levels measured in its faeces were more than two times  higher in highly degraded habitat compared to the low degraded habitat  (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species. Anderson <em>et al.</em>  (2009) predicted that the lower elevation range limit of the Volcano  Rabbit may shift upslope by approximately 700 m during the next 100  years, which will reduce the area occupied by the species, as the  mountain peaks currently lack suitable habitat.","An early estimate of the population of the Volcano Rabbit was 7,085  rabbits; 1,811 individuals in Pelado, 1,816 in Tlaloc, 3,458 in  Izta-Popo and approximately 3,056 for the surrounding areas (Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997). Due to a variety of continuous and ongoing threats, its population is likely to be lower at the present time.<br/><br/>Population  densities estimated by line transects are variable between regions.  Studies conducted on the Pelado Volcano indicated that densities ranged  from 0.11 to 1.2 rabbits/ha according to habitat characteristics  (Velázquez 1994); in the Biological Corredor Chichinautzin the density  was estimated to be 4.2 individuals/ha (Rizo-Aguilar <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). Other studies have shown the relative abundance based on fecal  pellet counts is also highly variable throughout its distribution,  ranging from 0.1 to 3.1 latrines/m² in habitat on the Volcano Pelado  (Velázquez 1994, Velázquez and Heil 1996), and 0.02 to 0.12 latrines/m²  in Sierra Chichinautzin (Rizo-Aguilar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>The  only study that has monitored trends in population was conducted in a  core population in the Sierra Chichinautzin based on density estimates  using pellet counts (Guerrero <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). This study  indicated that Volcano Rabbit density declined from 4.2 individuals/ha  in 2011 to &lt;1 individual/ha in 2017.<br/><br/>Initial studies indicated  that the Volcano Rabbit occupied fragmented habitat, and that there  were 16 discrete occupied habitat fragments (Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em>  1997); the current number of isolated habitat polygons is 19. More  recent evaluation of the degree of fragmentation within occupied habitat  polygons was able to discern significantly more fine-scale Volcano  Rabbit habitat fragmentation (Uriostegui-Velarde <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).  At the landscape level 957 patches of available habitat covering 75.44  km² were identified along the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountain Range (thus  encompassing Tlaloc Volcano, Pelado Volcano, and Coajomulco forests),  most (N = 293) of which had a minimum area of 2,500 m². Only two patches  were larger than 1,000 ha. 144 plots were sampled intensively, and of  these 50 contained no evidence of Volcano Rabbit presence (no latrines  were located); on only five plots were there more than 100 latrines,  indicating the presence of a highly viable population  (Uriostegui-Velarde <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).",Decreasing,"The Volcano Rabbit is endemic to Mexico, restricted to the Transverse  Neovolcanic Belt, mainly in discontinuous patches on four volcanoes  (Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl, El Pelado, Tlaloc) and the Sierra  Chichinautzin (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>2016, Velázquez and  Gopar-Merino 2018). An initial estimate of area of occupancy (AOO) was approximately 386 km²  based on occupancy on the four volcanoes (Velazquez 1994), although  this area has subsequently been reduced to 335 km². Recent observations,  based on latrine records and sightings in the Biological Corridor  Chichinautzin, have added 109 km² to this distribution (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>  2016). A recent survey in the Parque Ecoturístico Piedra Canteada,  along the Tlaxcala/Puebla border, north of Iztaccihuatl, yielded a  recent siting of Volcano Rabbits, but the extent is unknown  (Ramírez-Albores <em>et al.</em>2014). As a result of the over 15 years  continuous volcanic activity of the Popocatepetl Volcano, the  distribution range has shifted and expanded, locally. Currently, the  discontinuous EOO is 2,469 km². The whole range, however, is becoming  increasingly fragmented as a result of human-induced and natural causes  (Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2018, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>The Volcano Rabbit occurs between 2,900 m and 4,250 m in elevation (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016), but its highest density is found between 3,150 m and 3,400 m (Velazquez 1994).","In some areas, this species is hunted for food.",Terrestrial,"The Volcano Rabbit is listed under Appendix I of CITES (1973), although  the species has never been involved in international trade and this  listing is apparently an historical artifact. Hunting is illegal  according to Mexican law, but poorly enforced (Fa and Bell 1990,  Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). It is listed as endangered in the  Mexican Official Norm NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (SEMARNAT 2010). It occurs  within the protected areas Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks, but  hunting, grazing, and grass burning persist within the park boundaries  (Cervantes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>Captive  breeding programs have been established with some success, but infant  mortality in captivity is very high (Fa and Bell 1990).<br/><br/>It is  recommended that conservation measures focus on habitat management,  particularly the control of burning and overgrazing of the bunchgrass  “zacaton” habitat, and enforcement of the existing laws prohibiting  hunting and trade of the Volcano Rabbit (Fa and Bell 1990, Hunter and  Cresswell 2015, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). Management of the  protected areas should be improved and education plans at local,  national, and international levels should be implemented (Fa and Bell  1990, Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Hunter and Cresswell 2015,  Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).

The species does not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and should be listed as Least Concern. However, the Peruvian subspecies is much less abundant (about 21,000 total) and the IUCN Pinniped Specialist Group has listed it as Vulnerable.","South American Fur Seals are sexually dimorphic. Adult males are approximately 1.3 times longer and 3.3 times heavier than adult females. Adult males can reach 2 m and 90–160 kg, and possibly 200 kg; females do not exceed 1.5 m long and weigh on average 60 kg. Males of the Peruvian subspecies are smaller than the South American subspecies and females are slightly larger (Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, 2008a). Newborns are 50-65 cm and 3-7.5 kg (Vaz-Ferreira 1982, Punta San Juan Program unpublished data), with initial mass being significantly greater for male pups (Baladán Corbo 2012). Females reach their maximum reproductive value at 3-5 years old (Lima and Páez 1995, 1997). Their reproductive cycle has a duration of 11 months, with a 3-4 month embryonic diapause (Vaz Ferreira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1982, Katz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Breeding takes place from late October through mid January (Majluf 1987a, Franco-Trecu 2005). Pupping peaks in mid November to mid December, and mating occurs 1-6 days after the female gives birth (Franco-Trecu 2005, Pavés and Schlatter 2008). Following birth, the mother suckles her pup and fasts on shore for almost 11 days (Franco-Trecu 2010). Then the female begins to make foraging trips punctuated by time attending the pup ashore, spending up to 4-5 days foraging at sea and 1-2 days feeding offspring at rookeries (Bastida and Rodriguez 2003). During the first three months of maternal care, duration of foraging trips by females is highly variable, which affects the survival of offspring since longer trips increase pup mortality (Franco-Trecu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010b).<br/><br/>Time spent on feeding trips and attending offspring likely varies with location, changes in marine productivity, and age of offspring, or a combination of these factors. Trip distances, trip durations and lengths of visits increase throughout the season. During the early lactation females perform short nocturnal foraging trips. Trip duration starts increasing during mid-lactation, but the majority of foraging effort still concentrates close to breeding sites. Later in the season, when pups are capable of withstanding longer fasts and metabolic demands of pregnancy and lactation are higher, females may stay at sea longer and forage in more distant prey patches (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). In the Atlantic, the effects of El Niño-La Niña are less strong. Within the usual variability, the differences between years are relatively minor and the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are relatively moderate. In the absence of drastic changes in the ecosystem, attendance patterns are not affected (Franco-Trecu 2010).<br/><br/>Colonies are generally found along rocky coasts, on ledges above the shoreline or in boulder strewn areas. Most areas utilized have some source of shade such as at the base of cliffs or under boulders, and easy access to the ocean or tidal pools (Stevens and Boness 2003). Around midday, Fur Seals make daily movements from high and dry levels of the rookeries to cool off in low and wet areas or in the sea (Cassini 2001, Vaz-Ferreira and Ponce de León 1984). During the reproductive season, these movements can often cause female aggression towards conspecifics, mostly at other females, in order to protect their new-born pups and maximize their offspring’s survival (Cassini 2001).<br/><br/>Males are polygynous and territorial, and fighting can result in serious wounds and scars (Cappozzo 1995). The number of breeding females associated with a territorial male varies between 3-6 in southern Chile (Pavés and Schlatter 2008) and 6-20 at Punta San Juan (Majluf 1987a). The highest number of territorial males at the colonies can be found in late December, decreasing in January (Franco-Trecu 2005, Franco-Trecu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Individual bulls can occupy territories for up to 60 days (Cappozzo 1995) until most of the females are mated, and then they leave their territories to start foraging at sea (Pavés and Schlatter 2008). Only a few adult males out of the total population achieve mating, and a large proportion is excluded to peripheral or male exclusive areas. In Uruguay, the breeding pattern is a ""lek"" system where females have extensive home ranges that overlap with the small territories of many males. Females move freely in the colony and males do not monopolize access to females (Franco-Trecu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Most pup mortality take place at the beginning of the breeding season, during the peak of birthing (Franco-Trecu 2010). In general, the principal causes of death of South American Fur Seal pups are enteritis with microscopic lesions of bacteremia (associated with the presence of hookworms) (28%), and starvation, trauma, and drowning (63%) (Seguel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Locally, pup mortality is also caused by predation by adult male South American Sea Lions that can be significant at some colonies (Harcourt 1993). Maternal aggression was also recognized as an important source of mortality for Peruvian Fur Seals before the 1997-98 ENSO (Harcourt 1991,1992; Majluf 1992).<br/><br/>Based on satellite tracking data, South American Fur Seals apparently forage between 50 and 600 m with no clear water-depth preference, and mean duration of the female foraging trips during the breeding season is 126 hours (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Lactating females in Uruguay forage 41-185 km from the breeding sites (Vaz-Ferreira 1976, York <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998). For the Peruvian Fur Seal, ENSO years have a negative impact on animals and during those years females must spend much more time attempting to forage, which affects offspring growth and survival (Majluf 1987a, Gentry and Kooyman 1987). During the 1983 ENSO, adult female Peruvian Fur Seals showed mean dives to 29 m, with a maximum of 170 m and mean duration of 2.5 minutes and maximum of 7 minutes (Majluf 1987b). During the 1997 ENSO, adult females had to spend longer periods at sea foraging (10-20 days) causing their pups to die of starvation.<br/><br/>The location of foraging grounds almost certainly depends on the distribution of preferred prey (Laptikhovsky 2009). The foraging area of the South American Fur Seals southwest of the Falkland Islands coincides with the region of the highest abundance of the Lobster Krill (<em>Munida </em>spp.), the most important food resource of Fur Seals off the Falklands (Laptikhovsky 2009). Seasonal variations in intensity and position of both the Falkland Current and Argentine Drift could also be a reason for seasonal changes in female foraging grounds (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>The Southern Fur Seal diet varies according to prey availability. Although they are trophic generalists with the potential to prey upon many species, a few species dominate their diet. Pelagic and demersal fishes and cephalopods are the most common prey (Vásquez 1995; Zavalaga <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, Arias-Schreiber 2000, 2003; Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008b, Vallejos 2010, Franco-Trecu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, 2013, 2014).","Development of large and small scale commercial fisheries have a negligible effect on South American Fur Seals in the Atlantic due to the minimal overlap between Fur Seal prey items and target commercial species (Crespo pers. comm.). In contrast, industrial fishing along the coast of Peru may threaten the pelagic resources on which Fur Seals depend. Those fisheries started in the 1950s and 1960s, and contributed to several declines in biomass of Anchoveta which is a major prey of Fur Seals (Pauly and Palomares 1989, Pauly and Tsukayama 1987).<br/><br/>Mortality due to bycatch and interactions is known to occur occasionally in artisanal and other fisheries (Maijluf <em>et al.</em> 2002, Franco-Trecu <em>et al.</em> 2009, De Maria 2012, Sepúlveda pers. comm., Cárdenas-Alayza unpublished data). Incidental captures of Fur Seals in shark nets have been reported in Uruguay (Scialabba 1989, Franco-Trecu <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/><br/>During the 1970s and part of the 1980s, South American Fur Seals (and other wildlife) were hunted illegally in southern Chile and Argentina to bait traps set for Southern King Crab. Bait used between 1976 and 1980 was estimated as 200–400 tons per year (Cárdenas <em>et al.</em> 1987). Because this fishery is decreasing due to overexploitation, hunting pressure on the Fur Seal is being reduced. In Peru, Arias-Schreiber (1993) reported that it is common for some fishermen to kill and use pinnipeds as bait to catch saltwater Snails. However, the incidence of illegal Fur Seal catches and their impact on populations are not known. <br/><br/>The limited number of large, dense breeding aggregations could make this species particularly sensitive to the effects of oil spills and disease epidemics. Like other Fur Seals, South American Fur Seals are vulnerable to oil spills because of their dependence on their thick pelage for thermoregulation. In February 1997, 5,000 metric tons of crude oil were spilled from the vessel San Jorge onto on the coast of Isla de Lobos in southern Uruguay. Nearly 5,000 South American Fur Seal pups (2-3 months old) were heavily oiled and/or died (Mearns <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>With the breeding population located at a limited number of rookeries, human activities could have populations consequences if disturbance occurs (Cárdenas-Alayza 2012).","Available data on South American Fur Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the two recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>South American Fur Seal--99,000, trend increasing weakly; </li></ul><ul><li>Peruvian Fur Seal--10,500, trend unknown.&#160; <br/></li></ul>The figures indicate the total number of mature Southern Fur Seals is approximately 109,500, and 219,000 is a reasonable estimate of the total population size. Since the much more abundant South American subspecies is known to be increasing it is likely the species as a whole is increasing also.",Increasing,"The South American subspecies is distributed along the western South Atlantic (southern Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands), and eastern South Pacific (southern Chile) coasts. On the Atlantic side, haulouts can be found along the coasts of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil (approximately from 29º to 32º S) (Muelbert and Oliveira 2006, Oliveira 2013), although the northern limit for breeding colonies is at Islas del Castillo, Uruguay (34º21’S, 53º44’W). Throughout the coast of Argentina, breeding and non-breeding colonies continue to be found until Tierra del Fuego-Isla de los Estados at the extreme south, also including the Falkland Islands (Túnez <em>et al</em>. 2008, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2015). Their distribution continues all around the southern tip of South America to the Pacific side, to Isla Guafo in southern Chile (43º33’S, 74º51’W) (Oliveira 2004). <br/><br/>The Peruvian subspecies is distributed along the coast of Peru and northern Chile. In Peru they occur from Isla Mazorca (11° 20’S) to Ilo (17°42’S), with a small isolated colony occurring in northern Peru at Isla Foca (5°&#160;20’S) (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2012). At the southern limit of Peru, colonies continue on the north coast of Chile (from 17°- 2° S) (Torres 1985, Guerra and Torres 1987), although the distribution of this species in Chile is now expanding to the South, reaching to 29°S (Sepúlveda, pers. comm.). Thus, the majority of the breeding population occurs in Peru from 15° to 17°S.","Human subsistence hunting of South American Fur Seals undoubtedly began with first contact and continues today. Commercial exploitation began after the discovery of South American Fur Seals by Europeans in the 18th century. As an example, in 1775 the ship States from Boston, loaded 13,500 skins from the Falkland Islands area (Bonner 1982). A managed harvest was conducted in Uruguay, and between 1965 and 1991 (when harvesting ceased) 234,000 Fur Seals were harvested. Harvest levels generally declined in the 20th century bringing about the cessation of hunting at many locations (Ximenez and Languth 2002). In Peru, commercial harvests are believed to have reduced Fur Seal numbers to the point that it was thought that few, if any, Fur Seals were left by the late 20th Century (Majluf and Trillmich 1981, Muck and Fuentes 1987). That led to the banning of all sealing in 1959, and population numbers increased following protection.",Terrestrial|Marine,"South American Fur Seals are protected and managed by laws in most of the countries where they occur. In Peru it is illegal to poach, export, or transport Fur Seals for commercial purposes (Decreto Supremo No. 013-99-AG). The catastrophic decline that followed the 1997-1998 ENSO led to South American Fur Seals being categorized as in danger of extinction in Peru (Decreto Supremo No. 034-2004-AG), and this decree was recently revised and Fur Seals remain in the same category (Decreto Supremo No. 004-2014-MINAGRI). In Chile, the status of total protection was given to all <em>Arctocephalus </em>species in 1978 (Torres 1987, Reijnders <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993), and in 1995 the protection was extended for 30 years (Decreto Supremo No. 225-Subsecretaría de Pesca; Sielfeld 1999). In Argentina, marine mammals are under the administration of the provinces. At the Falkland Islands, Fur Seals are protected by British law. In Brazil, all the pinniped species have been protected by law since 1986 (Portaria SUDEPE n0 N-11, de 21-02-1986) and also by the National Action Plans for Conservation of Brazilian Aquatic Mammals (IBAMA 2001, Rocha-Campos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). In Uruguay, the South American Fur Seal was named as a focal object of conservation in the Marine Protected Area of Cabo Polonio by the National System of Protected Areas. South American Fur Seals have also been afforded protection by the establishment of numerous reserves and marine protected areas, including privately owned sites.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The number of mature individuals in the entire population in 2011 was 632, a reduction of 20.4% from the 795 mature individuals in 1983. Currently the species is still in overall decline with two distinct trajectories between the populations in the NWHI (4.0% per year decline) and the MHI (6.5% per year increase; Caretta <em>et al</em>. 2013). The NWHI decline is mainly due to food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators. The overall decline of more than 20% within two generations (30 years) meets IUCN criterion C1 for Endangered.<br/></p>      <em></em>","Adult Hawaiian Monk Seals reach lengths of about 2.1 to 2.4 m and weigh 170-240 kg. Pups are about 1 m and 16-18 kg at birth and when weaned six weeks later they weigh 50-100 kg (Kenyon 1981, Antonelis <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Female Monk Seals first give birth at 4-10 years old. Births occur during all months of the year, with most occurring during March to August (Johanos <em>et al</em>. 1994). Age specific fecundity rates for mature animals range from 50% to over 80%, and differ among subpopulations (Harting <em>et al</em>. 2007, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011). Males in this polygynous species patrol the water adjacent to rookeries or land near females with pups. Male dominated sex ratios have occurred at some colonies, and that has resulted in mobbing of oestrus females some of which have been severely injured or killed in such events (Johanos <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Monk seals are generally solitary, both on land and at sea. Even when seals gather together on land, they are not normally gregarious and only mothers and pups and recently weaned seals regularly make physical contact. On land, Hawaiian Monk Seals haul-out and breed on substrates of sand, coral, or volcanic rock. Sandy beaches with shallow protected water near shore appear to be preferred for pupping (Westlake and Gilmartin 1990).<br/><br/>At-sea movements and habitat use of Hawaiian Monk Seals have been investigated using satellite-linked dive recorders and animal-borne video cameras. In the NWHI, Monk Seals forage within atolls, in the shallow waters surrounding atolls and islands, and farther offshore at submerged banks and reefs (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the MHI, Monk Seals tend to stay within 50 km of shore and forage almost entirely within the 200 m bathymetric contour of the islands. Seals carrying cameras in both regions searched for and preyed on benthic fish and invertebrates in coral reefs, sand flats, as well as areas of rubble and consolidated bottom material, along areas of transition of benthic habitat types, and also in deepwater coral beds (Parish <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2002; NMFS unpublished data). Most dives that have been recorded have been less than 150 meters deep, although some individuals dived to more than 550 m (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2006, NMFS unpublished data). Hawaiian Monk Seals are known to eat a variety of fishes, eels, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Goodman-Lowe 1998, Iverson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cahoon <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Recovery of Hawaiian Monk Seals has been affected to an unknown degree by disturbance from military activities in the NWHI including the alteration, development, and occupation of bases on several key islands that started before World War II (Ragen and Lavigne 1999). However, the military no longer has bases in the area and the vast majority of Monk Seals live where they are isolated from most direct human contact. The only permanent structures remaining in the NWHI are US Fish and Wildlife Service facilities at Tern Island and Midway Atoll, and remnants of former Coast Guard facilities at Kure Atoll. Degradation of these structures, particularly at Tern Island, poses a significant entrapment hazard for Monk Seals. There are also concerns about legacy chemicals and contaminants that were left behind.<br/><br/>Current threats to Monk Seals are thoroughly reviewed and analysed in National Marine Fisheries Service (2007). The most crucial threats in the NWHI at this time are: 1) food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators; 2) entanglement in marine debris, largely fragments of net and line discarded by North Pacific fisheries; 3) predation by sharks, especially on pre-weaned and recently weaned pups; and 4) intraspecific aggression by sub-dominant males. An emerging threat in this region may be the loss of terrestrial habitat due to sea level increases resulting from global warming (Baker et al. 2006). The situation in the MHI is different, with the main threats there being: 1) interactions with commercial and non-commercial fishing gear especially hookings and entanglements in gillnets; 2) possible transmission of diseases from feral animals, domestic pets, and livestock to seals; and 3) intentional killing and harassment.","Hawaiian Monk Seals are distributed throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago. Within the Monk Seal’s range, two regions are often distinguished: the NWHI, comprising eight subpopulations located on remote atolls and small islands, and the MHI, comprising eight large high islands and associated small islets. Seals in the MHI are considered to be a single subpopulation. The status of the Hawaiian Monk Seal is assessed annually and updated by the US National Marine Fisheries Service’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. The most recent reliable abundance estimates, from 2011, were used for this assessment.<br/><br/>The generation time for Hawaiian Monk Seals, estimated as the average age of reproducing individuals, is approximately 15 years. The best estimate of the total number of seals of all age classes in 2011 is 1,209. The population is comprised of approximately 632 sexually mature seals with the following distribution across subpopulations: Kure Atoll 58, Midway Atoll 27, Pearl and Hermes Reef 101, Lisianski Island 77, Laysan Island 113, French Frigate Shoals 117,&#160; Necker Island 38, Nihoa Island 43, and the MHI 58 (NMFS unpublished data). <br/><br/>The earliest information on Monk Seal abundance comes from 1958 (Kenyon and Rice 1959, Rice 1960). However, those data consisted of beach counts only and did not include an estimate of total population size. In order to compare total abundance over time, we have used an estimate for NWHI abundance in 1983 (Gerrodette 1985) at which time there were negligible numbers of seals known to exist in the MHI. This number is compared to the 2011 estimate for total abundance for both the NWHI and MHI. The total abundance estimate for 1983 was 1,520. In 2011, total range-wide abundance was estimated to be 1,209. Over this 28 year period the number of mature individuals declined by 20.4%, from 795 to 632. Extrapolating this decline pattern across two generations (30 years: 1984-2014) gives an estimated overall decline of 21.8%.<br/><br/>Overall, the Monk Seal population is still in decline, but with two distinct trajectories between the populations in the NWHI (4.0% per year decline) and the MHI (6.5% per year increase; Caretta <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is expected that species will continue to decline for at least the next 12 years if trends remain the same. At that point the number of animals in the MHI will surpass that in the NWHI and growth in the MHI will offset losses in the NWHI (NMFS unpublished data).",Decreasing,"Hawaiian Monk Seals occur throughout the Hawaiian Island chain. Their six main reproductive sites are in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) at Kure Atoll, Midway Atoll, Pearl and Hermes Reef, Lisianski Island, Laysan Island, and French Frigate Shoals (National Marine Fisheries Service 2007). While sightings were previously rare in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), Monk Seals are now regularly seen there and births have been documented on all of the major islands (Baker and Johanos 2004). Sightings outside of the main range have occurred at Johnston Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island (Ragen and Lavigne 1999).<br/><br/>Hawaiian Monk Seals are non-migratory, and tend to remain near the atoll where they were born. However, approximately 10% of seals will relocate temporarily or permanently to other sites in the island chain, and long distance wanderers have been recorded.<br/><br/>There are approximately 1,693 km of coastline habitat for Monk Seals in Hawaii (US Census Bureau 2012). However, the terrestrial habitat available for their use in the NWHI is very limited. The total area of emergent land is only about 13.5 km² and only a fraction of that is suitable for use by seals (Ragen and Lavigne 1999).<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for Hawaiian Monk seals is approximately 1,500,000 km² and the area of occupancy is approximately 293,000 km².<br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"The Hawaiian Monk Seal has been listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act since 1976. That law contains a number of provisions to protect the seals and their critical habitat. They are also covered by a general prohibition against unpermitted taking by the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1973.<br/><br/>Virtually all of the land and waters in the NWHI is included in one or more protected areas (the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands State Marine Refuge, the Kure Atoll State Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument) where human activities that could effect the seals or their habitats are either prohibited or strictly controlled.<br/><br/>Hawaiian Monk Seals are the focus of one of the most proactive marine mammal recovery programs in the world (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2011). Historically, the primary focus of the species’ recovery program was to increase survival of juvenile and adult female seals in the NWHI. Important recovery efforts include: 1) cleaning up of marine debris and toxic chemicals; 2) minimizing human activities that could disturb seals hauled out on beaches; 3) mitigation of shark predation of young pups through limited shark removals or pup translocations; 4) removal and translocation of adult males to mitigate mortality associated with male aggression towards juveniles and females; and 5) regulating fisheries to reduce the likelihood of direct and indirect interactions. In spite of these efforts the population has continued to decline, however, the efforts have mitigated some of the severity of that decline.&#160; A recent analysis has shown that up to 30% of the current Monk Seal population is alive today due to the small-scale mitigation efforts targeted towards individual seals over the past 30 years (Harting <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>Efforts to increase juvenile survival are also being expanded using a variety of translocation strategies. Over the past thirty years, numerous Monk Seal translocations have been conducted with a variety of objectives, including reducing shark predation and conspecific male aggression, stopping human–seal interactions, and taking advantage of different demographic patterns between subpopulations to improve survival. (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014).<br/><br/>Management agencies are currently developing a vaccination plan to guard against a disease outbreak that could decimate the population. Two viruses, <em>Morbillivirus</em> and West Nile Virus, have been identified as infectious agents with a high risk to Hawaiian Monk Seals. Marine <em>Morbillivirus</em> strains have been recently identified in Hawaii and it considered only a matter of time before West Nile Virus makes it to Hawaii (Kilpatrick <em>et al</em>. 2004, West <em>et al</em>. 2013). Background surveys conducted on Hawaiian Monk Seals show that they remain naïve (no detectable antibodies) to both viruses. The vaccination program could begin as early as 2015.<br/><br/>In 2014, a privately funded and managed rehabilitation facility was constructed to support recovery efforts.&#160; This Hawaiian Monk Seal hospital will serve to care for seals from across the archipelago that are sick, injured, emaciated, or otherwise in need of rehabilitation.<br/><br/>With the increase of Monk Seals in the main Hawaiian Islands, the recovery program has had to develop a number of strategies to maintain population growth while mitigating human-seal interactions (Lowry et al. 2011).&#160; The program is currently working on strategies to prevent and modify unwanted seal behaviors including fisheries interactions and animals conditioned to interact with people.&#160; A significant component of this work includes community engagement on how to avoid negative wildlife interactions.",Oceanian,,false,false,Global
45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry. The “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Pacific Walruses by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a quota is determined annually. Russian legislation prohibits sport hunting of Pacific Walruses, and a variety of types of protection are afforded to major haulout sites along the Russian coast (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45229114,17013,Phoca vitulina,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Harbor Seals are distributed very widely and their total population size is estimated at about 600,000. Trend in abundance is unknown for four of the subspecies; the Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal is known to be increasing. While in many areas Harbor Seals share the coastal zone with increasing human populations and suffer some impacts as a result, current threats appear to be tolerable and/or manageable. As a species, the Harbor Seal does not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and is listed as Least Concern. However, the subspecies <em>Phoca vitulina mellonae</em>, the Ungava Seal, is listed separately as Endangered.","Harbor Seals live mostly in the coastal waters of the continental shelf and slope, and are commonly found in bays, rivers, estuaries, and intertidal areas. They also occur in some lakes (Burns 2009). They will haul out on rocks, sand and shingle beaches, sand bars, mud flats, vegetation, sea ice, glacial ice and a variety of man-made structures. They usually lie close to the water to permit a rapid escape from threats. Sex and age segregation is common in most populations (Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). They are usually extremely wary and shy on land and therefore it is almost impossible to approach them when they are hauled out without stampeding them into the water. However, habituation to human activities in their vicinity can occur. Most haul-out sites are used daily, based on tidal cycles and other environmental variables, although foraging trips can last for several days (Grellier <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Although Harbor Seals are considered a non-migratory species with a high degree of site fidelity to a haul out, long-distance dispersal of juveniles, emigration, and establishment of new haul out sites do occur (Ries <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Bjorge <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). There is also evidence of seasonal changes in at-sea distribution and home range size by age class and sex (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Dietz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Adult male Harbor Seals are 1.6-1.9 m long and weigh 70-150 kg, adult females are 1.5-1.7 m and 60-110 kg. At birth, pups are 82-98 cm and 8-12 kg (Burns 2009). Males become sexually mature when four to six years old. Female Harbor Seals usually become sexually mature when three to five years old (Harkonen and Heide-Jorgensen 1990). Throughout the Harbor Seal's range, the time of birthing varies widely and may follow a latitudinal cline (Temte 1994). Peak pupping date varies from mid March to early September. The mating system is promiscuous, or weakly polygynous, with males defending underwater calling sites (Boness <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Van Parijs and Kovacs 2002). Mating usually takes place in the water, with females coming into oestrus about a month after giving birth. Molt follows the pupping and mating season. The timing of onset of molt depends on the age and sex of the animal with yearlings molting first and adult males last (Reder <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). <br/><br/>Females give birth to a single precocial pup. Most pups shed their silvery gray lanugo coat in the uterus before birth and are born with a juvenile pelage. Exceptions to this include pups born prematurely, and some that are born early in the breeding season (Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994). Pups usually enter the water soon after birth, and because of tidal inundation at many sites used for birthing, this often occurs within hours (Burns 2009). Pups are suckled for an average of 26 days (Drescher 1979). Unlike Grey Seals, Harbor Seal females need to feed during the lactation period to produce adequate milk for their rapidly growing pup, and as a result they undertake regular feeding trips to sea (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994, Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001).<br/><br/>At sea, Harbor Seals are most often seen alone, but they occasionally occur in small groups. Localized aggregations can form in response to feeding opportunities and concentration of prey. Harbor Seals are generalist feeders that take a wide variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans obtained from surface, mid-water, and benthic habitats (e.g., Pitcher 1980, Harkonen 1987, Olesiuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Pierce <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991). Their diet is highly varied, and animals from different populations and areas show differences, and there is also variation associated with seasonal and interannual changes in the abundance of prey (e.g., Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996). Generally, a few species dominate the diet at any one location and time of year. They are primarily a coastal species with dive depths generally less than 100 m (Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998), but dives to as much as 480 m have been recorded in Alaska (Frost <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). <br/><br/>Longevity is about 30-35 years with females living longer than males. Known predators include Killer Whales, Great White and Greenland Sharks, and possibly other Shark species, Steller Sea Lions, Walrus, Eagles, Gulls, and Ravens (Burns 2009).","Historically, there have been organized population reduction programs and bounty schemes for Harbor Seals in some range states, largely because of perceived competition with fisheries. Hunting and/or licensed killing to protect fisheries has largely been eliminated but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives is allowed in the US. In the eastern Atlantic, Harbor Seal population reduction programs date from the early 1980s and 1990s in Iceland and Scotland, respectively (Bowen and Lidgard 2012) and continue at some level today (e.g., Butler <em>et al.</em> 2008). An extermination program at the beginning of the 20th century dramatically depleted Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea. Quotas for Harbor Seals are set annually in Norway and a bounty is paid to hunters in several regions of the country.<br/><br/>Mass die-offs from viral outbreaks have killed thousands of Harbor Seals on both sides of the Atlantic, but most notably in Europe caused by phocine distemper virus (Dietz <em>et al.</em> 1989, Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2006, Reijnders 1986). Because Harbor Seals haul out on nearshore and coastal mainland sites, they are exposed to terrestrial wild carnivores, pets and feral animals, and waste from human populations that create an increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases. <br/><br/>Because many Harbor Seals live and feed in close proximity to large populations of humans they are exposed to, and can accumulate, high levels of industrial and agricultural pollutants (e.g., organochlorines, PCBs, dioxins) that negatively affect reproduction (Reijnders 1986), induce vitamin deficiency (Brouwer <em>et al.</em> 1989), and cause immunosuppression (Ross <em>et al.</em> 1995). Both chronic oil spills and discharges and episodic large-scale spills can cause direct mortality (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999; Hoover-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2001) and could have long term impacts on Harbor Seal health and their environment. <br/><br/>Noise and other disturbance from offshore oil and gas, and the development of offshore renewable energy such as wind farms, may also affect the foraging behavior and physical condition of Harbor Seals (Hastie <em>et al.</em> 2015, Skeate <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Harbor Seals live in coastal areas many of which are heavily fished and this results in entanglement and bycatch issues (see Desportes <em>et al.</em> 2010) Overfishing and environmental variability (including global climate change) may also impact Harbor Seal prey populations.","Available data on Harbor Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies.<br/>Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal--65,000, trend unknown</li><li>Western Atlantic Harbor Seal--60,000, trend unknown</li><li>Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal--170,000, increasing</li><li>Kuril Seal--&lt;10,000, trend unknown</li><li>Ungava Seal--50, trend unknown</li></ul>Combining those estimates, the total number of mature Harbor Seals worldwide is about 315,000. Bjorge <em>et al</em>. (2010) estimated the total worldwide population of Harbor Seals as approximately 610,000-640,000. The overall trend in numbers is unknown.",Unknown,"Harbor Seals are one of the most widespread of the pinnipeds. They are found throughout coastal waters of the northern hemisphere, from temperate to polar regions. Five subspecies are recognized:&#160;the Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Brittany to the Barents Sea in northwestern Russia and north to Svalbard, with occasional sightings as far south as northern Portugal,&#160;the Western Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the western Atlantic from the mid-Atlantic United States to the Canadian Arctic and east to Greenland and Iceland,&#160;the Ungava Seal&#160;only lives in a few lakes and rivers in northern Quebec, Canada, that drain into Hudson and James Bays,&#160;the&#160;Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal&#160;is found in the eastern Pacific from central Baja California, Mexico to the end of the Alaskan Peninsula and possibly to the eastern Aleutian Islands, and&#160;the Kuril Seal&#160;ranges from either the end of the Alaskan Peninsula or the eastern Aleutians to the Commander Islands, Kamchatka, and through the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido (Rice 1998).","Harbor Seals were commercially harvested in British Columbia, and commercial and recreational use also occurred in Alaska. All commercial harvesting ceased several decades ago. Harbor Seals were protected in Canada in 1970 by the Fisheries Act. The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 provided a broad prohibition on taking of any marine mammal. However, Alaska Natives are allowed to harvest Harbor Seals for subsistence and creation of authentic handicrafts, and Native handicrafts and edible portions may be sold in Native villages and towns. Some subsistence harvesting still occurs in Alaska, as well as in Canada and Greenland. In Russia, Kuril Seals are listed in the Red Data Book and there is no legal harvest.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Harbor seals at Svalbard are protected under the Norwegian National Red List. Hunting of Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea was prohibited in 1970 and management of this species in the Baltic Sea and Southern Scandinavian waters is the responsibility of HELCOM. Denmark and Sweden have established Harbor Seal sanctuaries. Neighboring states of the Wadden Sea have signed a trilateral agreement for the management of Harbor Seals. Since 1994, Harbor Seals have been considered vulnerable on the French national Red List. In the United Kingdom, Harbor Seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and the Marine Scotland Act.<br/><br/>In the United States the Harbor Seal is protected from all but Alaska Native subsistence hunting by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also prohibits importation of parts or products from all seals. In Canada, the management of Seals is regulated within the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans though the Fisheries Act and the Marine Mammal Regulations of 1993. Ungava Seals are being considered for designation as “Endangered” by COSEWIC and are listed as “Schedule 3, Special Concern” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act.

Average body length reaches 126-129 cm, with a maximum body length of approximately 140 cm (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Both sexes become sexually mature at about 6 years of age, with most breeding females (74% in a 1974 sample) aged between 8 and 17 years (Popov 1979, 1982). The pregnancy rate for females older than 9 is reported to be as low as 0.2-0.33 (Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Miyazaki 2002), and Krylov (1990) reports a similar low rate of 0.34 for females aged 10-14 years. Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), acknowledge that the reproductive rate is low in females &gt;20 years old, but suggest that the reproductive rate is &gt;0.5 for females &lt;20 years old taken together as a group. Since females &lt;20 years old make up approximately two-thirds of the population of adult females, they probably drive the overall reproductive rate for the population up to about 0.5. Both Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1999) and Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) attribute the lower reproductive rates of older females to the effect of long term exposure to organochlorine contaminants in the older animals. Accumulation of contaminants with age has been documented in Caspian seals, but most animals appear to be below thresholds associated with reproductive pathologies (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Pups are generally born from mid-January to late February on the ice, with a birth weight of around 5 kg (Popov 1979), and are nursed for 4-5 weeks. In contrast to ringed seals, females do not usually construct lairs (Frost and Lowry 1981), possibly because sufficient amounts of snow overlying the ice are normally lacking. Pupping on the ice without lairs has allowed direct counts of pups to be made in the recent aerial surveys (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pups do not enter the water until the ice melts in mid to late March.<br/><br/>The first documented observations of small numbers of Seals breeding in other parts of the Caspian were made in 1982, with females reported pupping on small sand islands in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, although it is likely this behaviour was not new (Krylov 1990). Large numbers of mostly nonbreeding Seals spend the winter in the middle and southern Caspian, with one estimate of 15,000 Seals along the Turkmenistan coast (Krylov 1990).<br/><br/>A post-breeding moult occurs from April to early May, during which the Seals first use the ice and then islands, sand bars, and reed beds for hauling out (Badamshin 1970, Krylov 1990). Presently, Komsomolets Bay and the Durnev Islands in Kazakhstan and Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj island in Russian waters represent the most important moulting habitats (Dmitrieva 2013). Aggregations of several tens of thousands of individuals can be found in Komsomoletz Bay during this period, and around ten thousand at Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj.<br/><br/>During late spring, summer, and early autumn, Caspian Seals are distributed throughout the Caspian Sea. They feed throughout the region, exploiting both the shallow basin in the north and the deep middle and southern basins (Krylov 1990). Recent satellite telemetry studies indicate about 60% of animals move to the middle and southern Caspian, with the remainder staying in the north, primarily around the inflow of Volga and Ural rivers (Dmitrieva 2013). The telemetry studies suggest considerable individual variation in summer migratory and foraging behavior, with individuals spending the summer period separated among shallow, intermediate, and deep water locations. This may reflect individual specialization or niche partitioning in relation to habitat or prey types (Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015a). <br/><br/>During the post-moult summer period Seals rarely haul out, spending several months at sea feeding. In late autumn the breeding adults gather in the northeast, hauling out on sandy islands and reed beds in increasing numbers until ice begins to form (Krylov 1990). When the surface freezes over, females form aggregations on the ice to give birth to their pups, tending to gather along cracks in the ice giving them ready access to the water, although like Ringed Seals they also construct and maintain holes in the ice for water access (Heptner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Diving capacity for Caspian Seals is comparable to other small phocids, with maximum dive depths exceeding 200 m and dive times exceeding 20 minutes, but most dives are typically shallower than 15 m and shorter than 5 minutes. During the summer foraging areas are not limited by proximity to haul out sites, and animals may spend up to six months at sea. Foraging appears to be primarily benthic (Dmitrieva 2013).<br/><br/>Caspian Seals feed on a variety of fish species. During the summer and autumn, Seals move to and congregate where prey are abundant, particularly Caspian Kilka (<em>Clupeonella </em>sp.), Caspian Silverside (<em>Atherina mochon</em>), and Caspian Gobies (<em>Gobidae</em>) (Krylov 1990), with <em>Clupeonella </em>species historically making up a major proportion of their total annual diet (Kosarev and Yablonskaya 1994). A report on fish found in the stomachs of Seals in the northern Caspian in 1986-1987 (Piletskii and Krylov 1990) suggested that fish eaten in order of frequency were Roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>), Zander (<em>Lucioperca lucioperca</em>), Gobies (<em>Knipowitschia </em>sp., <em>Neogobius kessleri</em> and <em>Benthophilus </em>sp.), and Bream (<em>Blicca bjoerkna </em>and <em>Abramis brama</em>), followed by C. deliculata and other species. A preliminary study from faecal samples collected on the Apsheron Peninsula in June 2001 and March 2002 suggested that Gobies, Silverside, and shrimp were important constituents of the diet of Seals at those times (Eybatov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). New studies of diet in Caspian Seals are required in order to get an accurate picture of current prey in different areas of the Caspian in light of potential changes to the abundance of fish species due to recent ecological changes occurring in the region.","Unsustainable hunting was the main driver of Caspian Seal decline during the 20th century (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012), and human caused mortality continues to be the main ongoing threat to the population. Recently, by-catch of Seals, primarily in illegal Sturgeon fisheries has been identified as a major cause of Seal mortality (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on semi-structured interviews conducted in fishing communities from Dagestan (Russia), Astrakhan region (Russia), and Atyrau region (Kazakhstan), Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2013) documented a minimum by-catch of 1,215 Seals during the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93% of which occurred in illegal Sturgeon fisheries. However, the study sampling reflected less than 10% of the overall poaching activity in the north Caspian, so the actual by-catch is likely to be substantially higher, and to exceed the Potential Biological Removal level (Wade <em>et al.</em> 1998) for the population (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Moreover, the survey did not cover fisheries in the middle and southern Caspian. Iranian commercial fisheries cause an estimated mortality of 500 Seals annually (Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). Further work is needed to fully quantify Seal by-catch rates throughout the Caspian Sea, and its implications for population demography. Fishermen frequently sell skins and blubber from bycaught Seals.<br/><br/>Natural sources of mortality include predation and disease. The primary non-human predators are Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Sea Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus </em>spp.). Krylov (1990) estimated that Wolves killed 17-40% of Caspian Seal pups on “some breeding grounds from 1974 to 1976”, while Eagles took less than 1% of pups. The reverse was found during recent aerial surveys (Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). Few Wolves were observed each year between 2005-2012, but up to 3,100 Eagles. Eagles are likely to primarily scavenge afterbirth and dead pups, but may also be capable of killing unaccompanied unweaned pups.<br/><br/>Mass mortality events occurred in 1997 and 2000-2001, killing several thousand Seals each time, and have since been attributed to canine distemper virus (CDV). Presence of a hitherto unknown strain of CDV was confirmed in one dead Seal in 1997 (Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 1998), and the same strain was confirmed as the primary cause of death in Seals dying in 2000 in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Examination of archived stranding records in Azerbaijan since 1971, show an increased mortality every few years, suggesting the possibility of previous outbreaks of CDV (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). A serology study of archived samples indicated that CDV was present in Caspian Seals in 1993, 1997, and 1998 (Ohashi <em>et al.</em> 2001). There have been no further mass mortalities since 2001, but disease would become a concern should they reoccur.<br/><br/>Degradation of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and overexploitation of primary food resources may also be threats to Caspian Seals (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Barannik <em>et al.</em> 2004). An invasive of Comb Jellyfish, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, arrived in the Caspian Sea via ship ballast water in the Volga-Don Canal in 1999 (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000). Comb Jellyfish consume zooplankton rapidly, leading indirectly to a reduction in fish stocks and a substantial impact on local fisheries. A 70% reduction in commercial landings of three species of Kilka was recorded within three years of the Comb Jellyfish invasion (Kideys <em>et al.</em> 2005). Kilka are thought to be important prey for Caspian Seals in the central and southern parts of the sea, and the invasion of Comb Jellyfish is considered a threat to the Seals (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). In addition to impacts from Comb Jellyfish, most commercial fisheries in the Caspian are considered to be severely depleted or extinct due to unsustainable fishing practices and/or loss of fish habitats such as spawning grounds (Strukova and Guchgeldiyev 2010). While Caspian Seals are known to feed to on commercially important fish species, commercial catch rates are not necessarily an indicator of prey availability, and Seals have a varied and adaptable diet which includes non-commercial species such as Gobies. To date is has not been possible to make any quantitative assessment on potential impacts from changes in Caspian food webs and Caspian Seal energetics and demography. Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2015) did not find a significant correlation when testing for association between annual pup production and net primary productivity 2005-2012, but a longer time series of surveys is required to achieve adequate statistical power.<br/><br/>The Caspian Sea has no outlet and receives most of its input from the Volga, Ural, and other rivers. Contamination of the Volga with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, but levels in Seals do not appear to be elevated, with the exception of zinc in some diseased animals that may have suffered homeostatic disturbance of trace metal levels (Anan <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Organochlorine levels (principally polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs)) have been assessed for Caspian Seals dying in the 1997-2001 CDV epizootics (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1999; Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2008; Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most animals were found to have levels below thresholds believed to cause toxic effects in mammals. Overall levels in Caspian Seals were lower than those seen in European Seal species, comparable to Baikal Seals, and higher than those reported for Arctic species (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Presently there is no evidence that organochlorine burdens in Caspian Seals cause reproductive or immune impairment, or contributed to the 1997-2001 CDV outbreaks at a population level, although some individual Seals may have high burdens (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002,&#160;Härkönen&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Organochlorine accumulation was found to be primarily age related, which means animals at the older end of the age distribution may be at risk of crossing toxicity thresholds towards the end of their reproductive lifespan (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has been recommended that levels of persistent organic pollutants should be monitored in the future due to the continuing industrial development around the Caspian region and time elapsed since the last survey following the CDV epizootics (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Combined juvenile mortality from continued hunting, natural predation, and fisheries by-catch is believed to be unsustainable. Overall mortality before breeding from all sources is likely to be in the region of 50% (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Demographic models indicate such a high rate of juvenile mortality would be capable of causing a continuing decline in the Caspian Seal population, with lowered fertility due to organochlorine contamination being a relatively minor factor (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Variation in annual pup production determined from aerial surveys makes empirical estimation of current population trends uncertain (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b), and a longer time series is necessary to assess the demographic trajectory directly.<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species with no option to migrate to alternative habitats, Caspian Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). Warming may cause a reduction in the spatial extent, temporal duration, and stability of the winter ice breeding habitat. Premature break-up of the ice sheet before pups are moulted will cause significant mortality among pups of the year. January-March 2007 was one of the mildest winters in the Caspian in recent years, with ice cover suitable for breeding limited to a narrow strip along the coastline of the north-east Caspian. Storms in mid-February may have caused ice-flows with large numbers of pups to be swept out to sea, and pup counts for that year were less than one third the maximum observed for 2005-2012 (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). It has also been suggested that poor ice conditions may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV outbreaks due to Seal crowding on limited haulout space and poor condition of weaned pups (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Long term trends in Caspian Sea ice cover and the implications for population demography remain to be fully assessed.<br/><br/>Through the geological history of the Caspian, there have been several substantial fluctuations of sea level (Dumont 1998), which will have affected the relative amounts of shallow and deep water habitats available to Seals. The population adapted to those past changes, but there is some concern about whether the same will be possible for future sea level changes given added pressures of habitat loss and human impacts.<br/><br/>Further threats to the Seals on shore and on ice now come from increasing disturbance due to offshore and shoreline developments. One of the largest oil fields in the world is currently being developed in the Caspian, with the construction of numerous offshore oil drilling islands, pipelines, shipping access to these, and onshore logistics facilities. A recent study found that breeding Seals are using shipping channels as artificial leads into the ice and are giving birth close to the edge of these channels. A significant proportion of the breeding population and pups may therefore experience disturbance by shipping traffic depending on the ice conditions (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). More research is required to quantify the likely impacts of this intensive oil development. The coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran have also seen increased development for domestic and leisure use in recent years, with many previously undisturbed stretches of coast now being developed.<br/><br/>Disturbance of island and reef haulout sites by illegal fishing activities and opportunistic Seal hunting are another ongoing problem. Recent surveys have found that the Caspian Seal has effectively disappeared from Azerbaijan, with the once important haulout sites of the Apsheron Peninsula and Archipelago abandoned. These sites were used by many thousands of Seals until the 1930s when they were heavily hunted (Krylov 1990). However, between 1997 and 2002 a few hundred Seals were still counted regularly at these sites (e.g., Allchin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Few live Seals have been seen in this area since 2004 (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). The overall Caspian Seal population decline since 2002 is unlikely to account for this total disappearance, which is most probably due in part to severe disturbance by illegal fishing and other coastal activities (T. Eybatov, unpublished data). Similar declines in the regularity of Seal occupancy have also been noted recently at other sites, such as South West Island near the Ural Delta and Osushnoy Island (Kazakhstan), Bautino (Kazakhstan), and in Turkmenbashi Bay (Turkmenistan). The number of Seals at Ogurchinsky Island (Turkmenistan) has also declined from several thousand in the 1980s to a few hundred (P. Erokhin, unpublished observations). The only previously recorded haulout site in Iran, at Ashoora Island, is no longer used by Seals (H. Asadi pers. comm.). There is a need to develop an inventory of all haulout sites throughout the Caspian together with archived and current records of Seal occupancy (Wilson and Goodman 2012).","Historically, the population of Caspian Seals was estimated to have exceeded one million (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). The most recent estimates of abundance are based on aerial surveys of the breeding population on the northern ice field conducted annually in February between 2005 and 2012 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). During this period estimated annual pup production ranged between 8,200 (95% confidence intervals 7,130-9,342) and 34,000 (95% confidence intervals 31,275-36,814). This would suggest there are currently approximately 68,000 reproductively mature individuals (male and female, based on the greatest observed pup production), with the total population in the region of 104,000 to 168,000 individuals derived from an age structured model (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2012; Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). Variation in weather conditions during surveys may account for some of difference in pup counts between years, but additional contributions from biological factors affecting fecundity cannot be excluded at this time (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). The variability in annual pup makes the current population trend uncertain, and a longer time series is necessary to directly assess the demographic trajectory (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). However, if pup mortality exceeds 50% due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes (a realistic scenario), this could be sufficient to result in ongoing declines (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>The population decline throughout the 20th century has been reconstructed by a demographic model using hunting statistics. By the 1950s–1960s, the population was estimated from this model to have been reduced to between 400,000-500,000 Seals (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), while an estimate based on a harvest of 86,000 pups in 1966, believed to be most pups born that year, also produced an estimate of 500,000 Seals for that year (Krylov 1990). Aerial surveys conducted in 1976 and 1980 suggested an estimate of 450,000 animals (Krylov 1990), although the hind-casting analysis suggests a population of only about 200,000 Seals remaining at that time (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Surveys in 1987 and 1989 resulted in an estimate of approximately 360,000-400,000 (Krylov 1990), but again the hind-casting analysis suggests this might again have been an over-estimate, with perhaps only about 130,000 Seals remaining by the late 1980s. Overall, the hind-casting analysis indicated a population reduction of about 66% during 1867-1964 and a further reduction of 73% during 1965-2005 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) estimated the total population of adult females as 354,210 in 1945 and 21,000 in 2005, later revised to 34,000 by Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015b) after accounting for survey observation errors. Although pup production has been revised upwards in more recent publications, this would not affect the relative decline, since it would imply correspondingly higher historical population sizes. The IUCN Criterion A calculator was used to project declines over a three generation period 1955-2015, indicating adult female numbers declined 91.5%. However, the scale of decline is dependent on estimated values for parameters such as pup survival and fertility rates, about which there is some uncertainty (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Therefore a more conservative position for the purposes of IUCN classification would be to accept a relative decline of at least 70% until more data are available to refine the historical demography.<br/><br/>Generation time from Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) is 18.8 years.",Unknown,"Caspian Seals are confined to the Caspian Sea. They range throughout the sea with seasonal migration between the southern, middle, and northern basins. More than 99.9% of breeding takes place on ice, which covers the shallow northern parts of the Caspian Sea in from late December to early April in typical years (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013, Dmitrieva <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015a). Occasional observations have been made of low numbers (a few tens of individuals) breeding on islets off Turkmenistan (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013).","Caspian Seals have been commercially exploited since the late 18th century. Harvests averaged 119,000-174,000 per year throughout the 19th century, with peaks of 300,000 having been recorded. In the 20th century, harvest levels peaked in the 1930s with an average annual harvest of 164,000 and a maximum single year take of 227,600. The numbers of Seals taken fell during World War II to an average of 60,800 per year, and subsequently ranged between a low of 41,400 and a high of 108,300 for the period 1951-1975 (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Commercial harvesting was temporarily halted in 1996 after a much-reduced estimated take of 14,000 Seals. Since the start of the 21st century smaller scale commercial and scientific hunting has taken place in Russia, typically with recorded hunts of tens or hundreds of individuals per year, with a maximum of 4,600 (in 2003-2004), reported for the period up to 2010. Official hunting is conducted under a quota system administered by an inter-governmental body, the Caspian Bioresources Commission. Typical annual quotas are for 18,000 Seals, with 8,000 allocated to Russia, and the remainder divided among the other Caspian states. The scientific rationale for the quotas is not clear. Currently only Russia actively pursues official hunting under the quota, but large scale hunting does not appear to be commercially viable at present and recorded takes are far below the official quota levels (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). The level of ‘unofficial’ or illegal hunting is poorly documented, but illegal hunting on ice on the scale of hundreds of Seals is known to take place periodically (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Seal skins are used for hats and other clothing in Russia, while Seal blubber is used as a medicinal tonic, fishing bait, and cattle feed in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The total economic value and trading networks for Seal products remain to be fully determined, but high quality individual seal skins may sell for up to $100 US dollars at the point of origin, while seal oil can sell for $14.00 per litre in local markets (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Various prohibitions, quotas, and protective measures have been taken to conserve the Caspian Seal, beginning in 1940 when seal nets were prohibited. The harvest of moulting Seals in the spring was ended in 1946, and in 1952 the Apsheron Archipelago in Azerbaijan was closed to sealing. Female harvesting on the breeding grounds was stopped in 1966 and all take was prohibited on the eastern islands of the northern Caspian in 1967. These last two changes led to a complete change in the commercial harvest, resulting in a switch to newborn and moulted pups. Quotas on harvest of pups, purportedly based on biological data, began in 1970 (Krylov 1990), although in retrospect the quotas were at unsustainable levels. The Russian Federation continues to consider the Caspian Seal to be a ‘harvested’ species, with quotas set through the Caspian Bioresources Commission (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2012).<br/><br/>A Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan was approved by the nations bordering the Caspian Sea, pursuant to the 2003 Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Caspian Environment Programme 2007), but it had no legally binding actions. The action plan recommended cessation of hunting, measures to reduce by-catch in legal and illegal fisheries, and the strategic creation of protected areas of sea, ice, and shore. However, to date none of the Caspian states have taken steps to implement the action plan. In 2012 the CaspEco Project, a UNDP funded follow up to the Caspian Environment Programme, published a framework report and road map for the establishment of a network of protected areas for Caspian Seals, including suitable locations (Wilson and Goodman 2012), but no further action has yet taken place. A number of small non-governmental organizations within Caspian countries are involved in producing educational materials and promoting awareness of Caspian Seals. In Iran, localised work with fishing communities has been conducted promoting release rather than killing of live animals found entangled in fishing gear, and a stranded seal rehabilitation facility has been established. In 2014 the Caspian States banned all catching of wild Sturgeon and in recent years Kazakhstan has increased maritime patrols to counter Sturgeon poaching which in principle may have potential to also help reduce seal by-catch.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The decline is estimated to have exceeded 30% in the last 14 years (three generations).<br/><br/>Some populations in protected areas (e.g., in Azerbaijan and Iran) are stable or possibly increasing. However, other populations throughout the range are subject to several threats and declines are widely reported. The population in Turkmenistan has almost disappeared in recent years. The largest population in Kazakhstan, formerly numbering <em>ca </em>20,000, has also drastically declined in the last few years. In Mongolia, a substantial proportion of the known global population remained until recently, but heavy poaching has wiped out almost all the large herds and cut the numbers by well over 50%.","This gazelle inhabits a wide range of semi-desert and desert habitats. It ascends into foothills and penetrates mountain valleys in Central Asia, to altitudes of 2,700 m in Mongolia (Bannikov 1954). Goitered Gazelles make seasonal movements in search of pasture and water and in northern parts of the range avoid areas of heavy snow in winter.","The main threats to this species are illegal hunting (for meat and to a lesser extent for trophies) and habitat loss (due to economic development, conversion to agriculture, increasing numbers of domestic livestock). In Central Asia the species is susceptible to the effects of severe winter weather. Barriers in the form of linear infrastructure and fences are an emerging threat in Central Asia.","Numbers were estimated at 120,000-140,000 in Mallon and Kingswood (2001), but populations throughout the range have decreased since then and are subject to continuing illegal hunting and habitat loss. The former population in Turkmenistan has virtually disappeared. Numbers in Azerbaijan are 4,000-6,000. In Iran, the 2015 estimate by the Department of the Environment numbers was <em>ca</em> 20,000, virtually all in protected areas. Mongolia was thought to contain the largest remaining population of the species (estimated at 60,000 in the early 1990s; Amgalan 1995), so holding an estimated 40-50% of the global population (Lhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2001). However, this population has been heavily reduced by poaching and this decline is continuing. Drastically reduced in Pakistan, and may be on the verge of  extinction there. Poaching is still a factor across the range and numbers are continuing to  decline overall.",Decreasing,"This species occurs from Mongolia and northwest China through Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and marginally in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan) to Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan and also the south Caucasus (Mallon and Kingswood 2001). Their historical range has contracted greatly.<br/><br/>Goitered Gazelle remains widespread in Mongolia, the Tarim Basin region of Xinjiang, China, and parts of Kazkhstan. There is a substantial population in Shirvan N.R. Azerbaijan, and a small population in the north of the country. Animals from Shirvan have recently been reintroduced to four sites in Azerbaijan and one site in south-east Georgia.<br/><br/>In Iran, Goitered Gazelles are almost entirely restricted to protected areas. Distribution in Pakistan was limited to the Chagai Desert and adjoining areas but range and numbers have been drastically reduced.&#160; &#160; <br/><br/>Populations in the Arabian Peninsula and southeast Turkey are now considered to be <em>G. marica</em>.

50662471,18149,Prionailurus rubiginosus,Near Threatened,,2016,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species is listed Near Threatened as it is very close to qualifying for Vulnerable under criterion A3c.<br/><br/>Since the last assessment additional information on the species is now available in the form of new location records (Patel 2006, Patel and Jackson 2005, Vyas <em>et al.</em> 2007, Behera 2008, Athreya 2010, Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2010, Jugal Tiwari <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Anonymous 2013, Ramjan Choudhary and Rabin Kadariya <em>in litt.</em> 2014, Mali and Srinivasulu 2015) that indicate a larger range than previously known.<br/><br/>A paucity of data on population estimates and the impact of land use changes on the species impedes a more confident assessment. Nevertheless, preliminary analysis on available data suggests that the species is negatively impacted by intensive irrigated agriculture that has fragmented its prime habitat and perhaps also its population in India (see Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;The absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, a future prediction on population decline can be made based on available information on the geographical range of the species, niche model analysis and current change in land use regimes.<br/><br/>Most of the distributional range of the species in India and Nepal lies outside the protected area network and in the deciduous forests of central India which are severely disturbed. The total extent of prime habitat in India and Nepal is around 25% of the total distributional range within these countries.<br/><br/>The current (2015) Government of India has made provisions for speedy approval of developmental projects in non-protected areas including areas under mining, industrialisation and urbanisation (Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Moreover, there are plans for expanding the national area under agriculture by 10% by 2017 (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014), a development which will continue in the future. Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species are rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy since the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. The impact of this development on persistence of biodiversity remains unclear.<br/><br/>Assuming 10 years as the average life span of the Rusty-spotted Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year, we estimate the average age of mature individuals (Generation Length - GL) in the current population at around 4 years, using the formula by Pacifici <em>et al.</em> (2013): GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3, Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR). In the next three Rusty-spotted Cat generations, i.e. 12 years, the prime locations where populations are likely to persist are protected areas as these are the only zones remaining close to intact. This translates to 75% of habitat in the current distributional range facing an imminent danger of being converted. As much of this is marginal habitat for the species, a 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over the next three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population and therefore has a concomitantly greater contribution to the overall ‘average’ global change.<br/><br/>Therefore, a future decline of 20-25% over the next three generations is suspected, occurring primarily due to projected habitat loss in central India, with populations stable only in protected areas and little information available about the small proportion of the population found in Sri Lanka.","Though the species is also found in proximity to human habitation (Worah 1991, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mukherjee 1998, Nekaris 2003), preliminary results of a study using niche models and known Rusty-spotted Cat locations within India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material), suggests that at a broad scale this cat’s distribution is limited by large contiguous tracts of hostile habitat, specifically intensive, irrigated agriculture (Silva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These results were a consensus of four models that incorporated land cover, bioclimatic variables and disturbance measures with 61 location points of the species. The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>There are recent records of the Rusty-spotted Cat from the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka in small, mostly isolated forest patches (&lt;5 km²) interspersed with tea estates but it is not known if the species occurs in or uses the tea plantation areas (Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). <br/><br/>A few observations suggest that the species preys on rodents (Kunal Patel and Vidya Athreya <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em>).","Habitat loss and the spread of cultivation are serious problems for wildlife in South Asia. The total extent of prime habitat of the Rusty-spotted Cat in India and Nepal is equivalent to around 25% of the range of the species in these countries. These are perhaps the only areas where populations of the species are likely to persist in the future. This translates to 75% of the current habitat in India and Nepal facing an imminent danger of conversion to urban areas, industry, mining and other forms of land use hostile to Rusty-spotted Cat (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014, Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species is rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy during the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. Categorization of certain portions of the species’s habitat (scrub, degraded forest) as wasteland facilitates such conversion (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.). <br/><br/>As much of the distributional range constitutes marginal habitat for the species, this 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population<br/><br/>Since much of the species’s range is within hugely human-dominated areas undergoing rapid land use change, fragmentation of habitat and disease should be considered as serious threats. There are concerns regarding possible hybridization of Rusty-spotted Cat with domestic cats (Kittle and Watson 2004) but these have yet to be substantiated and measured to determine if this factor is indeed a threat to the species. There is a belief that Rusty-spotted Cats do not get into conflict, unlike Jungle Cats, since they are believed not to prey on poultry (Manakadan and Sivakumar 2006). However, this needs to be backed by research and the threats need to be evaluated across the species’s global distribution. <br/><br/>Reflecting the uncertainty of this assessment, the species should be prioritised for research and monitoring.","Information on this species is not just meagre but also incidental and hence it is difficult to infer, with confidence, its population size, connectivity between populations, threats, and persistence in the future. It appears to be rare almost wherever it occurs (Kunal Patel and Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). <br/><br/>Population trend: the absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, the niche model from India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material) suggests a fragmented population.&#160;The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country (Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"The Rusty-spotted Cat was earlier believed to be restricted to India and Sri Lanka but recent photographic records show its presence in Bardia National Park, Nepal (Ramjan Choudhary and Rabin Kadariya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), bordering India. Its geographical distribution is as yet not clearly documented but recent locality records suggest it is more widespread than earlier believed (Chakraborty 1978, Phillips 1984, Wright 1984, Miththapala 2006, Athreya 2010, Mukherjee <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Raza Kazmi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Jugal Tiwari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Anonymous 2013, Dharmendra Khandal <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Pankaj Koparde and Gaurang Gowande <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,&#160;Ramjan Choudhary and&#160;Rabin Kadariya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Nevertheless it has a relatively restricted global distribution for a cat and little is known of its ecology or local abundance (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Within India the distribution of this species is similar to, though far more restricted than, the Jungle Cat <em>Felis chaus</em> (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.).",,Terrestrial,"The Indian population is included on CITES Appendix I, while the Sri Lanka and Nepal populations are included on CITES Appendix II.

It has been found under leaf litter, logs and other cover close to streams. At night, it has been observed crawling over leaf litter in wet conditions (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). It is not likely to tolerate habitat disturbance, as it requires canopy cover (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). It is expected to reproduce by direct development, as with other congeners.","The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). The cultivation of cardamom, coffee, and flowers is taking place within the boundaries of Parque Nacional Cusuco (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019), and associated pollution from herbicide and pesticide use, and water pollution from coffee harvesting processes [aguas mieles] (L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019). Another major threat is an increase in intentional human-induced fires for clearing of habitat for agriculture (J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019). The building of roads in view of increasing hydroelectric development, increasing human settlements, and selective logging are causing habitat loss within the park (J. Kolby, F. Castañeda, J.M. Solís and L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019). The trampling of leaf-litter, erosion of trails, and physical disturbance caused by high numbers of people through tourism activities and international research groups is an additional issue (J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Climate change is also considered to be a threat. Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Honduras (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).","It is a fossorial species which is difficult to detect, and it is uncommonly encountered (J.

Some individuals have been found during the day under mosses, roots, or within decomposing logs. High densities of individuals have been observed in disturbed habitats (ie. secondary vegetation with abundant mosses and rotten logs on the edges of trails) (Javier García, personal communication 2020). Ants, mites, and pseudoscorpions are the most frequent items found in its diet (Cadenas <em>et al</em>. 2009, Díaz de Pascual <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is a direct developing species.</p>","Despite occurring within Sierra de La Culata National Park, some of the cloud forests  where it lives are being lost due to deforestation and land use change, for example urbanization, agriculture, livestock farming, wood plantations,  logging, and roads and power line construction (Oliveira-Miranda <em>et al</em>.  2010). Tourism activities, illegal moss collection for traditional or  commercial purposes, and naturally occurring landslides may also represent minor  threats. This species has not been tested for <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>. However, because this pathogen is widespread in Cordillera de Mérida (Lampo <em>et al</em>. 2008) and has been reported in closely-related species (ie.&#160;<em>B. leandrae</em> and <em>B. tamaense -&#160;</em>Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 201,; see Table S4 in Scheele <em>et al</em>. 2019), some highly vulnerable (Cheng <em>et al</em>. 2011), chytridiomycosis could represent a threat for this species. This species could be highly vulnerable to climate change (Foden <em>et al</em>. 2013); accordingly, their populations are expected to be affected in the future. Parasitic trypanosomatids have been detected in this species (Gustavo Fermín, unpublished data), but their effect on the population is unknown.<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “Bsal”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Venezuela.<p><br/></p>","<p>This species is rare in San Javier del Valle, Monte Zerpa, and San Eusebio Forest Reserve, but common in El Chorotal, Estancia La Bravera, and in the Macho Capaz region.</p>",Stable,"This species is known from several localities (<em>eg.</em> San Javier del Valle, Monte Zerpa, Macho Capaz region, San Eusebio Forest Reserve, El Chorotal and Estancia La Bravera) along Sierra La Culata in Cordillera de Mérida, Mérida state, in Venezuela.

61977573,13897,Moschus moschiferus,Vulnerable,A2d+3d+4d,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"In the 1970s the population size was estimated at 60,000-80,000 in Mongolia (Dulamtseren 1977). The Institute of Biology of the Mongolian Academy of Science assessed the Mongolian population size in 1986 over 53,000 hectares across 63 units of six provinces, resulting in an estimate of 44,000 individuals. The population size is continuing to decrease: densities fell from six per 5 km<sup>2</sup>, to one per 5 km<sup>2</sup> in one observed population between 1990 and 2000 (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000, Tsendjav 2002). Similar levels of declines due to poaching are believed to have taken place elsewhere within its range. Generation length has been estimated as six years based on data from Nowak (1991). As the causes of this decline, primarily exploitation, is expected to result in a population reduction of at least 30% over the next three generations, <em>Moschus moschiferus</em> qualifies as Vulnerable under Criterion A3d, and as well as A2d and A4d because of past declines. Further research could show that the species is declining more seriously than has been supposed, and could possible qualify for listing as Endangered.","Inhabiting mountainous taiga (broadleaf and needle forest), these animals are typically found in forests of dense birch (<em>Betula</em> spp.) and larch (<em>Larix</em> spp.), and shrub-covered slopes in sub-alpine zones (Dulamtseren 1977, Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989, Tsendjav 2002). In Russia it inhabits the mid-mountain belt where it prefers dark coniferous forest with dense shrubs and rocky outcrops, using such rocky areas to escape from predators (Prohod’ko 2002). However, lichens are the main part of Siberian Musk Deer diet, accounting for up to 99% of the food intake in winter. During the rest of the year the percentage of lichen in the diet is still high, but these deer also consume grasses, leaves and mushrooms. When feeding it is able to climb on inclined trunks up to 3-4 m above ground. Population density is highly correlated with the availability of food and hiding places. The average population density is about 0.6 animals per square kilometre, although under favourable conditions this may be as high as 4-8.5 animals per square kilometre (Prohod’ko 2002). It has a thick coat for insulation and is well adapted for walking through deep snow.  The species is preyed upon by a suite of predators including lynx, wolverine, yellow-throated marten, and rarely wolf, tiger, and bear. When chased, musk deer head for rocky terrain, and will try to reach an inaccessible crag or a shelter. If neither is available, the animal begins to run in circles. Although they can run exceptionally fast, musk deer tire after only 200-300 metres.<br/><br/>It is solitary, though it sometimes occurs in small groups (no more than three individuals) of a female with her young. In the Altai, family groups consist usually of an adult permanent pair and the young of the year. The territory of female and young lies within the territory of a male. Sometimes the group includes young males up to two years old, that are submissive to the adult male, but actively participate in making and protecting common territory (Prohod’ko 2002). The species is primarily active at dusk and dawn. While foraging, a musk deer may travel 3-7 km per night, generally returning to the same spot (a ""lair"") every morning. Individuals inhabit home ranges between 200 and 300 hectares in size, sticking to the boundaries steadfastly. The size of the home range decreases markedly during the second half of winter. Seasonal migrations are minimal if present at all. Reproduction starts in December, although some females do not mate until March (Prohod’ko 2002). Females gestate for just over 6 months, and give birth to 1-3 offspring, usually in May or June. Young wean at 3-4 months, and are mature at 15-17 months. Animals live in the wild for 10-14 years.","As the common name suggests, males secrete musk from a preputial gland (the “musk-pod”). This musk forms the basis for many perfumes, and is highly valued for traditional medicines (Wemmer 1998). Each male produces only around 25 g of musk (Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989, Tsendjav 2002). Although this musk can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac.<br/><br/>Illegal, unsustainable hunting for musk is the principal threat to this species. An estimated 25,000 adult males were killed through harvesting and illegal hunting between 1990 and 2001 (Homes 2004). As hunting is often indiscriminate of sex and age, four to five Siberian Musk Deer are estimated to be killed per musk-pod harvested (Green 1987). As cheaper, synthetic alternatives for making perfumes are becoming more popular, use of musk in the perfume industry is decreasing, but its value for cardiac, circulatory and respiratory traditional medicines remains high. During the 1970s, the international market value of musk reached up to US$45,000 per kg. Between 1995 and 2001, the number of traders in musk increased six-fold, following a similar increase in the market price of musk-pods (Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Resource extraction such as mining is not causing a substantial loss of habitat at present, but the resulting human disturbance from this activity does constitute a threat. Habitat fragmentation may also threaten the species (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000).","During the 1920s and 1930s numbers were sharply reduced through hunting. In the 1970s the Mongolian population size was estimated to be between 60,000 and 80,000 animals (Dulamtseren 1977). In 1986, the Institute of Biology of the Mongolian Academy of Science assessed Musk Deer population sizes in over 53,000 hectares across 63 units of six provinces, resulting in an estimate of approximately 44,000 individuals. The population size in Mongolia continued to decrease: between 1990 and 2000, densities fell from six per 5 km<sup>2</sup>, to one per 5 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in one observed population (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000, Tsendjav 2002). Likewise, all populations in Russia are considered declining. Population estimates from the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in 1999 put the Sakhalin population at about 600-650 individuals (still declining), the Eastern Siberian population at about 27,000-30,000 individuals, and the population in the Russian Far East at up to 150,000 individuals (K. Tsytsulina pers. comm.).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In 2011, across 10 federal regions of Siberia the total population of the species was estimated at approximately 110,000 individuals (Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources 2012). Equivalent data appear not to be available for China or the Koreas, but this species is believed to be declining heavily there also. It is believed to be contracting in range in China, and had apparently disappeared from Xinjiang by the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.",Decreasing,"This species occurs widely in the Russian Federation (Siberia and the Far East), extreme eastern Kazakhstan, northeastern and northwestern China, Mongolia, Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Tsendjav 2002).

There are inferred to be fewer than 1,000 mature individuals (and certainly fewer than 10,000) in the population. Colonies are usually small, numbering only a few individuals. The greatest number of mature individuals counted at a single site was ± 40. All recorded colonies are suspected to comprise the same subpopulation. An ongoing decline is inferred to be taking place as a result of loss of habitat due to poor land-use management practices, mining activities, agricultural intensification as well as infestation by alien invasive plant species. Further field surveys and vetting of museum records are needed to more accurately delimit the distribution range of the species. Currently, we list the species as Vulnerable C2a(ii) and D1.</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">The species mainly occurs in the Mesic Highveld Grassland Bioregion but also occurs in the Lowveld Bioregion and the Central Bushveld Bioregion. Key roosting sites include subterranean habitats like caves and old mine adits. They have been recorded day-roosting in rock crevices and fissures, and are occasionally observed in old buildings. Thus its occurrence is in most cases subject to suitable sheltered and/or subterranean habitats. Regions with rock habitats that form cavities are of utmost importance for the survival of this species. Artificially created habitat such as abandoned mine or prospecting shafts/tunnels within various vegetation types also serve as important/essential habitat sanctuaries. <em>Rhinolophus cohenae</em> requires suitable natural habitat outside roost sites for foraging. Individuals are normally encountered in very small groups of which around 40 was the highest number counted at one locality consisting of a maze of old mine tunnels.&#160;</p>","The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) mapped all development applications received at a cadastral scale over a 14-year period (2000-2014), which showed that greatest pressure for land-use change has come from prospecting applications (54% of the land surface area) and mining (25% of land surface area) (Lötter <em>et al</em>. 2014). A major threat within this species’ range is mining (legal, illegal and recommissioning of old mines). Future developments at the above rates or even higher are likely to cause further detriment towards natural ecosystems and processes and in particular, disturb or destroy foraging grounds and roosting and maternity sites, or alter key micro-climates needed by the species. Additionally, loss of natural habitat around roost sites through poor land-use management practices, (such as inappropriate burning regimes, overgrazing and alteration of vegetation structure negatively affect foraging areas and prey base), land development activities including agricultural intensification (Driver <em>et al</em>. 2012), and alien invasive plant infestations are causing a decline in available habitat for foraging.<br/><br/>Climate change may also influence micro-climate distribution. This species is very dependent on suitable subterranean environments for roosting and maternity requirements and associated natural habitats for foraging. These sites are limited throughout its distribution range and beyond. The effects of climate change can severely impact on the survival of this species if the above is not provided for and not adequate for habitation any more.","<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">In total, 240 individuals have been counted in surveys but this is an underestimate.

However, the species' extent of occurrence is only 0.65 km² (less than 0.1% of its natural range)&#160;and it is continually threatened by invasive species, inbreeding depression, and natural disasters. Continued conservation management, population monitoring and invasive species control are needed to guarantee the species persistence.",This species is found in habitats with dense undergrowth; the surviving population is found in an area characterized largely by littoral dry forest and scrub. Historically the species presumably occurred in wetter habitats on mainland Antigua.,"Invasive mammals, in particular black rats and mongooses, are a major threat to this species and are responsible for its dramatic historical decline in abundance and its extinction on Antigua. Although some of the islands now inhabited have been cleared of invasive predators, re-invasions are a threat. Rats re-invaded Great Bird Island in 2001, but were eradicated the same year (J. Daltry pers. comm. 2010). In late 2005, rats reappeared on Green Island (Daltry 2006), probably transported by visitor boats, but these were successfully eradicated in 2006. <br/><br/>This species is threatened by loss of genetic variation due to its small population size: genetic studies have confirmed the  species to be critically inbred (S. Funk, unpubl. data, Daltry <em>et al</em>. in review), and fertility is low.<br/><br/>Hurricanes can cause flooding on the lowland areas of the island. J. Daltry (pers. comm. 2010) observed a 20% population decline on Great Bird Island after Hurricane Georges in 1998, the storm surges of which flooded more than 10% of the island.<br/><br/>Visitors to the islands may disturb snakes and could affect feeding and mating behaviour. Incidents of visitors killing snakes have also been reported. In addition, activities such as mowing, trampling, and allowing camp fires to burn out of control may pose threats to the viability of the very small population of this species. Visitor numbers on Great Bird Island have gone up to over 60,000 visitors per year, which has gone up dramatically from only 17,000 visitors per year during the mid 1990s (J. Daltry pers. comm. 2015).There are also well-substantiated reports of snakes being taken as pets (Daltry <em>et al.</em> in review).","In 1995, J.

Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small geographically isolated subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt; 1000 mature individuals. Anthropogenic mortality of only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals per year from a population of 100 individuals would result in 30%, 50% and 80% declines in population abundance after 3 generations, respectively (see Moore 2015 Table 5).</p>  <p>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the species’ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the species’ range in Australia (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012; Bejder<em> et al.</em> 2012; Cagnazzi<em> et al.</em> 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown<em> et al.</em> 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell<em> et al.</em> 2013). Additionally, the species’ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  Considering the available evidence and following a precautionary approach we considered this species as Vulnerable under IUCN criterion C2a(i) because the total number of mature individuals is plausibly fewer than 10,000, a projected continuing decline due to cumulative impacts; and each of the defined subpopulations studied to date is estimated to contain fewer than 1,000 mature individuals. Although the species may not meet any of the criteria for Endangered at this time, it is likely to do so in the near future considering It is possible that 1) number of mature individuals is less than 2,500, 2) the reductions in population size have been larger and pervasive enough to cause a net reduction for the entire species of at least 20% over a period of 2 generations and 3) that the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation across their range is ≤ 250 individuals.","<p>Within their geographical range Australian Humpback Dolphins are found primarily in coastal waters. Opportunistic data collected during aerial surveys designed to estimate the distribution and abundance of Dugongs (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) in the Great Barrier Reef indicated that Australian Humpback Dolphins were sighted on average 6.4 km (se = 1.26, Range 0-55.6 km) from the nearest point of land and 2.7 km (std. err. = 0.27, range = 0-8.1 km) to the nearest shallow area (either point of land or charted reef, less than 2m deep at low tide) (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997). In Queensland and in the Northern Territory humpback dolphins are found mostly within 10 km off the coast (Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). Accordingly, in Keppel Bay, Central Queensland, where up to 10 km offshore waters still remain below 10m in depth, Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were recorded on average 2.8 km (SD = 4.21, Range = 0-24 km) off the coast. In Western Australia, sightings obtained from recent exploratory surveys and ongoing studies seem to confirm a similar pattern, with the majority of the sightings obtained within 5 km off the coast (Brown and Hunt personal communication). In Papua New Guinea, the first tentative sightings of Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were made in the Kikori Delta region; close to the coastline and in waters 1.6-11.4 m deep (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>While coastal waters are arguably the primary habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins, most survey work has been conducted close to the coast, thus the extent to which humpback dolphins use offshore waters is not yet fully understood. Observations of Australian Humpback Dolphins at least up to 55.6 km from land, indicate that this species may occasionally venture further offshore especially in sheltered and protected waters such as in the Great Barrier Reef where sand flats occur almost continuously from the mainland to the outer reefs (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997).</p>  <p>Along the Australian Coast Humpback Dolphins are more likely to be found in relatively shallow and protected coastal habitats such as inlets, estuaries, shallow bays, inshore reefs and coastal archipelagos rather than in open stretches of coastline. In Queensland and Northern Territory, humpback dolphins are mainly found in water less than 20 km from the nearest river mouth and in water less than 15-20 m deep (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). Few animals have been observed in waters up to 30-50 m deep, but remained in close proximity (within 5 km) to the coast (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). In both Queensland and Northern Territory humpback dolphins have been also recorded as far as 20-50 km upstream in large rivers such as the East Alligator River, Northern Territory, and in the Fitzroy and Brisbane rivers in Queensland (Cagnazzi 2010, Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). No studies on habitat use have been conducted in Western Australia. Preliminary surveys and ongoing studies in few locations indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins appear to utilize a wide range of near-shore habitats. For example, around the North West Cape, dolphins have been sighted in clear waters over Ningaloo Reef, and in turbid waters in Exmouth Gulf, and in depths ranging from 1 to 40 m deep (T. Hunt 2015, pers. comm., 19 February) </p>  <p>Among subpopulations there appear to be some differences in habitat selection suggesting high adaptability of this species to local environment characteristics. For example, in Cleveland Bay Australian Humpback Dolphins showed preferences for waters close to the coast and 2-5 m deep, followed by waters 1-2 m deep whereas in Keppel Bay (~630 Km south) humpback dolphins showed preference for waters 2-5 and 5-10 m deep, while In Port Curtis (~700 km further south) humpback dolphins showed preference for water 5-10 and 10-15 m deep. Within these regions humpback dolphins showed selection for various types of habitats including dredged channels, reefs, seagrass flats and mangroves.</p>  Across Australia, humpback dolphins have been observed feeding in a wide range of inshore-estuarine coastal habitats including rivers and creeks, expose banks, shallow flats, rock and coral reefs as well as over submerged reefs in waters at least up to 40 m deep (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012, Cagnazzi 2010, Parra 2006, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). The analysis of stomach contents of 6 humpback dolphins stranded in Queensland indicated they are opportunistic-generalist feeders, preying on a wide variety of fishes including both bottom-dwelling species (e.g., grunts, tooth ponyfishes, croakers, flatheads, and whitings) as<strong> </strong>well as pelagic species (e.g., cardinal fishes, gizzard shads, anchovies, false trevally and barracudas) (Parra and Jedensjö 2014). Among these, Grunt fish (<em>Pomadasys</em> sp.) were the most numerically important prey accounting for more than half (52.9%) of all prey items, followed by the cardinal fish (<em>Apogon </em>sp., 10.4%) and smelt-whiting (<em>Sillago </em>sp., 9.7%) (Parra and Jedensjö 2014)","<strong>Habitat Loss and Degradation<br/></strong>Several regions across Humpback Dolphins’ range in Australia have been substantially modified both inland, to allow mining, agricultural and grazing activities and along the coast to allow industrial ports; marinas, aquaculture and residential developments. Concurrently, several mining industries are undergoing major upgrades and extensions, while new extraction sites have been proposed to meet an increasing export demand of primary resources (carbon, oil, natural gas, woods, aluminium and uranium), particularly in northwestern Australia and along the central coast of Queensland (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Queensland Government 2012). As a result significant expansions of existing ports facilities are underway across the coastal range of Australian Humpback Dolphins (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) For example, by 2020 the port capacity along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Queensland, is expected to triple to support the predicted growth in Queensland’s annual coal production (Grech <em>et al</em>. 2013). The IUCN considered this unprecedented scale of development as a serious threat to biodiversity in the GBRWHA (Douvere and Badman 2012).<br/><br/>Activities associated with coastal zone developments such as land reclamation, dredging, seismic surveys, drilling, blasting, shipping and resource extraction may result in habitat loss and degradation for Australian Humpback Dolphins. For example, it has been estimated that in the Fitzroy River, Queensland, between 14 to 25% of Australian Snubfin Dolphin (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) habitat (which largely overlaps with that of Australian Humpback Dolphins) will be directly modified if a planned industrial port development were to occur (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Besides their influence on dolphins’ habitat, these activities have the potential to cause disturbance of humpback dolphins’ normal activities through physical displacement and increasing underwater noise pollution (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dredging involved in the construction, maintenance and expansion of ports is of particular concern as it may potentially displace dolphins from important habitats as a result of changes in fish distribution, increased vessel activities, declining water quality and underwater noise (Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Todd <em>et al</em>. 2015). Because most ports across the Australian Humpback Dolphins range are located in relatively shallow waters, they all require large volumes of dredging. For example, the Gladstone Western Basin project in Queensland involved the dredging of 22 million cubic meters of soil (Ports Australia 2014).<br/><br/>Additionally habitat loss and fragmentation from coastal zone developments and associated activities can influence the population genetic structure of biological populations through their isolation (Keyghobadi 2007). Given the small densities, strong population genetic structure and limited gene flow found among subpopulations of Australian Humpback Dolphins; loss of genetic variation may reduce the ability of individuals to adapt to a changing environment, cause inbreeding depression, reduce survival and reproduction and increase their probability of extinction (Andrews 2014, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><strong><br/>By-catch</strong><br/>Human-related mortality of humpback dolphins in Australian waters is thought to be largely attributable to by-catch in shark nets set for swimmers protection by the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) and in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries for Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em> Bloch 1970) and Threadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em> Macleay 1884) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> Shaw 1804) (Hale 1997, Paterson 1990). There are no estimates of the magnitude of these indirect takes or of their trend over the time.<br/><br/>Fisheries observers on gillnet vessels operating in northern Australian waters between 1981-1985 reported one Australian Humpback Dolphin among the cetacean species incidentally taken (Harwood and Hembree 1987). At least 18 Humpback Dolphins were collected from shark nets along the Queensland coast between 1968-2001 (Haines and Limpus 2002, Heinsohn 1979). Between 1997-2007 a further 13 humpback dolphins were reported caught in the QSCP shark nets and drumlines (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Shark nets have now been removed from most of the Queensland coast and captures of dolphins appear to be small at a state level (Gribble <em>et al</em>. 1998). For example, between 2008 and 2011 no humpback dolphin was reported caught in the shark nets, despite QSCP accounting for 73% of all cetaceans mortalities (Meager <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, given the low population sizes at which this species occurs, the death of even a few individuals per year at a local level could have detrimental consequences on the viability of local subpopulations.<br/><br/><strong>Water pollution</strong><br/>Sources of anthropogenic contaminants are likely to increase in the future across northern Australia, as a result of a widespread contamination by several new pesticides (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012), increasing annual runoff (Chiew and McMahon 2002), and rapid urban and industrial development. As coastal top predators, humpback dolphins may accumulate high concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants through bioaccumulation (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>The water discharge by many rivers across the Humpback Dolphin’s range in Australia is of poor quality, often with contaminant concentrations likely to cause environmental harm (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2012, Francey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Schaffelke <em>et al</em>. 2012). For example an assessment of the relative risk of pollutants from agricultural and land uses ranked most of the rivers in Queensland as relatively high priority (Waterhouse <em>et al</em>. 2012). Agricultural and industrial-sourced pollutants have been identified as the major threats to the coastal water quality especially along the Great Barrier Reef. As a result various contaminants, were detected in sediments samples as well as in several marine species known to be part of the humpback dolphin diet (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Accordingly, a recent study detected high levels of organochlorine compounds (DDTs, PCBs, HCB) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in biopsy samples collected from humpback dolphins along the Queensland coast (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Although exposure to contaminants may not directly cause the death of an animal, it may affect the dolphins’ health in numerous ways, including an increased susceptibility to diseases and impairment of metabolic functions (Bossart 2011, De Swart <em>et al</em>. 1996). The immunosuppressive effect of contaminants may play an important role in the death of humpback dolphins following large floods and major industrial coastal developments (DEHP 2012, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Underwater Noise</strong><br/>Sounds introduced into the marine environment by anthropogenic activities (e.g., dredging, pile-driving, underwater surveying, shipping) may have detrimental effects on marine mammals by interfering with their ability to communicate, echolocate, and/or mask other important natural sounds (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 1995, Nowacek <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>For example, impulsive hammering sounds can be loud, and levels as high as 165 dB re 1 mPa were measured 1 km from a hammer used for pipe installation (Bailey <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent study conducted in the Pearl River Estuary of China, near Hong Kong, to monitor the effects of the world's largest vibration hammer (OCTA-KONG) on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins has suggested that the vibration zone detectable by individual animal extends beyond 3.5 km. While Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins clicks do not appear to be adversely affected, the whistles were susceptible to auditory masking and a safety zone of 500 m radius was proposed (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Floods</strong><br/>Peak mortality of inshore dolphins In Queensland, including Australian Humpback Dolphins, followed sustained periods of elevated freshwater discharge (9 months) (Meager and Limpus 2014). In Queensland floods exceed their natural ranges of variation due to inland catchment modifications that result in a large amount of sediments, heavy metals, nutrients and pesticides being discharged into the estuaries and adjacent coastal areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Furnas 2003). Increases in freshwater discharge may also increase exposure to infectious pathogens such as toxoplasmosis; which has been observed and thought to be the cause of death of four Australian Humpback Dolphins (Bowater <em>et al</em>. 2003). Modelling studies estimated that in some areas the annual runoff in catchments across Australia could increase to up to 15% by the year 2030, due to the increased in rainfall associated with global warming (Chiew and McMahon 2002). Thus, the resilience and recovery capacity of the entire coastal ecosystem including humpback dolphins’ preferred habitat may be put under great threat.<br/><br/><strong>Cumulative threats</strong><br/>The cumulative impact of environmental factors and anthropogenic activities is arguably the primary threat to humpback dolphins (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011). The continuous alteration of coastal systems have greatly undermined the resilience of many wildlife communities, populations, and species living in estuaries, making them more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity events and anthropogenic stressors (Hobday and Lough 2011). The loss of habitat quantity and quality has been identified among the primary drivers of population declines of marine animals. The reduction of suitable habitat may force local populations of humpback dolphins to adjust to the remaining resources through a reduction in survival rate and population size, or emigration to more suitable areas (Andren 1994, Fahrig 1997, Jefferson 2000). Such effects are likely to be exacerbated when natural systems are simultaneously subjected to multiple stressors as a result of cumulative impacts and negative synergistic interactions (Crain <em>et al</em>. 2008, Halpern <em>et al</em>. 2008, Venter <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Recent studies on other inshore dolphin populations living in highly industrialized regions have reported negative population trends. In the Pearl River estuary, China, modelling of demographic data from strandings of humpback dolphins predicted that the population was declining at about 2.4% per annum (Huang et al. 2012), in the Yangtze River the population of Yangtze Finless Porpoise is declining at a rate of about 6% p.a. (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012), while in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, the local isolated bottlenose dolphin population has declined at a rate of about 30% over the last 12 years (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2007). According to this evidence a reduction in the number of Australian Humpback Dolphins could be expected if the impacts of multiple port expansion, development projects, water pollution, vessel traffic and increasing frequency of natural catastrophic events are not properly addressed.","At present, there is no range-wide estimate of the abundance of Australian Humpback Dolphins. Estimates of abundance are available from several discrete locations across Australia (Supplementary Material: Table 1, see Fig. 1 for locations). Additionally, monitoring to estimate abundance is currently underway at several new locations in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Overall, available abundance estimates indicate that humpback dolphins occur in small subpopulations averaging 54-89 individuals and 0.1-0.19 individuals per km² (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the global number of “mature individuals” (i.e. individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction) of Australian Humpback Dolphins is challenging, because relevant demographic data are insufficient or non-existent. If we assume that the proportion of mature individuals (Nm) is similar to that estimated for the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>), which is 50% (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007), each subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) numbers &lt;105 mature individuals. Considering that all available abundance estimates for Australian Humpback Dolphins are low (typically less than 150 individuals; Table 1 in the Supplementary Material), the total number of mature individuals across their range is unlikely to exceed 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>Estimates of population size trends across the species’ range are unknown. Surveys in Cleveland Bay, northeast Queensland, (1999-2002) showed low population sizes (34-54 individuals) and no clear trends, but indicated that even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates population trends will be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size were greater than 20% p.a. (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a). A longer multiyear study (2006-2011) in the Capricorn and Curtis Coast regions, Central Queensland, showed that abundance estimates declined throughout the study in Keppel Bay and Curtis coast region from 115 and 84 individuals in 2007 to 104 and 45 in 2011, respectively (Cagnazzi 2013). The decline in abundance estimates was associated with a large flood event in 2010 and the concurrent expansion of the Port Curtis port facilities (Cagnazzi 2013). Analyses of data collected until 2014 will clarify whether the observed decline is permanent or just a temporary shift in dolphin distribution.<br/><br/>Ongoing monitoring studies (2011-2014) in Bynoe Harbor, Darwin Harbor and Shoal Bay in the Northern Territory, have shown that the numbers of humpback dolphins in these areas are quite small (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) but have remained fairly stable throughout the years (Brooks and Pollock 2014). Estimates in Port Essington Harbor, Northern Territory, varied widely (48-207) among sampling periods (2008-2010). This variation was likely due to movements in and out of the study area, temporary emigration, temporal changes in behaviour, or temporal changes in detectability (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a).<br/><br/>Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small and localized subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt;1,000 mature individuals and that there could well be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. As with other cetaceans, the low reproductive rates of Australian Humpback Dolphins make them vulnerable to even low rates of anthropogenic mortality. For example, assuming a 3% recruitment rate (as estimated for <em>S. chinensis</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em> in Moore 2015) a discrete subpopulation of 100 individuals would decline by 30%, 50% and 80% over 75 years (three generations) if only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals were removed, respectively, per year due to anthropogenic mortality (see Table 5 in Moore 2015).<br/><br/>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the species’ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the species’ range in Australia (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell <em>et al</em>. 2013). Additionally, the species’ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Population Structure</strong><br/>Overall, the genetic data available suggest that Australian Humpback Dolphins exist as a metapopulation of small and relatively isolated subpopulations with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014, Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data). Analysis of population structure using both microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequence data from humpback dolphins from the Dampier Archipelago, and the North West Cape in north Western Australia (~300 km apart) showed significant levels of population structure with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014). Similarly, analysis of population structure among eight sampling locations (from tens to 1,500 kilo meters apart) along the east coast of Queensland indicated significant population differentiation and low levels of migration rates between most sampling locations (Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data).<br/><br/>The available evidence on abundance estimates (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) and population genetic structure indicates Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small, localized populations with limited gene flow. Abundance estimates suggest that there are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. Additionally, no subpopulation studied to date is larger than 200 mature individuals (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Substantial numbers of humpback dolphins have been killed in localized areas along the east coast of Queensland in anti-shark nets set to protect bathers (Heinsohn 1979, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004) . Humpback dolphins are also known to die in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries primarily for |Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) and T|hreadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em>) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> (Anderson 1995, Hale 1997). Given the continuing vulnerability to bycatch in shark nets and gillnets, low densities in surveyed areas, and increased habitat degradation throughout their range (see threats section) it is likely that a continuing decline of at least 10% will occur over a period of 3 generations (about 75 years, assuming generation length is similar to that estimated for <em>S. chinensis </em>in Moore 2015).",Decreasing,"Australian Humpback Dolphins are found in tropical/subtropical waters of the Sahul Shelf from northern Australia to the southern waters of the island of New Guinea(Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). In Australia humpback dolphins are thought to be widely distributed along the northern Australian coastline from approximately the Queensland-New South Wales border (31°27´S, 152°55´E) to western Shark Bay, Western Australia (25°51´S, E113°20´E). However, no dedicated wide-scale surveys throughout this range have been conducted and at present, this continuous distribution is inferred primarily from localized studies; strandings, museum records and aerial surveys for other species (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004). Similarly, the extent of their distribution in the southern waters off the island of New Guinea is also still unclear due to the limited amount of marine mammal survey work carried out in this region. Recent surveys in the Kikori Delta region of Papua New Guinea reported a total of 7 groups of humpback dolphins (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014). Photographic records of these animals indicate that they are likely <em>S. sahulensis</em> but genetic studies are needed to solidly clarify which Sousa species occurs off the island of New Guinea. It is also uncertain if the species occurs in the deep waters (~30-90 m depth) over the continental shelf between Australia and Indonesian New Guinea (the Arafura Sea).<br/><br/>Most studies to date indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins occur mostly close to the coast (within 20 km from land) and in relatively sheltered offshore waters near reefs or islands (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Corkeron <em>et al</em>. 1997, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006b). Furthermore, stomach content analyses indicate Australian Humpback Dolphins feed mainly on fishes associated with coastal-estuarine waters (Parra and Jedensjö 2014). As most survey work has been conducted in coastal waters, this apparent coastal distribution and preference for inshore habitats might be biased.<br/><br/>For purposes of this assessment and in line with discussions on the distribution range for <em>S. sahulensis</em> at the IUCN Workshop to Assess/Re-Assess IUCN Red Listings for Indo-Pacific Genera of Coastal Small Cetaceans (San Diego, 20-21 May 2015), we assume Australian Humpback Dolphins occur 1) continuously across northern Australia and southern New Guinea and 2) up to the 30 m isobath (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Material). Given these assumptions we estimate their geographic range to be approximately 562,193 km² comprised of: ~405,091 km² for Australia (QLD: ~202,344 km², NT: ~98,769 and WA: ~ 103,978 km²) and ~157,102 km² for southern New Guinea. The lack of spatial information on the occurrence of Australian Humpback Dolphins throughout their inferred range precludes an accurate estimation of their extent of occurrence (EOO; i.e. area contained within the shortest continuous imaginary boundary which can be drawn to encompass all the known, inferred or projected sites of present occurrence of a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy) and area of occupancy (AOO; i.e. area within its 'extent of occurrence' which is occupied by a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy). Although both EOO and AOO are likely to be significantly less than the geographic range estimated here, the large extent of their potential distribution suggests that their EOO and AOO are very likely to be above 20,000 km².","<p>There is no robust evidence of traditional use for consumption or medicinal use across the Australian humpback dolphin’s geographical range. In the 1960-70s live-captures (at least 8 individuals) took place in Queensland, Australia, for oceanarium displays (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). A female humpback dolphin wild caught in 1968 and currently held at Sea World (Amity) is estimated to be over 48 years of age. Capture for the purposes of public display is no longer permitted under Australian law.</p>",Marine,"<p>As a recently described new species, Australian Humpback Dolphins have not been listed under any national and International listing. Previous conservation assessments as <em>S. chinensis </em>are summarized<em> </em>in Table 2. The most recent assessment of the conservation status of humpback dolphins (as <em>S. chinensis</em> ) in Australia, concluded the species should be listed as Data Deficient (Woinarski<em> et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>In 2012 The Australian Federal Government commissioned a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and conservation status of Australian tropical inshore dolphins (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2012) and a Draft Coordinated Research Strategy to address knowledge gaps and assess their national conservation status (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2012). These reports led to a technical workshop attended by researchers, statisticians and government and indigenous representatives to review the proposed research objectives identified in the draft research strategy, and agree on research priorities that would allow the assessment of the conservation status of Australian inshore dolphins at a national level. The resulting research strategy (DSEWPaC 2013) identified three specific research objectives applicable to Australian snubfin and humpback dolphins: (1) to conduct a broad-scale assessment of their extent of occurrence and area of occupancy (2) to conduct dedicated multi-year studies of their distribution, abundance and habitat use at selected sites across northern Australia with differing levels of threatening processes; and (3) to undertake a spatial and temporal risk assessment of current and projected threatening processes. Sampling and statistical methods to achieve these objectives have been recently described in Brooks<em> et al.</em> (2014). Following these advances, the Australian Federal Government released in 2014 the Whale and Dolphin Protection Plan, which includes a National Dolphin Conservation Plan. This plan aims to guide research and conservation assessment of Australian Humpback Dolphins and snubfin dolphins by supporting research into their ecology and major threats over the next three years.</p>  <p>Multiple-use marine protected areas in Western Australia (e.g. Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef Marine Park), the Northern Territory (e.g. Garig Gunak Barlu), and Queensland (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Dugong Protected Areas; Moreton Bay Marine Park) cover a substantial portion of the known and presumed habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins in Australian waters and may provide some protection for humpback dolphins. To improve the quality of water discharged into the Great Barrier Reef, in 2008, the Australian Government invested $200 million in The Reef Rescue initiative to help farmers in the Great Barrier Reef catchments to improve farming practices to reduce sediment and nutrient run-off.</p>  <p>In Australia, humpback dolphins have also been identified as a conservation value in Commonwealth waters around Australia in the North, North-west and Temperate East Marine bioregional plans (DSEWPaC 2012a, b, c). These plans were developed under section 176 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and are aimed at improving management and decision making in relation to Australian marine biodiversity and resources. Biologically Important Areas (i.e. areas where species of conservation value displays important behaviors such as breeding, foraging, resting and migration) for the conservation of humpback dolphins were identified using available information at the time and expert scientific knowledge about species’ distribution, abundance and behavior in these regions.</p>  National Guidelines for Whale and Dolphin Watching and for interaction with seismic explorations provide some protection for inshore dolphins (DOE 2005, 2008). Strategies to reduce the entanglement and death of Australian Humpback Dolphins in nets set by The Queensland Shark Control Program for protection of bathers include the use of acoustic alarms, mixed use of nets and drumlines, overall reduction in the number of nets, and establishment of mammal rescue squads (DPI 2001, Gribble<em> et al.</em> 1998).",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is highly migratory, breeding widely across Western Eurasia and wintering within the northern tropics (Scott and Rose 1996). It migrates on a broad front, the autumn migration beginning in late July and peaking in August or early September (in Europe and Egypt), with birds beginning to arrive in East and West Africa in early September, peaking in October (Scott and Rose 1996). Once the species reaches Africa it migrates in relation to seasonal flooding, the central point of its occurrence shifting gradually along the course of rivers as the winter progresses (Alerstam 1990). The spring migration begins in February, with birds beginning to arrive on breeding grounds from mid-March to early-May (Scott and Rose 1996). It is a highly sociable and gregarious species (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988), and whilst breeding can be found in single pairs or small groups, but regularly forms large congregations of several hundred on passage, and flocks of up to several thousand are common in African and Asiatic winter quarters (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). Adults undergo a post-breeding moult period that leaves them flightless for 3-4 weeks, with males moulting between mid-July and mid-August, and females between mid-August and September (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005b). The Volga Delta, in particular, is a major moulting area for this species. Birds of this species are both diurnal and nocturnal feeders, and when migrating often travel by night and rest on open water during the day (Johnsgard 1978). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>In the breeding season this species frequents small, shallow ponds and lakes with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992) (that is not too tall or dense, such as bulrush - <em>Typha spp.</em>) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Green 1998), in grass dominated environments, like swampy meadows, flooded fields, shallow freshwater marshes (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992, Schricke 2001).<em> Non-breeding</em> During this season the species shows a preference for large freshwater or occasionally brackish lakes, again with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Kear 2005b), also shallow flood plains, shallow dams, pans and sewage ponds (in South Africa) (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species also frequents coastal saltmarshes and lagoons on passage (de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992) and may spend the day resting on marine inshore waters when migrating (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> When breeding this species is omnivorous (Johnsgard 1978). In spring and summer its diet is dominated by animal matter: chiefly molluscs, aquatic insects and their larvae (waterbugs, caddisfly, waterbeetles, midges), crustaceans (ostracods and phyllopods especially), worms, leeches, young and spawn of frogs, and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). Seeds, roots, tubers, stems, leaves and buds of plants such as Hornwort <em>Ceratophyllum</em>, Naiad <em>Najas</em>, sedge, grass and other aquatic plants are also important at this time (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> During this season the birds are mainly vegetarian, with a diet dominated by the seeds of pondweeds, smartweeds <em>Polygonum</em>, sedges, dock <em>Rumex</em>, wild rice and grass (Kear 2005b), (with the seeds of <em>Echinochloa colona</em>, <em> Nymphea micranthia</em> and <em> Nymphea lotus</em> being the most preferred food items) (Treca 1981). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Meadows are the favoured nesting areas of this species, with nests rarely located more than 150 m from water (usually within 20 m) (Cramp and Simmons 1977). The nest itself is a depression in the ground, typically situated under rushes or tall grasses (such as manna grass, <em>Glyceria</em>), but not generally under shrubs (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992). <strong></strong>","<em>Breeding</em> The most significant threat encountered by this species on its breeding grounds in Europe is habitat deterioration through the drainage and reclamation of wetlands (Kear 2005b), the increasing climatic aridity and subsequent lowering of the water table, and the transformation of wetlands to dammed reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996).  Other threats to this species include the destruction of nests during the early mowing of meadows (Kear 2005b), increased human disturbance (Kear 2005b), lead poisoning, botulism during hot summers (Kear 2005b) and hunting disturbance in Africa and Europe (Vaananen 2001) (&gt; 500,000 are shot annually in Russia, Ukraine, France and Poland) (Kear 2005b). The invasive species American Mink <em>Mustela vison</em> also poses a threat through nest predation (Opermanis <em>et al.</em> 2001), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza (particularly strain H5N1) so is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).<em> Non-breeding</em> On its wintering grounds in Nigeria and Senegal the species is threatened by habitat destruction through dam construction, vegetation overgrowth and desertification (del Hoyo&#160;1992, Polet 2000, Triplett and Yesou 2000), and in West Africa it is threatened by large-scale river diversion and irrigation schemes (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also at risk from avian influenza in its African wintering grounds (Gaidet <em>et al.</em> 2007) as well as in its breeding areas (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The proportion of the species which migrates via the West Siberian flyway is susceptible to West Nile Virus, and is therefore threatened by future outbreaks (Ternovoi <em>et al.</em> 2004). <strong>Utilisation</strong> This species is hunted in Denmark , but there is evidence that this may be sustainable (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006). The species is also hunted for commercial and recreational purposes in Gilan Province, northern Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006).","The global   population is estimated to number c.2,600,000-2,800,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 352,000-524,000 pairs, which equates to 704,000-1,050,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix II.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong>The following information refers to the species's European range only: Key areas of breeding habitat for this species should be identified and protected.

The Wadden Sea for example is used by many Fennoscandian birds as a stop-over and moulting site from late-April to mid-May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Most palearctic birds are trans-Saharan migrants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), the main autumn passage through northern and temperate Europe occurring from the second week of July to late-October (Snow and Perrins 1998). One parent (usually the female) leaves the breeding territory first from late-June to early July (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), with the other parent and juveniles following around 3-6 weeks later (Snow and Perrins 1998). Flocks arrive in southern Africa and Australia from August to September, and depart again in March for the northward return migration (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species departs for its breeding grounds during the evening (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) and once there it breeds between late-April and June (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Some non-breeding birds may also remain in the south throughout the summer (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species normally breeds in very dispersed pairs (Johnsgard 1981), but on passage it can occur singly or in small flocks (flocks of 20-25 are common in southern Africa) (Snow and Perrins 1998), although congregations of 100 or more may very rarely occur at high tide or at roosting sites (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986). This species feeds both diurnally and nocturnally (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> This species breeds in the boreal forest zone from sea level to 1,200 m in Norway (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998)(although predominantly up to 450 m) (Snow and Perrins 1998), in swampy forest clearings, woody moorland, open bogs and marshes (including raised and blanket bogs) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and eutrophic lakes with margins of dead and decaying vegetation (Johnsgard 1981). It avoids bare or broken barren expanses, mountain escarpments, and closed forests with very dense, tall vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> In its wintering grounds this species frequents a variety of freshwater, marine and artificial wetlands, including swamps, open muddy or rocky shores of lakes and large rivers, sewage farms, saltworks, inundated rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), ponds, reservoirs (Snow and Perrins 1998), flooded grasslands (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005), saltmarshes, sandy or muddy coastal flats, mangroves, estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), lagoons<strong></strong>and pools on tidal reefs (Snow and Perrins 1998) or exposed coral (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986), although it generally avoids open coastline (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). On migration this species occurs on inland flooded meadows, dried-up lakes, sandbars and marshes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Diet</strong> This species is chiefly carnivorous, its diet consisting of insects and their larvae (especially beetles), crustaceans, annelids, molluscs, amphibians (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), small fish (mullet <em>Liza</em> spp., clinids <em>Clinus</em> spp. and tilapia <em>Oreochromis</em> spp.) (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005)<em> </em>and occasionally rodents (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow scrape on open ground, often in clearings in woods (Snow and Perrins 1998), and is typically placed next to a piece of dead wood (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), or beside rocks, trees (Johnsgard 1981), fences and sticks (for use as nest markers) (Snow and Perrins 1998).","In the Chinese, North Korean and South Korean regions of the Yellow Sea this species is threatened by the degradation and loss of its preferred wetland habitats through environmental pollution, reduced river flows and human disturbance (Kelin and Qiang 2006). Within Europe the species has suffered in some areas from habitat degradation caused by off-road vehicles or dry conditions causing vegetation to become rank (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","The global   population is estimated to number c.440,000-1,500,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 98,700-202,000 pairs, which equates to 197,000-405,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

In China, agricultural development at breeding grounds has resulted in wetland destruction and increased disturbance. Egg collection on Sanjiang plain (China), coupled with habitat loss to agricultural development, has probably resulted in a decline in the numbers of breeding Anatidae there of 90% in the last 30 years. Recent droughts on the breeding grounds have resulted in a number of years of poor recruitment (<strong></strong>P. Nikolay <em>in litt. </em>2007). The species is absent from many suitable areas probably as a result of disturbance caused by the use of motor-boats and other high-speed vessels as well as illegal hunting activity (Poyarkov 2005). Hunting of waterfowl remains a serious problem in many parts of China, and is reported to be increasingly so in Mongolia in recent years, where the traditional attitudes that inhibited wildfowl hunting are apparently being deliberately replaced with the notion that wildfowl are a useful food source (Poyarkov 2005). Its wetland wintering grounds are under increasing pressure from development and pollution. The availability of submerged vegetation at Shengjin Lake is being reduced by the expansion of intensive aquaculture, leading to a decline in feeding opportunities (Zhang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). The Three Gorges Dam is also likely to have impacted the productivity of submerged vegetation at Shengjin Lake through changes in the hydrology, with other lakes in the Yangtze River basin likely to have been affected (Fox <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Zhang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).

Fox and Cao Lei <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The concentration of birds at fewer sites in winter renders the population more susceptible to the impacts of pollution, disease, hunting, and the loss and degradation of habitat (T.

It also inhabits the edges of highland lakes, marshes, bog pools, swamps and streams with abundant grassland surroundings. It is rarely found in overgrown areas and does not venture into deep water (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong>. In the central parts of its range it occurs most commonly at altitudes of 2,000-3,000 m in areas with waterlogged black cotton-soils (vertisols) (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. At the northern and southern extremities of its range it occurs at higher altitude where the substrate is granitic and the grasses coarser and longer (Kear 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. <strong>Diet </strong>The species is primarily herbivorous, grazing on grasses, sedges and other herbaceous vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. However it is also reported to take worms, insects, insect larvae, freshwater molluscs and even small reptiles (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong>Breeding Site </strong>The nest is built on the ground concealed amongst vegetation (Soothill and Whitehead 1978)<strong></strong>.  <br/><br/><p></p>","It was not formerly thought to be threatened by hunting as, for religious reasons, it is not traditionally eaten&#160; (Callaghan and Green 1993)<strong></strong>.

They then move short distances to coastal areas in search of suitable habitat for the dry season (Kear 2005b, Young 2006)<strong></strong>. During the breeding season the species occurs in solitary, dispersed pairs<strong></strong>, but during the non-breeding season it is more gregarious and occurs in loose groups of up to 40 individuals (Green <em>et al. </em>1994, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. Pair-bonds may last through consecutive seasons and investment by males is high and involves the protection of the female and young (Young 2006)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds only in seasonally flooded, non-tidal areas dominated by Black Mangrove <em>Avicennia marina</em>, on the landward side of littoral forest (Razafindrajao 2000, Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006, Young 2006, H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007, Safford and Hawkins 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>During its post-breeding moult, during which time it is flightless (Young 2006)<strong></strong>, the species seeks out lakes that are rich in aquatic vegetation<strong></strong>, and in the subsequent dry season it is found in coastal wetland areas of shallow water and nutrient-rich mud<strong></strong>, including saline and brackish areas (Razafindrajao 2000, Kear 2005b, Safford and Hawkins 2013)<strong></strong>. Here it prefers open rather than vegetated wetlands (Young 2006)<strong></strong> and is most often found in coastal mangrove forest, bays, estuaries and shallow saline wetlands just inland of mangroves (tannes), though it can also be found less frequently in marshes, dense deciduous forest, areas of open water and herbaceous savannah, especially where <em>Hyparrhenia</em> and <em>Heteropogon</em> grasses are present (Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. <strong>Diet </strong>Little is known about its diet except during moulting when it feeds on terrestrial and aquatic insects including Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera, in addition to the seeds of various plant families and the leaves and stems of monocotyledons (Kear 2005b)<strong></strong>. It usually feeds by dabbling in the mud while wading (Young 1995, Morris and Hawkins 1998)<strong></strong>. <strong>Breeding Site </strong>Nesting takes place in holes in <em>Avicennia marina</em> mangrove trees that have been created by storm damage or decay (Kear 2005b, Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong><em></em><strong></strong>.  Ducklings fledge at 45-49 days (Young 2006)<strong></strong>.   <p></p>","The species is now extremely threatened throughout its breeding range, by extensive habitat loss and disturbance. The distribution of known sites suggests that the single subpopulation is being fragmented as areas of habitat become unsuitable (Young 2006, H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. The species has limited dispersal capabilities and isolation may result in the loss of genetic diversity (Young 2006)<strong></strong>. Furthermore it is threatened by virtue of being highly specific to a series of habitats - which are themselves threatened - throughout its annual cycle (Razafindrajao 2000)<strong></strong>.  Conversion of shallow, muddy water-bodies to rice cultivation (Young <em>et al</em>. 1993)<strong></strong> has been so widespread on the west coast that in the non-breeding season the species now appears to be confined to the few suitable wetlands that are too saline for rice-growing, i.e. some inland lakes and coastal areas such as estuaries and mudflats (Green <em>et al</em>. 1994, Safford and Hawkins 2013)<strong></strong>. In 2004, during a dry-season survey in Menabe, this species was only found in saline wetlands (Young<em> et al.</em> 2014)<strong></strong>. Pressures on coastal wetlands are exacerbated by the movement of people from the High Plateau to coastal regions, which is driven by the over-exhaustion of land (Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Mangroves are under increasing pressure from prawn-pond construction and timber extraction, which also leads to massively increased hunting (Morris and Hawkins 1998)<strong></strong>. Subsistence hunting during the nesting season and the trapping of moulting birds are major threats (Young 2006)<strong></strong>. It is considered a delicacy by hunters and was found in markets in Sofia in 2011 (H. G. Young <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). In contrast, the breeding site at Ankazomborona is not threatened by aquaculture and there is little pressure from subsistence hunters, though there is some pressure from sport hunters (Razafindrajao <em>et al.</em> 2001)<strong></strong>.  Breeding birds may suffer disturbance from human activity, such as the collection of crabs (Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. The species is potentially in competition for the use of suitable nest-holes with the Comb Duck <em>Sarkidiornis melanotos</em>, parrots <em>Coracopsis</em> species and nocturnal lemurs <em>Lepilemur</em> spp. and <em>Cheirogaleus</em> spp., though lemurs are absent in mangroves (Joiner <em>et al.</em> 2006, Young 2006)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The total population is estimated at 1,500-2,500 individuals (H.

While local scarcity can occur, possibly caused by hunting or fire, the population almost certainly exceeds 10,000 mature individuals and has an extremely large range. The species therefore does approach any of the thresholds for classification as Vulnerable.</p><p></p>","It inhabits grassland, including tussock grassland, <em>Triodia</em> hummock grassland, grassy woodland, low shrublands, and structurally similar artificial habitats, such as croplands and golf-courses. It will also use denser vegetation, when this has been temporarily opened up by recent burning. It lays one, or occasionally two, eggs on the ground, where possible along a boundary between open grasslands and more protective shrubland or woodlands (Marchant and Higgins 1993)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In northern Australia it may disperse widely to follow recently-burnt grounds (J. Woinarski <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","Its widespread historical decline was probably caused by a combination of intensive agriculture, invasion of pastoral land by woody weeds, hunting, changes to fire regimes and predation by the Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes </em><strong></strong>(Harrington <em>et al</em>. 1984, Marchant and Higgins 1993, J. Woinarski <em>in litt</em>. 2007). It readily deserts nests in response to disturbance by humans, sheep or cattle (Marchant and Higgins 1993)<strong></strong>. Pesticides, either directly or indirectly ingested, are also held responsible for local extinctions (Ziembicki and Woinarski 2007)<strong></strong>. The area where it has declined corresponds with the distribution of foxes in Australia, a distribution that may be slowly expanding northwards. Traditional and illegal hunting by people is also considerable and may be contributing to the perceived decline in northern and central Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000)<strong></strong>. Across northern Australia it may be less common in areas invaded by woody weeds. Local increases in abundance have occurred in parts of northern Australia in response to recent clearing (Garnett and Crowley 2000)<strong></strong> and subsequent horticultural development, but this effect may dissipate as agriculture intensifies (J.

Local population size varies strongly with rainfall (Ziembicki and Woinarski 2007)<strong><sup> </sup></strong>making assessment of trends difficult, however population loss in southern Australia is believed to have been largely historical, and the population in the north is thought to be relatively stable. Satellite-tracking has provided substantial information on dispersal in this species, suggesting that populations in higher-rainfall northern Australia undergo relatively local dispersal, whereas those in lower-rainfall areas may undergo far more substantial regional and inter-regional movements (J.

It also occurs in semi-arid scrub and dunes with succulent vegetation, and extends into <em>renosterveld </em>scrub and semi-arid karoo (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). It occurs occasionally in cultivated fields with nearby cover (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005).  The diet consists of insects, small reptiles and plant material, including seeds and green shoots (Hockey <em>et al. </em>2005).","Conversion of natural vegetation to agriculture is likely to be the primary threat. In Overberg and Swartland, where the species has declined, the intensity of agricultural cultivation has increased in recent years (D. Young <em>in litt. </em>2013). Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcounts project data show that, whilst the  species can use farmland where little else is available (especially in  the  Overberg, where c.80% of land is transformed), in general they   prefer natural veld (Hofmeyr 2012). Patches of indigenous vegetation have probably not only decreased in  size but also become more isolated (D. Young <em>in litt. </em>2013). Increasing agricultural activity is likely to not only cause a decrease in suitable breeding territories, but also decreased breeding success as a result of increased  disturbance related to farming activities and increased chick and egg  predation because of a general decrease in cover and an increase in  predators such as Pied Crows (Hofmeyr 2012). It is also possible that adults have suffered increased predation rates and even  increased starvation because of the decline in cover and suitable  habitat (Hofmeyr 2012). Climate change may aggravate the threat of habitat loss (Hofmeyr 2012).","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species has been described as ""uncommon to common"" (Hockey <em>et al. </em>2005).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to southwestern <strong>South Africa</strong>, where it occurs in Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces from Little Namaqualand south to Cape Town and then east to Grahamstown.

In India, the species is increasingly forced to use suboptimal rice paddies as breeding habitat because of the deterioration and destruction of its natural wetland habitat (Meine and Archibald 1996, Sundar 2009). In Australia, cattle pastures and maize stubble are important foraging habitats in the non-breeding season (J. Grant<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It prefers a mixture of flooded, partially flooded and dry ground for foraging, roosting and nesting. It is omnivorous, feeding on a variety of roots and tubers as well as invertebrates and amphibians. In some locations in the Indian subcontinent and in Australia, birds disperse seasonally in response to available water. Breeding in India may take place virtually year-round if conditions are suitable, but there is a major peak in July-October, with egg laying in August-September, and a much smaller peak in February-March (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It breeds during respective wet seasons in South-East Asia and Australia, migrating to key non-breeding sites during the dry season where birds form sizeable aggregations (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In India and Nepal, breeding pairs maintain discrete territories, year-round in areas with an adequate water supply throughout the year, while non-breeding birds are generally found in flocks that use larger wetlands to roost (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Successful breeding pairs generally raise one or two chicks, with three chicks being extremely rare. Flock sizes in India are a function of wetland availability with the largest flocks seen in summers when wetlands are much reduced (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","The main threats are a combination of loss and degradation of wetlands, as a result of drainage and conversion to agriculture (for example wet rice paddy into dry sugarcane or soya bean [Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003]<strong><sup></sup></strong>), ingestion of pesticides (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and the hunting of adults and collection of eggs and chicks (particularly in Indo-China but increasingly in India and Pakistan) for trade, food, medicinal purposes and, in some areas, to help prevent damage to crops (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000, Khacher 2006, K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. These factors may be the cause of low recruitment in India, and can rapidly extirpate localised populations (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Vietnam and Cambodia, large areas of the Mekong Delta, which supported key dry season habitat, have been reclaimed for agriculture in recent decades (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. From 2001 to 2006, much of the seasonally inundated floodplains of the Ha Tien Plain, were lost, mostly due to the expansion of shrimp farms (Tran 2006a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The mechanisation of farming practices may threaten birds breeding on agricultural land (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Collision with powerlines may be a significant threat in parts of its range, with observations from India suggesting that 2.5-20 % of cranes are affected (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000, Sundar and Choudhury 2001)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, mostly non-breeding birds, equating to almost 1% of the total population (Sundar and Choudhury 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. High human usage of wetlands results in a high rate of disturbance to cranes and considerably limits breeding success (Sundar and Choudhury 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Anecdotal observations suggest that chick predation by dogs and egg predation by corvids is increasing as their populations increase following the decline of vultures on the Indian subcontinent (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The vast majority of the Australian population breed and winter in non-protected areas (J. Grant<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the Gulf of Carpentaria region of northern Australia, proposals to increase cropping would entail conversion of land currently grazed by cattle, which is breeding habitat for the species, and would also involve impoundment of water currently available in wetland habitats (J. Grant<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. At Lake Tinaroo, Australia, grazing is forbidden in some areas in the interests of water quality, and such sites have now become overgrown with dense vegetation and abandoned by the species (E. Scambler<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is also threatened by the increasing subdivision of the shoreline grazing land at Lake Tinaroo for residential development, which is accompanied by increasing disturbance, e.g. from the use of speedboats (E. Scambler<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Each year there are one or two reports of individuals killed by powerlines on the Atherton Tableland, although this threat has not been investigated or quantified (E. Scambler<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","There are thought to be 8,000-10,000 individuals in India, Nepal and Pakistan; 800-1,000 in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, 500-800 in Myanmar (unpublished information supplied by Wetlands International Specialist Groups 2006), and about 10,000 breeding adults in Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000, R. Jaensch&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005 to Wetlands International 2006). The population size thus totals 19,000-21,800 individuals, roughly equivalent to 13,000-15,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Antigone&#160;</em><em>antigone</em> has three disjunct populations in the Indian subcontinent, South-East Asia and northern <strong>Australia</strong>, with a total world population estimated at 15,000-20,000 individuals (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. The nominate subspecies (c.8,000-10,000 birds) inhabits northern and central <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Nepal </strong>and<strong> Pakistan </strong>(although now thought to be extinct as a breeding species there [Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003]<strong></strong>), with occasional vagrants in Bangladesh. Its range has contracted towards the north and west of the Subcontinent (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong> and its population is considered to be in decline (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. The north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh remains the species's stronghold, with a population estimated at over 6,000 individuals (Sundar 2008). Subspecies <em>sharpii</em> occurs in South-East Asia where its range has declined dramatically, now being confined to <strong>Cambodia</strong>, extreme southern<strong> Laos</strong>, south <strong>Vietnam</strong> (c.800-1,000 birds between these three countries [Wetlands International 2006]<strong></strong>), and <strong>Myanmar</strong> (c.500-800 birds [Wetlands International 2006]<strong></strong>). Despite past declines, recent counts have shown some increase in the South-East Asian population, however Population Viability Analysis of cranes in Tram Chin shows the population is highly unstable and prone to extinction if current rates of habitat degradation continue (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Since 2001, a coordinated census has been held each year in Cambodia and Vietnam in the late dry season. In 2009, 455 individuals were counted at six sites, around 30% fewer than in the previous year. Early dry season counts (562 individuals), however, were higher than in 2008 (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The Australian population (<em>gilliae</em>) is confined to the north and east of the country. It was estimated at fewer than 10,000 breeding adults in 2000 (Garnett and Crowley 2000, R. Jaensch <em>in litt.</em> 2005 to Wetlands International 2006)<strong></strong>, and has been put as low as 5,000 individuals (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. The highest number recorded in surveys in north Queensland was in October 2000, when an estimated minimum of 3,000 individuals was present on Atherton Tablelands (E.

Scambler<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;During recent years, fluctuations in recruitment and numbers visiting the&#160;Atherton Tablelands&#160;have been noted, and are thought to be related to variation in annual rainfall in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape Regions (J.

A proposed 238,374-ha conservation reserve for the species in the Kampong Trach IBA, Cambodia, was demarcated in 2006, awaiting a ministerial decree (Anon. 2006b)<strong></strong>. Patrols have since been carried out, and environmental education is ongoing in the area (Anon. 2006b)<strong></strong>. Following the discovery of a major non-breeding population in the Basaac river floodplain of the Mekong Delta, in Borei Chulsar and Koh Andeth districts, Takeo province, during surveys in 2001-2002, a workshop was organised and a 9,275-ha protected area was proposed and subsequently went for approval (Anon. 2002)<strong></strong>. In 2003, protection was proposed for Hon Chong grassland (Anon 2003)<strong></strong>. Conservation awareness campaigns have been initiated in India, Nepal, Laos and Cambodia. Nest protection schemes in India have proven successful (Sundar and Choudhury 2003)<strong></strong>. In 2004–2005 protection of 22 nests by volunteer in the Kota district, Rajasthan resulted in the successful fledging of 19 chicks (Kaur <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). National surveys have recently been conducted in India and Cambodia, and detailed studies on species requirements are ongoing in India and Nepal (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In Myanmar, Buddhist monks have increased local respect for cranes and many nests are protected when they would otherwise be destroyed to prevent damage to rice paddies (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Since 1997, annual roost counts have been conducted on the Atherton Tableland in the far north of Queensland during the non-breeding season (E. Scambler<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In 2008 the Atherton Tablelands Important Bird Area was established based on population distribution data from the annual counts, and continuing counts from 2009 monitor the IBA and surrounding sites. Authorities have flagged particular sections of powerline after Sarus Crane deaths or injuries were reported by concerned observers in the IBA. The Australian Crane Network (website http://ozcranes.net/) established in 2005, remains a contact point for crane researchers, landowners and interested individuals, including international networks; and provides updates on ongoing and completed research and conservation issues (E.

It has declined at the majority of these wintering sites. Owing to these factors it is listed as Vulnerable. If there is evidence that the continuing decline in range parameters and or habitat quality has ceased, this species may be considered for down listing to Near Threatened in the future.<p></p>","It breeds in remote, wooded, upland bogs on gently sloping foothills and flat river terraces, mostly within the permafrost zone. It winters in freshwater marshes, wet grassland, coastal tidal flats and farmland. Paddy fields and meadows are commonly used habitat for foraging, though the species has a flexible strategy depending on food availability, with a range of habitats utilised (Zheng <em>et al.</em> 2015). Flock size has been found to be influenced by food availability and level of disturbance (Yang <em>et al. </em>2015) and foraging behaviour is influenced by changes in water levels at Shengjin Lake (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Conversion of rice-paddies to cotton fields at Longgan Hu and Dongting Hu has caused declines. A newly discovered wintering site at Suncheon Bay, South Korea, is threatened by development. The artificially high concentration of birds at Izumi, as a result of supplementary feeding, risks a major population reduction from disease or another catastrophe. &#160;The situation at Izumi is particularly sensitive because the area is a major poultry center so that huge economic interests could be threatened by a disease outbreak. Efforts to disperse Hooded Cranes to other locations has met with small success, and establishment of additional winter sites (together with a reduction in the concentration at Izumi) are considered essential to the species’ security (J. Harris <em>in litt. </em>2016). Other threats in China include pollution of coastal waters, invasive cordgrass<em> Spartina alterniflora </em>in tidal areas, pesticide poisoning, increased levels of human disturbance and over-fishing. Some poaching and hunting of breeding birds occurs but disturbance by geese hunters is a larger issue than direct hunting (W. Heim <em>in litt. </em>2016). A study that took samples from four wintering populations found genetic diversity to be low, and this may influence its ability to adapt to environmental change in the future (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p><p><br/></p><p></p>","<p>The global population was estimated at&#160;c.11,600 individuals based on winter estimates of 1,050-1,150 individuals in China (J.

In the Sundarbans of  Bangladesh all records originate from the fresh and brackish waters with no records from the saltwater zone<strong> </strong>(Gani 2005). Most breeding appears to occur inland while most records are from lowlands, although it has occurred up to 1,220 m on migration. There is an emerging pattern of non-breeding season records in peninsular Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia and breeding season records in continental South-East Asia, with passage migrants observed between these ranges. It has been observed catching freshwater shrimp, large beetles and small fish<strong> </strong>(Shepherd 2006), but feeds mainly by gleaning insects from overhanging vegetation<strong> </strong>(J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2007). The species is generally very shy and retiring but can appear extremely tame and confiding while incubating, rendering it susceptible to human predation<strong> </strong>(Neumann-Denzau 2008).  <p></p>","The main threat is the destruction and increased levels of disturbance to rivers in lowland riverine forest, driven by agricultural clearance and logging operations and increased traffic on waterways. One off incidents may also have affected some populations such as oil spills (D. Simic <em>in litt. </em>2014).&#160;Habitats have been further degraded by the removal of bankside vegetation and changes in hydrology resulting from dam construction, and siltation. Moreover, population declines in areas such as the Sundarbans may be directly or indirectly related to climate change; with the possible effects of climate change including frequent tropical cyclones, a decline in preferred nesting habitat due to lack to suitable trees (effected by salt water intrusion due to sea level rise and reduced freshwater influx), and lower density of prey species due to environmental changes such as saltwater intrusion and cyclone (Chowdhury <em>et al. in prep.</em>). The Sundarbans are further threatened with a proposed 1,320 Megawatt power station to be built 14 km away (Fowlie 2013). Hunting and collection of eggs and chicks have been recorded and although their contribution to population declines is probably minimal this requires clarification<strong> </strong>(Neumann-Denzau 2008); indeed the species is easily caught at the nest making it prey to opportunistic human hunters, with 56% of interviewed fisherman having collected the species (adult, chick or egg) (S.

It also uses reservoirs (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2016).","In southern Thailand, the species is threatened by the casual off-take of eggs and chicks, and potentially by future agricultural intensification in some areas (Wells 1999). Collection of eggs and chicks takes place throughout south-east Asia (W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2016). It is also threatened by incidental disturbance caused by people, livestock and dogs, and is potentially seriously impacted by the multitude of hydroelectric dam projects completed, underway and planned on large rivers in its range, which threaten to alter flow regimes (Thewlis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998, Duckworth<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 1998, 2002, Duckworth and Timmins 2013, F.

Whilst dam construction is likely to have negative impacts on the species, it is difficult to predict the timeframe of these impacts owing to uncertainty around when and if specific dams will be built (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Cambodia, the species is threatened by opportunistic harvesting of eggs by local people, nest predation by crows, rodents, and domestic dogs, trampling of nests by domestic water buffalo, disturbance by people and domestic animals, and flooding of nests and breeding habitat by hydroelectric dams (Claassen 2004, Claassen <em>et al</em>., in press). Populations on the Cambodian stretches of the Sesan and Sekong rivers are threatened by upstream hydropower dams located in Vietnam and Laos. Additionally, there is now a hydropower dam being constructed in Cambodia at the confluence of the Sesan and Srepok rivers which will destroy habitat in the reservoir area, and water releases from the dam will potentially flood nests located downstream. Populations along these rivers will be negatively affected by these developments (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2011, A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;The threats of disturbance and hunting, in Laos at least, are exacerbated by the tendency for both <em>V. duvaucelii</em>  and human settlers to select the same rivers, although the numbers of  the species and frequency of villages are inversely correlated, which  appears to confirm that there are some negative impacts from human  activities (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1998). Prior to construction of the Nam Theun 2 hydropower dam on the Nakai Plateau in central Laos, the River Lapwing population experienced low reproductive success due to disturbance (and probable egg harvesting) by local fishermen; the lapwing population likely completely disappeared once the plateau was converted into a reservoir following completion of the Nam Theun 2 dam (A.

Along the Sangu river in Bangladesh, which may harbour all or most of the country's population of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">V. duvaucelii</span>, the species is subject to on-going hunting pressure, and there is no evidence of successful breeding along surveyed stretches, probably owing to the frequenting of sandbars by people, dogs and corvids (S.

Human persecution may also be a problem in some areas<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Thorstrom and Watson 1997)<strong></strong>. Much of the eastern coastal plain has either already been cleared or is covered by highly degraded forest; remaining habitat is under pressure from the increasing human population (Du Puy and Moat 1996)<strong></strong>.

It nests in low vegetation or on the ground in marshes (Morris and Hawkins 1998, Rene de Roland <em>et al.</em> 2004, 2009)<strong></strong>. Breeding has been recorded as starting in late August and September, during the middle of the dry season (Rene de Roland <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>.

Nestlings are often taken by people for food, and interviews with local communities have revealed that adults are also hunted for food (Anon. 2007, Rene de Roland <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. The species is also persecuted because of its threat to poultry, however, in one study of breeding birds, domestic chickens accounted for only 1% of prey items (Rene de Roland <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. The disturbance of marshes appears to limit the number of breeding pairs present, and human activities during the cultivation period may force the movement of birds.

It tends to avoid open water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), being most often found in areas where there is ample cover of short, emergent vegetation (Dowsett 1981, Martínez-Vilalta and Motis 1992) such as <em>Cynodon dactylon</em> and <em>Panicum repens</em> (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). The availability of this habitat is increased by fire and high grazing pressure, however there has so far been insufficient data to confirm important links between these factors and the species's abundance, although it has been observed to be more abundant on burnt floodplains, and it often occurs in association with Red Lechwe <em>Kobus leche</em> (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). It forages in water less than 10 cm in depth (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <em>Breeding</em> It breeds in temporary wetlands at the time of - or shortly after - maximum water levels (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Its preferred breeding habitat is <em>Phragmites</em> reedbed (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a), but it will also nest on islands of vegetation such as water figs <em>Ficus verruculosa</em>, <em>Acacia</em> spp. (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a, Reed 2006) and date (tsaro) palms <em>Phoenix reclinata </em>(Atkinson 2003<strong></strong>, Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006b).<strong> Diet </strong>When possible it feeds mainly on young fish (Dowsett 1981, Mathews and McQuaid 1983), especially cichlids (Hancock 2006c)<strong></strong>, but in temporary wetlands where fish do not occur, its diet consists of frogs, aquatic invertebrates (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a, 2006c)<strong></strong> and tadpoles (Mathews and McQuaid 1983<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,&#160;</span>Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Tyler 2005, Hancock 2006c<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>. It locates prey by sight in clear, shallow water (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a, 2006c)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Additionally it will glean snails from lily pads and uses ""standing flycatching"" to catch dragonflies and other insects (Mathews and McQuaid 1983, Kushlan and Hancock 2005<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>).&#160;<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>It forages diurnally, often in association with other heron and wader species (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).<strong> Breeding Site </strong>The nest is a bowl lined with fine plant material (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006b), usually on a platform constructed from sticks, and the species shows high nest-site fidelity (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Clutch size has been recorded as 1-4 eggs, with a mean of 2.4 (n = 16) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a, 2006b)<strong></strong>, and the incubation period in one nest was recorded as 22-24 days<strong></strong> (Hancock 2006a).<strong> </strong> <p></p>","The wetlands inhabited by this species face many threats, including flood regulation (P. Leonard <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, water abstraction, land-claim for agriculture (S. J. Tyler <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, reed-cutting (through disturbance and burning) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a), fire (Randall and Herremans 1994)<strong></strong>, rice production and disturbance from tourists (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). It is known to have disappeared from part of the Kafue Flats due to flood control by humans, which involved damming the Kafue River (Tyler 2005<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span> Kushlan and Hancock 2005)<strong></strong>. At the Okavango Delta (Botswana) food availability appears to be limited and any decrease would impact the survival of adult and immature birds (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). The aerial spraying of Deltamethrin to eradicate tsetse flies has not had any discernible impact on populations as yet (Hancock 2008), despite being known to affect small fish and aquatic invertebrates (Hancock 2006b)<strong></strong>. The presence of <em>Salvinia molesta</em> in some areas reduces visibility by covering the water surface and probably affects foraging by the species (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Breeding success is erratic, and can be significantly affected by human interference, poor floods and predation of nests and adults (Martínez-Vilalta and Motis 1992, Randall and Herremans 1994,<strong> </strong>R. E. Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 1999). In Botswana, two major historical breeding sites in reedbeds have been destroyed by human-induced fire and their regeneration prevented by decreased flood levels, whilst other sites have suffered human disturbance (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Feeding and trampling by elephants <em>Loxodonta africana</em>, which have expanded their range since the moratorium on elephant hunting, and to a lesser extent buffalo <em>Syncerus caffer</em>, renders reedbeds and trees unsuitable for nesting (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Productivity may be limited by high levels of predation by raptors and other species at some colonies (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). The species may also be threatened by climate change in the long term (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a).  <p></p>","A population estimate of 3,000-5,000 individuals follows new surveys and replaces Collar and Stuart's (1985) estimate of 5,000-10,000 individuals.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<B>Behaviour</B> The movements of this species are little known (Hockey <I>et al.</I> 2005, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), although it is thought to be sedentary, sometimes making local movements in response to seasonal rainfall and the appearance of temporary shallow-water feeding areas (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, del Hoyo<I> et al</I>. 1992, Hockey <I>et al.</I> 2005, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds at the start of the rainy season and in periods of flooding when shallow feeding sites develop (del Hoyo<I> et al</I>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It typically breeds in densities of 5 to 50 or up to 100 nests scattered throughout a single- or mixed-species colony.

It is usually seen alone, sometimes with other herons (Langrand 1990). It breeds mainly in small groups of a few pairs in mixed species colonies but also solitarily (Langrand 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Koenig 2012). Various independent observations suggest that nesting takes place year-round (Langrand 1990, ZICOMA 1999, Andrianarimisa <em>et al.</em> in press). There are observations of Grey Heron <em>Ardea cinerea</em> and <em>A. humbloti</em> chicks occupying the same nests; though there is no evidence of mixed pairings or hybridisation, and this interaction between the two species is not understood  (Andrianarimisa <em>et al.</em> in press). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species prefers coastal areas (including coral islets, mangroves, tidal mud flats and estuaries) (Hancock and Elliott 1978, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), but also frequents freshwater lakes (particularly those that persist through the dry season and are in close proximity to other lakes [Andrianarimisa <em>et al.</em> in press]), rivers and, more rarely, rice-paddies (Hancock and Elliott 1978, <strong></strong>Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It forages in clear, shallow waters (Hancock and Elliott 1978, Langrand 1990) and among floating vegetation (Hancock and Elliott 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Habitat suitability depends on water clarity, shoreline areas with shallow water and the availability of large fish  (Andrianarimisa <em>et al.</em> in press). <strong>Diet </strong>It feeds chiefly on medium to large fish (up to 20 cm [del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992]) and crustaceans (Langrand 1990, Morris and Hawkins 1998). <strong>Breeding Site</strong> It nests in tree-tops or hollows in rocks, and has also been reported to nest on the ground (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

Chicks generally stay in natal territories until the subsequent breeding season, although they stay longer if adult birds do not breed in the subsequent year (Sundar 2003)<span lang=""EN-AU"">, although early dispersal of young was found in New South Wales, Australia, with some birds dispersing within a few months of fledging but others persisting in the territory until at least the next breeding season (Clancy &amp; Ford 2013). &#160;Although the process of laying and raising chicks to independence takes up to 12 months, ten out of 25 pairs that bred successfully in one year, were also successful in the subsequent year (Clancy and Ford 2013).<p></p></span></span></span></span></span>","It is threatened by a variety of factors across its range, including drainage of wetlands, felling of nest trees, development, encroachment of agriculture or aquaculture, overfishing, overgrazing, hunting and excessive capture for zoos. Consecutive years of drought can cause declines in the population (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> Family CICONIIDAE 1992),&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">though one population in western Uttar Pradesh is resilient to dry years as long as these are interspersed with years of normal and above-normal rainfall (Sundar 2011a). In India, the freshwater wetlands that this species relies upon are under great pressure from expanding human populations (Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004). The most frequent threat to the species in this country is fishing (Santiapillai<em> et al. </em>1997, Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004), which is so intensive in places that even 5-10 cm fishes are taken (Rahmani 1987), followed by the affects of sedimentation on wetland quality (Maheswaran <em>et al. </em>2004).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Illegal conversions of erstwhile community-use wetlands to private fish ponds has severe and large-scale impacts on populations (Sundar <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;However, deterioration of foraging habitat through the conversion of wetlands into agricultural fields is also a major threat in India (Rahmani 1987, Maheswaran 2003a, Sundar 2004, Sundar&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">2011a). In the face of wetland conversions, flooded rice paddies have become important and may be promoting the dispersal of young birds and preventing the fragmentation of sub-populations (Sundar 2004). Eggs are taken in at least some parts of India (Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004). Disturbance during the nesting season is a major threat (Rahmani 1987), &#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">but at least one population in Uttar Pradesh has very high breeding success despite being in a human-dominated agricultural landscape (Sundar 2011a). Traditional mechanisms of conservation of trees (nesting habitat) and wetlands (foraging habitat) combined with legal provisions, and cultivation using low levels of mechanisation in rural India can provide suitable conditions for this species (Sundar 2011a).&#160;Deaths due to collision with electricity wires are occasional in India (Sundar 2005),&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">but are the main cause (c.50%) of deaths of birds of all ages in Australia.&#160;&#160; Death from apparent natural causes and unknown causes were the next equal highest category.&#160; There were only 4 deaths known from collision with wire fences in Australia (Clancy&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016). Additional threats in Sri Lanka include possible inbreeding in small populations, pesticide poisoning of wetlands and loss of mangroves to increasing salinity levels (Santiapillai <em>et al.</em> 1997). In Australia, the species is thought to be threatened by disturbance and habitat loss, but has not been greatly affected by the intensification of land-use in eastern Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000,&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">Clancy &amp; Kingsford 2015). Sea-level rise is projected to have a negative impact upon coastal habitats. The frequent formation of mostly female-biased trios in Australia may indicate that the sex ratio of the species is skewed (Sundar <em>et al. </em>2006).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Large remnant trees are being replaced by plantations, particularly in the New South Wales region, and could lead to declines in prime nesting habitat (Clancy and Ford 2011).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Agro-industry farming is an ongoing threat with very rapid declines suspected for the minority of populations. This has however now been seen to be untrue for at least one population that has over 30 breeding pairs (G. Sundar <em>in litt. </em>2016). Drought due to climate change may be a threat, but modelling shows that as long as there are years of normal and above-normal rainfall interspersed with drought years, populations will do well (Sundar 2011a). Improper management of some man-made protected areas in India (for example, Keoladeo National Parin in Rajasthan) has failed to provide adequate environment for this species (G. Maheswaran <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p></span></span></span></span>","There are thought to be 1,000 <em>asiaticus </em>(G.

In light of the uncertainty surrounding this figure, a conservative range estimate of 15,000-35,000 individuals is preferred.",Decreasing,"<em>Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus </em>occurs in South Asia, South-East Asia and Oceania. In South Asia it is found in <strong>Pakistan</strong> (previously frequent in lower Sind, breeding in the Indus delta until the 1970s, now a straggler), <strong>Nepal</strong> (rare resident and winter visitor to the <em>terai</em>), <strong>India</strong> (a widespread resident, but now generally rare and local, and may now be absent in many areas in the south [G.

However, a population of c.29 pairs studied in Uttar Pradesh (India) had high productivity and low mortality and has been judged to be at least stable, if not a source for neighbouring populations (Sundar 2003, 2011a). The districts of south-western Uttar Pradesh are the species stronghold in India (K.S.G. Sundar<em> in litt. </em>2007). Between 1996 and 2003, the species was judged to be in decline at 32 (54%) of the 59 sites in India where it was recorded (Maheswaran <em>et al. </em>2004).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In Dudwa N.P. the population remains the same even after 20 years when Maheswaran visited the wetlands situated inside Dudwa as recently as May, 2016.

A recent estimate places the Australian population at up to 20,000 breeding individuals and secure, although it has been contested that this is unduly optimistic and that the figure may not exceed 10,000. These estimates have been used to extrapolate a global total of c.31,000 individuals (Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>.

As well as fruits and berries, the species feeds on eggs, young birds, insects and carrion (Faike 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Captive-reared birds have been observed using twigs as tools to access food (Faike 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Nest construction usually begins in March and the first clutches are laid in April (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","It has suffered from extensive habitat alteration, particularly reduction of understory food-plants as a result of the activities of feral ungulates, logging, agriculture and the loss of pollinators and dispersers (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Problematic ungulates include feral cattle, mouflon sheep, feral sheep and goats (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The impact of shooting has probably been substantial, even in recent decades. In the late 19th Century, the species was persecuted as a pest, and it became unpopular with pig hunters for alerting animals to their presence (Faike 2006)<strong></strong>. The species was confiding and easily attracted by imitated calls, making it an easy target (Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

The captive population is inbred (Faike 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, and this may be reducing reproductive success. West Nile Virus, which could potentially be introduced by migrating shorebirds and waterfowl or commercial transport, and is spread by mosquitoes (Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, could threaten reintroduction efforts in the future. West Nile Virus is presumed to be highly lethal in <em>C. hawaiiensis</em>, owing to a reduction in the population of the American Crow <em>C. brachyrhynchos</em> in mainland North America by 45% over eight years due to the virus (J.

Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1999 (Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009).

It is listed as Near Threatened on the basis that it occupies a tiny range and remains susceptible to stochastic events and the impacts of introduced species, such that it could qualify as threatened within one or two generations.<br/><p></p>","It is a territorial insectivore adapted to dense thickets in remaining, largely exotic, vegetation. The low intensity of vegetation cutting by humans appears to promote such dense growth. In 1999, a survey found 78% of the population in habitat dominated by introduced jamrosa <em>Syzygium jambos </em>where the highest densities (2.3 individuals/ha) are found (Showler 1999)<strong></strong>. The species is also known at lower densities (0.5/ha) in plantations of <em>Swietenia</em>, <em>Tabebuia</em> and <em>Araucaria</em> sp. However other factors, incompletely understood, greatly influence its distribution as demonstrated by the areas of apparently suitable habitat as yet uncolonised (Showler <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong></strong>. Restored native forests were found to support the highest densities of the species (Steward 2010). It may breed in groups, as while it usually breeds in pairs there is one report of 4 individuals on a territory, with 3 helping at the nest (Cheke 1987). It lays 3-5 eggs, with the main breeding season September to March (Safford 2013), although only 1-2 chicks may be successfully raised (Safford 2013).<br/><p></p>","Timber harvesting, subsistence farming and feral livestock have reduced the native habitat to savanna with scattered trees. Currently, the main threat is predation and/or competition from introduced animals such as rats and feral cats (Showler <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong></strong>. Sustained periods of drought (reducing invertebrate levels), cyclones, and the destruction and further degradation of remaining suitable habitat are additional problems (Showler <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong></strong>. It has survived alongside the Black Rat <em>Rattus rattus</em> for a long time (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, but nest predation by this species was believed to be a major factor suppressing its population recovery (Showler <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong></strong>. In addition, the fledging success of undisturbed nests appears low, possibly due to food availability (Showler <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Human disturbance may be an additional problem at some localities (Showler 1999)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","In 1999, the population was estimated to be no fewer than 150 individuals, and it remained at this level until 2004 at least (A.

Its small, fragmented population is consequently presumed to be declining. <p></p>","This species is a group-territorial, cooperative breeder (Shaw and Musina 2003b<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>). In June-July, following the end of the long rains, groups typically comprise 3-4 adults, often accompanied by 1-2 fledglings or immatures (Shaw and Musina 2003b). It occurs in two contrasting habitats: thickets and woodland within semi-arid areas (e.g. Machakos and Mwea); and moist, fertile land largely cleared for agriculture, but with fragments of scrub, mainly of the exotic shrub <em>Lantana camara</em> (Mukurweini and Kianyaga) (Njoroge and Mutinda 1996, Njoroge <em>et al.</em> 1998, Shaw and Musina 2003b). In both situations they are normally found in close proximity to dense vegetation associated with streams and rivers, and are more abundant in higher rainfall (perhaps more invertebrate rich) areas that have retained some thicket cover (Njoroge <em>et al.</em> 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span> Njoroge and Bennun 2000, Shaw and Musina 2003b<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>. Similarly, changes in the species’ distribution at these two sites during 2000–2011 were positively correlated with changes in scrub cover. Within 1-km transect sections the loss of a babbler group was associated with a reduction in scrub cover of 22 percentage points (Shaw et al. 2014). At Mukurweini and Kianyaga, abundance was found to increase where thicket cover exceeded 3%, while breeding success improved where thicket cover exceeded 9% (Shaw and Musina 2003b<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>). Nest records peak in March to May and September to October, coinciding with the main periods of rainfall (Shaw and Musina 2003b<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>). Clutches of 2-3 eggs are laid in nests built at 1-3 m, usually in thickets (Njoroge and Mutinda 1996). Productivity generally appears similar to its congeners, with fledglings and immatures together accounting for about 16% to 20% of birds aged during surveys between 2000 and 2011 respectively (Shaw and Musina 2003b<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>, Kamiti 2003, Shaw <em>et al. </em>2014).  <p></p>","A rapidly increasing human population and intensive farming within its range mean that remaining patches of thicket are being cleared rapidly, with little land left fallow or unweeded, and the thickets that remain are becoming increasingly fragmented (Njoroge <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Thickets may also have been destroyed by rice irrigation and dams along the Tana River. Loss of thicket may have been partly mitigated by the spread of the exotic <em>Lantana camara</em>, which provides thicket cover in previously cleared areas. Its presence has probably slowed the species's decline, and may even have enabled it to colonise or re-colonise intensively farmed land (Njoroge and Bennun 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Disturbance during the breeding season may result in low breeding success (Njoroge and Mutinda 1996, Njoroge <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Inbreeding and competition from Northern Pied-babblers <em>T. hypoleucus</em> do not appear to be threats to this species, although formerly suspected as such (Njoroge <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. However, hunting for food is a serious threat in some areas (e.g. Kianyaga) (Njoroge and Mutinda 1996, Njoroge and Bennun 2000<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>). Other potential threats are pesticide use, predation, brood parasitism (from Jacobin Cuckoo <em>Clamator jacobinus</em>) and low genetic diversity (P.

Yellow crazy ants are established on many islands including Mangareva and Turea both of which are departure islands for several islands inhabited by the Tuamotu Sandpiper (Pierce <em>et al.</em> 2015). Meanwhile, the establishment of coconut <em>Cocos nucifera </em>plantations is thought not to be a threat unless native undergrowth is also cleared (Pierce and Blanvillain 2004)<strong></strong>  or outcompeted by seedlings when plantations are not harvested (M. H. Burle<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2012).

95970132,12303,Lontra felina,Endangered,A2cd+3cde,2021,2020-01-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Marine Otter is confirmed as Endangered on the basis of inferred  future population decline due to habitat loss and exploitation.  Historical records suggest that the species was abundant until the 19th  century (Tschudi 1844, Darwin 1889), when there occurred a steep decline  in population due to hunting for pelt trade. The species has a  restricted distribution along the Pacific coast from northern Peru along  the Chilean coast to Cape Horn and Isla de Los Estados in Argentina. It  is patchily distributed from Peru to Tierra del Fuego. Its distribution  north of 39°S latitude is becoming highly fragmented because of  exploitation, pollution and increased human occupation along the  seashores. Poaching is still present in many regions, especially south  of 39ºS latitude, where there is little or no enforcement of protective  legislation. The greatest threats to its continuous existence are  accelerating habitat destruction, degradation, and competition for prey,  accidental kill in crab pots and poaching throughout the range. The  original range of Marine Otter has decreased considerably because of  excessive hunting (Redford and Eisenberg 1992), and the species has been  nearly exterminated from the regions of Cape Horn and southern Tierra  del Fuego (Brownell 1978) as well as from the northern extremities of  its former range (Chehebar 1990).<br/><br/>Additionally, Marine Otters are  persecuted and killed directly for alleged damage to local fish,  bivalves, and shrimp populations (Miller <em>et al.</em> 1983, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Apaza <em>et al.</em>  2004).) Illegal fishing techniques (e.g. dynamite fishing, accidental  death by entanglement (bycatch) in fishing nets) are a frequent problem  in several localities of the Peruvian coast, such as Huarmey (Valqui  2012) and Paracas (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Valqui 2012). Pollution of  the Marine Otter's habitat comes from several centres of industrial  fishing activity like Chimbote (probably the most important fishing port  at the Peruvian coast) and mining cities Ite, Ilo and Marcona in Peru,  where tailings have been spilled directly into the ocean for over 40  years, altering several kilometres of the littoral zone (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>A  common denominator for all regions is that there is very lenient law  enforcement regarding the Marine Otter's conservation status and  protection, as hunting or killings on fish farms do not implicate  consequences to the offenders. Global natural factors like the El Niño  Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also may considerably affect the marine  otter population (Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2010), due to the more or less  drastic climatic and oceanographic changes that cause the mortality of  several marine communities from fish to mammals (Apaza and Figari 1999,  Wang and Fiedler 2006).<br/><br/>Based on the records of historical  decline in population due to extensive hunting for the pelt trade, the  species can be categorised as Endangered under criteria A2cd, due to a  suspected decline in population of ≥ 50% over the past three  generations, or 30 years (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). The ongoing  threats, such as poaching, habitat loss, retaliatory killings, and  accidental mortalities, are suspected to result in future population  reductions of ≥50% over the next three generations (30 years Pacifici <em>et al.</em>  2013) unless conservation measures are strengthened. Therefore, the  Marine Otter is listed under the category Endangered based on criteria  A2cd+3cde.</p>","<em>Lontra felina</em> is the only species of the genus <em>Lontra </em>that is found exclusively in marine habitats. The species is more agile in water as compared to land. It uses coastlines with range extending approximately 30 m inland and 100–150 m of sea offshore (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979). The species inhabits marine areas exposed to heavy seas and strong wind (Cabello 1978, Ostfeld <em>et al.</em> 1989) and prefers rocky shores with caves that are above the water level at high tide, as well as areas with large algae communities offering an abundance and diversity of prey species (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979). Sandy beaches offer marginal habitat (Sielfeld 1989) and typically are used only for travel between dens and water (Ebensperger and Castilla 1992). Marine Otters are, for the most part, restricted to marine waters, but may occasionally travel up freshwater rivers in search of prey (Brownell 1978, Cabello 1978, Redford and Eisenberg 1992). Because not all coastlines are suitable, marine otters are found in disjunct populations throughout their distribution range (Redford and Eisenberg 1992).<br/> <br/> The fact that Marine Otters are solitary or only gathering in small groups suggests high ecological requirements regarding space. The species' preference for coastal waters offering a wide abundance and diversity of prey species (Castilla and Bahamondes 1979) is in conflict with the increasing artisan and industrial fishing effort. Marine Otters are top predators with a high metabolic rate, thus pollution of their environments may affect them more than other species, as their position in the food chain leads to high bioaccumulation of heavy metals, pesticides and other toxic elements.<br/> <br/> The Marine Otter diet is composed mostly of invertebrates, including crustaceans (decapods, shrimps, and crabs) and molluscs (bivalves and gastropods), and vertebrate prey, including fish belonging to the families Blennidae, Cheilodactylidae, Gobiesocidae, and Pomacentridae, and occasionally birds and small mammals (Cabello 1978, Castilla and Bahamondes 1979, Ostfeld <em>et al</em>. 1989, Sielfeld 1990). Along the Valdivian coast in the south of Chile the diet of marine otter consisted of 25 species; 52% (13/25) of the species identified were crustaceans, 40% (10/25) were fish, and 8% (2/25) were molluscs. Crustaceans were found in 78% of 475 spraints, 100% of 929 prey remains, and 90.8% of prey determined by direct observation, fish in 20% of spraints and 9.0% of prey determined by direct observation, and molluscs in 2% of spraints and 0.2% of prey determined by direct observation. Observed seasonal variation in prey availability was reflected in the otter diet. Fourteen prey species were trapped; 43% (6/14) crustaceans and 57% (8/14) fish. Crustaceans were 93% of 566 trapped individuals, fish 7%. <em>L. felina</em> showed opportunistic feeding behaviour, selecting prey seasonally according to their availability rather than to their energy input (Medina-Vogel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;<br/> <br/> Some studies have found that fruits (<em>Greigia sphacelata</em>, <em>Fascicularia bicolor</em>) may also be consumed occasionally (Brownell 1978, Cabello 1978, Medina 1995). Marine Otters may compete with gulls (<em>Larus</em>) and the South American Sea Lion (<em>Otaria flavescens</em>) for similar species of prey fish (Cabello 1978). The most important natural predator of the Marine Otter is the Killer Whale (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Cabello 1978), but adults also may be killed by sharks (Parera 1996) and birds of prey may capture juveniles when on land (Cabello 1983). <br/> <br/> The Marine Otter is most likely a monogamous species. Mating typically occurs during December or January (Cabello 1978) with gestation of 60-65 days (Housse 1953, Sielfield 1989). Parturition usually occurs from January to March. It takes place in a den or on shore between rocky outcroppings and vegetation. The litter size varies from two to four young, with two being observed most frequently. Young Marine Otters remain with their parents for approximately ten months. Adults transport their young by carrying them in their mouths or resting the young on their bellies as they swim on their backs. Both adults in the monogamous pair bring prey back to the den to feed their young (Parera 1996). During non-breeding season, Marine Otters are mostly solitary. The group size is seldom more than two to three individuals. Its activity pattern is generally diurnal, with peaks of activity noted in early morning, mid-afternoon, and evenings.","<p>Hunting was the major threat on the Marine Otter in the 20th Century  (Sielfeld and Castilla 1999). 38,000 otter pelts were exported from  Chile between 1910 and 1954 (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986). Although two  otter species (<em>L. provocax</em> and <em>L. felina</em>) were subsumed as “otters” and  no hunting estimate of each species can be inferred from this data,  these numbers show the magnitude of the pelt industry in the 20th  Century. Today, the lack of demand in the pelt market and fur trade  prohibitions, have diminished this threat considerably. Nonetheless,  illegal hunting for fur and trophies still occur in some areas as  Samanco, (Sánchez and Ayala 2006), La Libertad (15°29'S) and Morro Sama  (18°00'S) (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004), Peru and south of 39°S latitude in Chile.<br/><br/>In  the last decades, the major threats derive from an intensive  urbanization of western South America, where the immense anthropogenic  pressure on the coastal ecosystem accelerates habitat degradation and  increases its fragmentation (Brownell 1978, Eisenberg and Redford 1989,  Sielfield and Castilla 1999, Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2008, Vianna <em>et al.</em>  2010). It is not yet clear at what point these fragmentation forces  will cause isolation to result in local extinction events due to lack of  gene flow (Valqui 2012). In any case, these global changes will trigger  much more localized threats in different regions. In and around human  settlements, big dens with terrestrial entrances may be occupied by  dogs, cats and rats, displacing the Marine Otter from its reproduction,  feeding and resting areas (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2003, Valqui 2012). Dog attacks are increasingly reported in several locations of the distribution (Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2008, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2010, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Industrial  and artisan fishing ports have been established along the Pacific  coast, affecting structure and productivity of marine life communities.  Although <em>Lontra felina</em> shows certain capacity to coexist with humans,  for example in fishing ports (Valqui 2004, Ruiz 2009, Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em>  2007), fishing has intensified global natural declines in the abundance  of many forage fishes, leading to reduced reproductive success and  reduced abundance of birds and marine mammals (Majluf <em>et al.</em>  2002). The human-otter coexistence implies competition for resources  that humans exploit for food, commerce and housing (Moreno <em>et al.</em> 1984; Ostfeld <em>et al.</em> 1989; Moreno 2001; Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2004, 2007, 2008), as it is the case of mariculture (crabs and molluscs (Apaza <em>et al.</em>  2004). Additionally, the species may be persecuted and killed directly  for alleged damage to local fish, bivalves, and shrimp populations,  which are of consumptive value (Miller <em>et al.</em> 1983, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Apaza <em>et al.</em>  2004).). Illegal fishing techniques (e.g. dynamite fishing) are a  frequent problem in several localities of the Peruvian coast, such as  Huarmey (Valqui 2012) and Paracas (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Valqui 2012). Industrial ships have frequently been observed fishing closer to the coast than allowed by law (Apaza <em>et al.</em>  2004), perturbing the coastal habitat on a broader scale. Another  threat for Marine Otters is accidental death by entanglement (bycatch)  in fishing nets (Brownell 1978, Mangel and Alfaro-Shigueto 2004, Pizarro  2008) and in crab pots (Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2004), although the dimension of these mortality cases is unknown.<br/><br/>Pollution  of the Marine Otter´s habitat comes from several centres of industrial  fishing activity like Chimbote (probably the most important fishing port  at the Peruvian coast) and mining cities Ite, Ilo and Marcona in Peru,  where tailings have been spilled directly into the ocean for over 40  years, altering several kilometres of the littoral (Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Additionally,  spills of domestic effluents reach the ocean directly or indirectly,  through rivers (Hinrichsen 1998, Thorne-Miller 1999). Thus, heavy metals  and other toxic substances can be diffused through currents and  progressively transmitted through the food chain at least in a regional  level (Valqui 2004, Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004). Oil spillage and extreme  noise affect the species in areas near beach resorts in the vicinity of  big cities (Valqui 2004).<br/><br/>A common denominator for all regions is  that there is very law enforcement regarding the Marine Otter´s  conservation status and protection, as hunting or killings on fish farms  do not implicate consequences to the offenders.<br/><br/>Global natural  factors like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also may  considerably affect the Marine Otter population (Vianna <em>et al.</em>  2010), due to the more or less drastic climatic and oceanographic  changes that cause the mortality of several marine communities from fish  to mammals (Apaza and Figari 1999, Wang and Fiedler 2006).</p>","<p>The density estimates proposed by various authors are variable (from 0.04 to 10 individuals per kilometre, see Castilla and Bahamondes 1979, Castilla 1982, Cabello 1983, Rozzi and Torres-Mura 1990, Ebensperger and Castilla 1991, Sanchez 1992, Sielfeld 1992, Medina-Vogel 1995, Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mangel and Alfaro-Shigueto 2004, Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2006), therefore the reported numbers are to be taken with care. Survey numbers and abundance estimations are highly dependent on the methodology applied (Valqui 2012) and detecting individuals on the rocky shores is very difficult. The fact that the species is solitary or only present in very small groups (not larger than ten individuals) makes it difficult to determine if the species is abundant in one specific area. Nevertheless, a global population of about 800 to 2,000 individuals is proposed for the Peruvian coast (<em>ca</em>&#160;150 km) by Valqui (2012).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Marine Otter is distributed along the southern Pacific Coast of  South America from Chimbote (9°S) in northern Peru (Valqui 2012), to  Isla Grevy (56°S) at the southern tip of Chile (Sielfeld 1997) and  eastwards to the Isla de los Estados (54°S), in Argentina (Parera 1996).  In 1964, Schweigger reported Lontra felina up to the Isla Lobos de  Tierra (6° 26'S) in northern Peru. Studies of the last decades  registered the northern range limit at Chimbote (9°S) (Brack 1978,  Brownell 1978, Larivière 1998, Apaza <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sánchez and Ayala 2006, Valqui <em>et al.</em>  2010). Recent sightings in Huanchaco (8°S) suggest at least occasional  events of recolonization north to the actual northern limit of  distribution range, yet reasons for appearance or disappearance in these  areas remain unclear (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al.</em> 2011). In the south  the species´ presence is unclear in the XVth, Ist, XIth and XIIth  regions and in the Tierra del Fuego region in Argentina (Cassini 2008).<br/><br/>Although  Redford and Eisenberg (1992) stated that the original range of Lontra  felina has decreased considerably because of excessive hunting in the  past decades, the authors do not mention any specific regions or study  cases. Brownell (1978) stated that the species has been nearly  exterminated from the regions of Cape Horn and southern Tierra del Fuego  but several works (Sielfeld 1989, 1990, 1992; Sielfeld and Castilla  1999) reported the species' presence between 49°S (Puerto Orella) and  55°S (Isla Grevy).<br/><br/>The Marine Otter´s habitat is naturally  fragmented in a very heterogeneous alternation of suitable habitat  (rocky shore patches with caves or, sometimes, docks, shipwrecks or  abandoned fishing boats) and unsuitable habitat (sandy beaches or rocky  shoreline without caves). Thus, Marine Otters may be absent in several  hundreds of kilometres of coast throughout the species´ total  distribution range (Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2010, Valqui 2012).</p>",For Use and Trade information see under Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The Marine Otter is protected in Argentina, Chile, and Peru.

Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa. A continuing population decline of at least 10% in a&#160;90 year three generation period,&#160;is anticipated based on continuing and increasing anthropogenic threats (Vulnerable C1).<br/><br/>The African Manatee therefore qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>West and Central Africa contain a variety of suitable habitats for Manatees ranging from large and small rivers, coastal estuaries, freshwater and saltwater lagoons, shallow quiet coastal bays, lakes and reservoirs. Like <em>T. manatus</em>, <em>T. senegalensis</em> inhabits practically every accessible habitat (Powell 1996, Dodman <em>et al.</em> 2008). They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Loémé, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake Léré and Lake de Tréné (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: Digboué Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, Ebrié Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, N’gowe (Iguela) Lagoon, N’dogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

97416755,4967,Glyptemys muhlenbergii,Critically Endangered,A2cd+4ce,2011,2010-08-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Bog Turtle, <em>Glyptemys muhlenbergii</em>, has lost the great majority of its suitable habitat in historic and recent times It has suffered further impact from past collection for the pet trade, fragmentation and degradation of remaining habitats, and possibly roadkill and increased predation rates; while emergence of epidemic disease, and climatic change, are recent developments of unknown but potentially severe future impact. Detailed quantitative range-wide estimates are not available, but overall reduction is likely to have exceeded 80% of habitat and 90% of individuals over the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with declines stabilized in many but not all sites at present, and only localized population increases. Due to the species’ highly fragmented occurrence in habitats subject to vegetational succession, intensive management is needed to retain existing populations; creation of alternative sites is challenging; and the species’ low reproductive output (on average under four eggs/year per mature female) and relatively late maturity (about six years) means recovery is a slow gradual process at best. </p>  Based on available data, the Bog Turtle is on the boundary between Endangered and Critically Endangered, since the generation time and thus assessment period are uncertain; at a generation time of 15 years (likely a severe underestimate), an 80% decline in total number of individuals over the past three generations (A2), as well as the past two plus the next generation (A4), appears realistic, qualifying the species as Critically Endangered by criteria A2cd and A4ce.","<em>Glyptemys muhlenbergii</em> is a near-exclusive inhabitant of marsh and swamp habitat away from large water bodies; typical habitats include stream-head sedge meadows, spring-fed sphagnum bogs, fens, and open shrubby swamps, and nearby small streams. In contrast to its vernacular name, the Bog Turtle generally avoids strongly acidic bogs (pH &lt;5.5). As Ernst and Lovich (2009) noted, these are often ecologically ephemeral habitats due to vegetation succession. Bog Turtles have small home ranges, at the order of fractions of a hectare, but moderate-distance movements have been reported travelling both overland and using small streams (Carter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000, Pittmann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).   <p>Bog Turtles are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on a great variety of invertebrate and small vertebrate animal prey as well as seeds, fruits and occasionally other parts of a range of herbs, grasses, sedges and shrubs (see review by Ernst and Lovich 2009). </p>  <p>Bog Turtles can reach up to 11.5 cm carapace length (CL) in males, and 9.6 cm CL in females. Size and age at maturity has been reported as about 7–8 cm CL and 4–6 years in males, and half a cm larger and likely a year later in females. Females normally produce a single clutch of 3–4 (range 1–6) eggs; not all females reproduce in any given year. Hatchlings measure on average 26–28 mm CL. Longevity may exceed 30 years; generation time has not been calculated (see review by Ernst and Lovich 2009). </p>","<p>Much Bog Turtle habitat has been destroyed by drainage and conversion in recent centuries as its wetland habitat is generally located in optimal agricultural soils and landscapes, processes that continue to some extent into the present. Being often located at the lower edges of intensively farmed lands, sedimentation and agrochemical run-off into wetland habitat is an issue. </p>  <p>The Bog Turtle's range is localized, both at the geographic scale (scattered areas of occurrence with extensive areas where the species is absent from suitable habitat) and at the local landscape scale, where suitable habitat is localized in a mosaic of other habitat types. Fragmentation of habitat has continued with agricultural intensification and optimization, and infrastructure, residential and industrial development. </p>  <p>Within protected wetland habitat areas, vegetation succession by both native plants and invasives can reduce the suitability of wetlands to bog turtles. </p>  <p>While fully protected throughout its range, the Bog Turtle remains in small but high demand in the pet trade by virtue of its small size, attractive colouration and reputed rarity. Because of the small home range size and sensitivity of its wetland habitat, disturbance and habitat trampling are greater concerns for this species than most other turtles.</p>  <p>Road mortality and increased predation of eggs and hatchlings from subsidized raccoons has been indicated. The impact of global warming, under various predicted scenarios, on hydrology and habitat supporting the Bog Turtle has not yet been evaluated in detail but warrants concern.<br/></p>  <p>Reports of die-offs, presumed related to disease, emerged in 2009; the extent and severity of epidemic disease has not been documented range-wide, but Brenner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>.

At an estimated population replacement time of 25 years, three generations stretch from the end of the Wild West era up to the suburban sprawl era.

It may enter woodlands, particularly along streams. Subspecies <em>luteola</em> in Arizona and New Mexico may also be found on the desert fringe (Ernst <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994). In nature, <em>Terrapene ornata</em> feed mainly on insects (mainly beetles, caterpillars and grasshoppers);berries, carrion and other items are also eaten (Legler 1960, Ernst <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1994).</p><p>Both sexes of Ornate Box turtles may reach 15.4 cm carapace length (CL). Most males mature at about 10-11 cm plastron length (PL), and females at PL of about 11-13 cm, at ages of eight to nine and 10-11, respectively (Legler 1960). Average clutch size is 4.7 eggs in Kansas (Legler 1960) and 3.5 in Wisconsin (Doroff and Keith 1990); extremes of clutch size are two to eight. Depending on location and probably on environmental conditions, some females may produce a second clutch in a year, while many females skip reproduction for one or two years (Legler 1960, Doroff and Keith 1990). Hatchlings measure about 30 mm (range 28-32 mm). The oldest animal in a studied Kansas population was estimated to be 28 years old, and the population was estimated to have almost complete turnover in 25 years (Metcalf and Metcalf 1985).

Long-term attrition from incidental mortality was calculated to cause a continuing decline. Habitat loss as prairies were converted to croplands, and buffalo disappeared and with them the supply of droppings and dung beetles, must have affected Ornate Box Turtle populations historically. Substantial numbers of animals have been collected in the past for the domestic and international pet trade, with potentially significant population impacts.","Populations of Ornate Box Turtles can be numerous, reaching densities of 6.4-15.6 animals per hectare of favourable habitat in Kansas (Legler 1960).

97672550,6232,Dama mesopotamica,Endangered,D,2015,2015-07-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a result of intensive hunting throughout prehistory and history this species, which was once abundant and widespread in the Near and Middle East, became comparatively rare throughout its range. Within the last 100 years it has twice been brought to the brink of extinction. The total wild population now contains more than 250 adults (including wild living re-introduced individuals) but it is questioned whether the re-introduced individuals in the second biggest population (Judean Hills, Israel) have produced viable offspring (i.e. they cannot definitively be considered ""mature individuals""). It is not known whether there are any individuals remaining in the indigenous wild populations in Iran (Dez and Karkeh Wildlife Refuges). According to a precautionary approach the species qualifies for the Endangered category under criterion D. This species should be reassessed when further information becomes available on population size and the exact number of mature individuals.","The Persian Fallow Deer occupies a range of woodlands, such as tamarisk, oak and pistachio woodlands. The wild population utilizes riparian forest thickets (Haltenorth 1959, McTaggart-Cowan and Holloway 1978). The rut is during August and early September, and calving at the end of March to early April, following a gestation period of approximately 229 days (Chapman and Chapman 1975).","This species has experienced numerous threats such as intensive hunting pressure, habitat destruction, natural predation and competition with livestock, and this led to its long decline and near extinction. Today in Iran, habitat destruction, competition with livestock, lack of freshwater and increasing levels of tick infestation are considered significant threats to the species, as well as the effects of small population size, such as isolation and inbreeding (Hemami and Rabiei 2002, A Rabiei pers. comm. 2014). In Israel, while there is no evidence of deleterious inbreeding effects, the population is susceptible as genetic diversity is extremely low. Predation by wild and feral canids also has a considerable impact on newly released animals making reintroduction difficult.","The Persian Fallow Deer was thought to be extinct by the 1940s, but a small population of perhaps 25 animals was subsequently rediscovered in Khuzistan Province, Iran during the 1950s (Haltenorth 1959, Chapman and Chapman 1975). As of the mid 1990s, the total population in Iran (including captive and re-introduced animals) did not exceed 250. By 2004, the total Iranian population had increased to approximately 340 individuals (A. Rabiei pers. comm.). <br/><br/>In 2013 the Iranian populations totalled 371 individuals across 14 sites, Ashk Island is the largest population with 213 animals in semi-captive conditions. The 13 other considerably smaller populations are in fenced areas in other sites around the country. It is not known whether any truly wild individuals remain in the Dez and Kharkeh Wildlife Refuges (A. Rabiei pers. comm. 2014).&#160; Following reintroduction in Israel (Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011) there are now over 250 individuals in the north of the country around the Kziv Reserve (western Galilee) and this population is increasing (D. Saltz pers. comm. 2014). There are also approximately 50 individuals (circa 20 radio-collared females and a similar number of males; N. Werner pers. comm. 2014) in and around the Soreq Nature Reserve, Judean Hills, in central Israel. In 2014, two new reintroduction projects were initiated near Sasa (Berger-Tal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011), about 50 km east of the Kziv Reserve, and on the Hermon Mountain ridge, north of the Golan Heights. Although the total wild population now contains more than 250 adults (including wild living re-introduced individuals), it is questioned whether the re-introduced individuals in the second biggest population (Judean Hills, Israel) have produced viable offspring (i.e. they cannot definitively be considered ""mature individuals"").<br/><br/>There are approximately 270 individuals in captivity in Hai Bar Carmel Reserve, Biblical Zoo of Jerusalem and other facilities (A. Dolev pers. comm., T. Dickstein pers. comm., ZIMS). Outside of Iran and Israel there are approximately 160 individuals in various zoos, mainly in Europe (ZIMS).",Increasing,"Archaeological and historical data attest that Persian Fallow Deer was distributed from the western Iranian plateau to the Mediterranean and from Southern Anatolia to South Levant, which nowadays includes western Iran, Iraq, Israel, eastern Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and southeastern Turkey (e.g. Haltenorth 1959, Chapman and Chapman 1975, Uerpmann 1987, Hemami and Rabiei 2002, Daujat 2013, Vigne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015, Daujat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). It was thought that the geographic distribution of the two species of Fallow Deer – European and Persian – did not overlap. However, recent research suggests that the two might have co-existed and even hybridised in some areas of southeastern Turkey (Sykes and Baker pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The Persian Fallow Deer played a major role as game in the economic subsistence of numerous Late Glacial and Early Holocene human societies of the Near and Middle East, especially in Southern Levant during the Late Pleistocene (Davis 1982, Bar-Oz <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). However, it was during the Holocene period – from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic to the Bronze Age (over six millennia), that it became of cultural significance on the island of Cyprus, after being purposely introduced by humans at the very end of the 9th millennium BC. This intentional translocation did not result a priori in domestication of Persian Fallow Deer on Cyprus at any time (Croft 1991, 2002, Davis 1994, Daujat 2013, Vigne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015, Daujat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). Although populations probably experienced depletion throughout the early Neolithic periods – PPNB and Aceramic – because of intense human hunting pressure and destruction of habitats/competition with domesticates, at least a partial human desertion of the island seems to have replenished the stock of Persian Fallow Deer (Croft 2002, Daujat 2013, Vigne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2015, Daujat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). Despite an underlying concern towards more sustainable management until the Bronze Age, the growth of human density and destruction of its natural habitat, and hunting/poaching pressure, eventually brought the Persian Fallow Deer on Cyprus to its total extinction on the island sometime during the Late Medieval/early post-Medieval period (Croft 2002, Flourentzos 2002, Daujat 2013, Daujat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). On the continental mainland in Southern Levant, Persian Fallow Deer is known to have drastically decreased in importance in humans’ subsistence from the Natufian period until the Crusader periods in conjunction with its population in the wild for the very same reasons (Tsahar <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>The Persian Fallow Deer is also reported outside its natural range in Egypt at least from 2nd millennium BC, probably as a menagerie animal (Kitagawa 2008). Persian Fallow Deer has been depicted in a wide variety of forms throughout its geographic range: from Bronze Age pottery on Cyprus to Assyrian relief artwork, Egyptian paintings and Mesopotamian cylinder-seal (e.g. Haltenorth 1959, Chapman and Chapman 1975, Uerpmann 1987, Flourentzos 2002, Kitagawa 2008). <br/><br/>By 1875 it was restricted to southwestern and western Iran, having disappeared from the rest of its range. In the early 1950s it was considered extinct, but a small population was rediscovered in southwestern Iran in 1956 and brought to Germany in order to start a breeding programme at the Opel Zoo, in Kronberg (Haltenorth 1959). The last documented surviving indigenous wild populations were found in the Dez Wildlife Refuge and Karkeh Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Iran (though the population in Karkeh has also been restocked with animals from the Dasht-e-Naz Wildlife Refuge), but it is unclear whether any true wild animals still remain in these areas today (A Rabiei. pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>There are reintroduced populations in Iran as follows: Dasht-e-Naz Wildlife Refuge in northern Iran, Semeskandeh Wildlife Refuge in northern Iran, Ashk and Kaboudan Islands in Lake Uromiyeh (Uromiyeh National Park), and the Miankotal enclosure in Arjan and Parishan Protected Area. All these reintroduced populations are either in enclosures or on islands in semi-captive conditions (A. Rabiei pers. comm. 2014).. Introductions to Shiri, Lavan, Kish Islands in the Persian Gulf were probably not successful.<br/><br/>In Israel, a reintroduction programme for Persian Fallow Deer has been underway since 1996 with more than 300 animals in the wild today, mainly in the north of the country (Galilee) but also in the Judean Mountains near Jerusalem. The breeding nucleus in Israel, at Hai-Bar Carmel Reserve, was founded in 1976 from three animals (two males and one female) from the Opel Zoo and four females from the Iranian population at the Dasht-e-Naz (Chapman 2010) facility in Iran. Some of the animals at the nearby Semeskandeh facility were received from Opel Zoo in 1973 and were suspected to be hybrids with European Fallow Deer. Until recently it was suspected that some of the deer transported to Israel were from Semeskandeh. However, all hybrids produced at Opel Zoo were reported to have been disposed of in 1965-66 (Jantschke 1991). Early genetics studies (using enzymes) show no evidence of hybridization in the descendants of the Opel Zoo animals transferred to Semeshkandeh (Pemberton 1990, Saltz 2013). A recent genetic study using seven microsatellite markers in Persian Fallow Deer from the modern Israeli herd and the Iranian population from the 1960s detected no evidence of hybridization (Fernández-García 2012). For the Iranian animals however, the possibility that hybridization has since occurred cannot be excluded.",This species is still hunted illegally for food and sport.,Terrestrial,"This species has an important and interesting conservation history (see Daujat 2013 for a complete review). In 1960, the Iranian Game and Fish Department initiated the first conservation actions by designating the Dez Wildlife Refuge and Karkeh Wildlife Refuge around the site of this animal's re-discovery. A male and a female calf were bought from local people in southwest Iran by a team from Von Opel’s Zoo in Germany in 1957–1958. In 1960 the first fawn was conceived in Opel (a female) but the male died before conceiving a male. Subsequently a stag was sent to Germany in 1964. In the interim the female was cross bred with European males (Hemami and Rabiei 2002). The hybrids were disposed of in 1965-1966 (Jantschke 1991). Between 1964 and 1965, a 400 strong team captured six deer within the protected areas and transferred them to the Dasht-e-Naz Wildlife Refuge, where they were managed in a 55 hectare enclosure, and where the population increased. Iran received seven animals from Germany in 1972 which were suspected hybrids, and kept them isolated from the pure-bred Persian population at Dasht-e-Naz. This population totalled 30 animals in 1977 and was transferred to a six hectare enclosure in Semeskandeh Wildlife Refuge to allow more space for the pure-bred population, and to prevent gene exchange between them. From 1977, specimens of pure-bred Persian fallow deer were transferred to new sites in different parts of Iran including its original habitat in Karkheh Wildlife Refuge. Signs of deer were still presented in Karkheh prior to the translocation (Hemami and Rabiei 2002). Subsequently in 1995 the new enclosure (180 ha) was established in Semeskandeh Wildlife Refuge for transferred pure-bred deer from Dasht-e-Naz, in order to reduce the population density in Dasht-e-Naz (Rabiei 2002). <br/><br/>The four females transported to Israel came from this enclosure and in combination with two males and a female from the Opel Zoo formed the breeding nucleus that supports the Israeli reintroduction programme. There are currently four reintroduction sites: three in the north (in and around the Kziv Reserve, near Sasa, and in the Golan Heights) and one in the Judean Mountains (near Jerusalem). The Kziv population is increasing through on-going releases and reproduction of released animals, it is now estimated at 250 animals. The Judean Mountains population is estimated at 50 individuals and is expanding slowly. These conservation measures have brought the species back from the brink of extinction, and the population is gradually increasing. However, the two truly wild populations in Iran remain seriously threatened and need strict protection in order to recover, although extinction in the wild cannot be ruled out. <br/><br/>Recommended conservation actions within Iran have been compiled by Rabiei (1995, 2002, 2003), and include: further population surveys, ecological and genetic research, strengthening of existing management of protected areas, creation of new protected areas, promote protection of the last remaining truly wild populations in the Dez Wildlife Refuge and Karkeh Wildlife Refuge, re-introducing animals to these two populations, strengthening the existing captive breeding programs, and establishing a collaborative captive breeding programme and reintroductions across the historic range of the species. In Israel, future plans include the continuation of the captive breeding and reintroductions, to create a continuous population in the north of the country. Control of overabundant predators will be necessary to ensure the continued success of the reintroductions.<br/><br/>A thorough knowledge and understanding of the genetic aspects of Persian Fallow Deer is important for its management. Further work is therefore required to detect the genetic integrity of the contemporary Persian Fallow Deer using an increased number of samples and polymorphic markers, since it is advised that at least 30 markers should be used to accurately detect evidence of hybridization (Boecklen and Howard 1997). This will help guide a specific conservation policy that is currently lacking and as such puts the last wild stocks of Persian Fallow Deer at risk of extinction.<br/><br/>The species is included on CITES Appendix I (as <em>Dama dama mesopotamica</em>). An <em>International Studbook of Persian Fallow Deer</em> has been issued every year since 1991, registering all of the animals in zoological parks and providing estimates of wild population numbers (Rudloff 1991-2015).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
101293528,2892,Bos mutus,Vulnerable,C1,2016,2014-07-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion C1. It is estimated that the population of mature individuals is less than 10,000, and it is estimated that there will be a continuing decline of at least 10% in 30 years (generation length estimated at 10 years) from poaching&#160;and continued threats to its habitat, particularly in the eastern portion of its remaining range. In most areas there is also a danger of Wild Yak hybridizing with domestic yak (<em>Bos grunniens</em>). This is a particular concern because there is a long history of domestic cattle (<em>Bos taurus</em>) admixture with domestic Yak populations (Qi <em>et al.</em> 2009). Similar reductions are projected into the future.<br/></p>","Wild Yaks live in the alpine tundra, grasslands, and cold desert regions of the northern Tibetan plateau (Wiener <em>et al</em>. 2003). These mountainous areas range from 4,000 to 6,100 m elevation. In the Chang Tang Reserve in northwestern Tibet, the average annual precipitation is only 100–300 mm, much of it falling as hail and snow; lakes are generally saline and surface water is scarce. Temperatures can fall below -40°C. Vegetation is sparse, and is dominated by grasses, sedges, forbs, and low or procumbent shrubs; much of it can be classed as alpine, or high cold steppe (Schaller and Gu 1994). The species moves seasonally, descending into lower valleys in the winter (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1994, Smith and Xie 2008). It feeds mostly on grasses and sedges, with some forbs. Yaks are gregarious, often aggregating into groups of &#160;&gt;100 individuals, although smaller groups of 10-20 are also common. Adult males often travel with females and young, although older males will often travel alone or form small groups of 2-5. Male herds range mostly at lower altitudes and in less rugged topography than females (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2014).","Poaching, including commercial poaching for meat, has been seen as the most serious threat to Wild Yaks (Schaller and Gu 1994, Miller and Schaller 1997, Harris <em>et al</em>. 1999). Males tend to be more vulnerable to hunting, especially by motorized hunters, because they tend to disperse away from the hill bases and high ridges apparently preferred by females (Schaller and Gu 1994, Berger <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, with the confiscation of weapons in most of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, poaching has declined as a threat to Yak populations. However, Wild Yaks have limited tolerance for disturbance from people and their livestock; they tend to move away from areas where livestock are herded. Increasing livestock herds and increased intensity of pasture use displaces Wild Yaks and ultimately reduces availability of Wild Yak habitat (Harris 2007).<br/><br/>Interbreeding between domestic and Wild Yaks also presents a threat to the remaining Wild Yak populations (NRC 1983, Khan 1984, Schaller and Liu 1996, Harris <em>et al</em>. 1999, Smith and Xie 2008, Rawat and Sankar 2011). Diseases transmitted from domestic livestock, either directly or via other Wild species, may be an additional threat, although this has not yet been documented. Schaller and Gu (1994) documented low recruitment in a Wild Yak population in the Chang Tang Reserve in 1990. Only 6.7% of the total population sample (n=586) in the Aru basin of Chang Tang Reserve were young of that year; in the nearby Yalung basin the figure was only 5.3% (n=114). Even fewer young were recorded in 1992: only 1.0% of the population (n=315) comprised young animals and only one yearling was seen (n=225) in the Aru basin. It is unknown whether this reproductive failure was due to disease - e.g., brucellosis, which can cause spontaneous abortion - or to high levels of postpartum mortality (Schaller and Gu 1994).<br/><br/>Where Wild Yaks have held on or increased in numbers, interactions and conflicts with domestic pastoralists have recently increased (including abducting domestic Yaks into wild herds, and in some cases, damage to humans or their property; Tsering <em>et al</em>. 2006). This has the potential to increase retaliatory killing (although it presently appears to be rare).&#160;In some villages of Sanjiangyuan reserve, Qinghai, however, Wild Yaks are protected for the hybridization benefits of Wild Yak bulls breeding with domestic Yak cows even though domestic cows are occasionally lost to wild herds and a domestic bull was killed (Buzzard 2011).&#160; Future research into management techniques will hopefully reduce or eliminate the loss of domestic Yak to wild herds, and buffer zones without domestic Yak are being investigated in the Chang Tang Reserve.<p></p>","Schaller and Liu (1996) estimated 8,000–8,500 Wild Yaks in Tibet, of which about 7,000–7,500 were in the Chang Tang Reserve (284,000 km²), plus about 3,200–3,700 in Qinghai Province, and about 2,000–2,500 in Xinjiang. These figures were, of necessity, a combination of estimates and inferences, but they suggest that the world population of Wild Yak was probably about 15,000 in 1995 (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1994, Schaller 1998). However, the population trend has been downward in many areas: Wild Yak in the southern 24% of Chang Tang have been almost exterminated with the arrival of herders since the 1960s. In the last IUCN Red List assessment, Harris and Leslie (2008) estimated the population for Wild Yak at no more than 10,000 mature individuals, and this is still likely.<br/><br/>Recent protection from poaching has allowed populations to remain stable or increase in some areas but available habitat for expansion is limited because of competition with domestic livestock (Harris 2007). The Arjin Shan Reserve in Xinjiang had a substantial sub-population in the late-1980s, but the subpopulation declined precipitously in the early 1990s (Achuff and Petocz 1988, Schaller and Liu 1996). Buzzard <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted that the subpopulation seems to be stable or increasing. They recorded a minimum of 1,700 Yaks in the northeast of Arjin Shan and estimate that at least 2,000-2,500 Wild Yak remain in Arjin Shan. In addition, at least one area in Qinghai, locally termed “Wild Yak Valley”, has retained a high abundance of Wild Yaks (approximately 1,700 counted in 2002), with no evidence of decline (and possibly an increase) from the early 1990s through at least 2007 (Harris <em>et al</em>. 1999, Harris and Loggers 2004, Harris 2007, Harris unpub. data 2007). Schaller <em>et al</em>. (2007) tallied 977 Wild Yaks in November 2006 through the northern Chang Tang and Kekexili Nature Reserves into the western-most part of the Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve. Schaller <em>et al</em>. (2007) observed the majority of Yaks (713) in Kekexili, and this is an increase from the 502 Yaks observed along the same route in November 2004 (Buzzard 2004 referenced in Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2007). Schaller (2012) also noted an increase over time in the number of Wild Yaks seen in the eastern Chang Tang.<br/><br/>In India, a maximum of around 110 Wild Yak remain, with some individuals moving seasonally into the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir from areas controlled by China (Schaller and Liu 1996, Ul-Haq 2003, Rawat and Sankar 2011). This population has likely increased from the very few Yak previously reported (Schaller and Liu 1996, Ul-Haq 2003), but threats remain from competition with domestic livestock and interbreeding with domestic Yak (Rawat and Sankar 2011).",Decreasing,"Historically, this species occurred throughout the Tibetan Plateau, including China (Gansu, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai), northern India (Ladak), and Nepal (Schaller and Liu 1996). According to Smith and Xie (2008), the species apparently occurred in Kazakhstan, Mongolia and southern Russia until the 13th-18th centuries, although these countries are not included on the IUCN Red List country list or range map, given the uncertainty surrounding the dates of extinction, and whether they occurred in these places after the year 1500, the cut-off date for recording extinctions on the IUCN Red List.<br/><br/>The species is considered extinct in both Nepal and Bhutan. Until recent decades Wild Yak penetrated northern Nepal (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1994). Recent reports of Wild Yak in northwest Nepal&#160;(R. Acharya pers. comm.)&#160;&#160;need to be confirmed. In India, the species is currently known from Ladakh region of Jammu &amp; Kashmir (Rawat and Sankar 2011).<br/><br/>In China, the species occurs in scattered populations on the Tibetan Plateau (Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Tibet), with the main populations remaining in the Chang Tang Reserve, covering 284,000 km² between in northern Tibet (Schaller and Liu 199, Fox <em>et al</em>. 2004), as well as in the Arjin Shan area of southeastern Xinjiang, and  Kekexili Nature Reserve in Qinghai and adjacent areas of the Kunlun Mountains (Harris <em>et al</em>. 1999, Harris and Loggers 2004, Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2007).

Not only is there is a massive demand for bushmeat stemming from the cities, but rebel factions and poorly-paid government soldiers add to that demand, at the same time facilitating the flow of guns and ammunition (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). In some areas, local taboos against eating Bonobo meat still exist, but in others, these traditions are disintegrating due to changing cultural values and population movements. Stricter enforcement of wildlife laws and more effective management are urgently needed.<br/><br/>Habitat loss through deforestation and fragmentation ranks second. Much of the forest loss in this region is caused by slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture, which is most intense where human densities are high or growing. Logging and mining do not yet occur on an industrial scale in the Bonobo’s range, but in future, industrial agriculture is very likely to become a serious threat. Minimising the conversion of intact forest to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the future survival of Bonobos. Countrywide factors contributing to the decline include the mobility of growing human populations, opening markets, commercial exploitation of natural resources and road construction. As in the past, the survival of Bonobos will be determined by the levels of poaching and forest loss—threats that have been shown to accompany rapid growth in human populations and political instability (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2014). Due to their slow life history and a generation time estimated to be 25 years, Bonobo populations cannot withstand high levels of offtake. The population decline over a three-generation (75 year) period from 2003 to 2078 is likely to exceed 50%, hence qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A.<br/><p></p>","The geographic range of <em>Pan paniscus</em> is characterised by undulating terrain with elevations between 300 and 700 m asl and a humid climate (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bonobos inhabit closed, moist, mixed, mature and secondary forests as well as forest-savannah mosaics (<em>ibid</em>.). In the eastern and southern parts of their range, Bonobos occupy a mosaic of moist tropical forest, dry forest, savannah woodland, marshy grassland and swamp forest, yet they also require access to relatively-undisturbed mature forests. If available, Bonobos prefer primary forests and seasonally-inundated swamp forests, foraging in small streams and breast-deep ponds (Narat 2014, Serckx 2014).<br/><br/>Bonobos are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. They live in multimale-multifemale, fission-fusion communities, usually made up of 30–80 individuals. A single community occupies a home range of 20–60 km², and there is extensive overlap between the ranges of different communities (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bonobos are omnivorous; over 50% of their diet is comprised of fruits and seeds, which are supplemented with leaves, stems, shoots, pith, bark, flowers, truffles, fungus, and honey (Hohmann <em>et al</em>. 2006). They appear to be more dependent on terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, including aquatic plants, than chimpanzees. Bonobos have occasionally been documented hunting and eating vertebrates (e.g., duikers, primates; Hohmann and Fruth 2008) and invertebrates (e.g., termites, caterpillars; Kano 1992). Bonobos build new nests to sleep in each night and sometimes make day nests in trees at heights of 5–50 m (Fruth 1995). It has been reported that Bonobos also make ground nests (Kano 1983, Guislain and Reinartz pers. comm). Their role as seed dispersers is critical for forest regeneration (Tsuji <em>et al</em>. 2010, Beaune <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>There is no birth season. Gestation is about eight months. Interbirth interval at Wamba (1976–1996) averages 4.8 years, and females average 0.18 offspring per year of their adult life. Physical maturation is slow with infants being weaned shortly before birth of the next offspring. Infant and juvenile mortality is low, with 73% of offspring surviving to age six (Furuichi <em>et al</em>. 1998). Females migrate aged 6–13 years, settling into a new community when they start cycling at 9–12 years. They produce their first offspring at 13–14 years of age (Furuichi <em>et al</em>. 2012). One generation is estimated to be 23–25 years (Myers Thompson 1997, T. Furuichi pers. comm. 2007, Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><p></p>","<p>The major threats to Bonobos include: poaching (mainly for bushmeat and for some medicinal purposes); residue from civil warfare (availability of modern weaponry and ammunition; military-sanctioned hunting); human-induced habitat alteration (commercial logging and agriculture, traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, fallow land); human population growth and migration; and lack of education (insufficient awareness among urban and rural communities that hunting and eating Bonobos is unlawful). Bonobos reproduce slowly, and thus their populations are particularly susceptible to direct losses caused by humans.&#160;</p><p></p><ol><li><strong>Poaching</strong>: despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, poaching is the most direct and immediate threat to great apes in DRC. Although taboos against hunting Bonobos still exist in some regions, these taboos have become ineffective where poachers are not local. In other locations, transient and immigrant human populations with different cultural values have increased the frequency of hunting and eating of Bonobos. Poachers prefer large mammals, and since&#160;Bonobos are the largest primate in the region, they may be targeted along with ungulates and monkeys. Commercial poachers, aided by military and local administrations, are active even in legally-protected sites, such as Salonga National Park (SNP), Lomako-Yokokala Faunal Reserve, Tumba-Lediima Natural Reserve, Sankuru Natural Reserve, and the proposed Lomami National Park. The importance of these protected areas as significant reservoirs of Bonobos will be compromised rapidly if current levels of poaching continue. Between 2003 and 2006, Hart <em>et al</em>. (2008) recorded evidence of poaching in 51% of survey grids across SNP, with hunting pressure highest in the north and east. However, since then, investment in effective antipoaching measures appears to have protected at least the Lokofa Sector in the southern block of SNP, where Bonobo abundance remained stable between 2006 and 2015 (WCS 2015). Extrapolating from interview data gathered for a bushmeat survey conducted in the Lomami National Park (LNP) area in 2008, it was estimated that 270 Bonobos per year were consumed around Kindu, representing three Bonobos per 100 km² per year in the area investigated (Mirambo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Currently, this negative trend has been halted within the park through surveillance and collaboration with local communities (Hart and Hart 2011, 2015). The intake rate of orphaned Bonobos into the Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary may be viewed as another indicator of hunting pressure and/or anti-trafficking efforts. Hughes <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that 4.2 Chimpanzees (2.6–8.9 individuals) are removed from the wild whenever a single live infant is obtained as a by-product of a hunt. Considering that Bonobos are more social than Chimpanzees, the ratio of dead&#160;Bonobos per orphaned infant may be higher. Data compiled between 1994 and 2012 show a small but steady increase in the number of orphans entering the sanctuary, with two peaks each of six infants in 1997 and 2000 during the Congolese wars, and a peak of 16 individuals in 2004 after the implementation of peace and return to the regular use of rivers as major transport routes (ABC 2012). An influx of nine Bonobos in 2012 was also notably high, but arrivals decreased to two in 2015. While various explanations for lower intakes are possible (e.g., decline of Bonobos in the wild, or effective anti-poaching and anti-trafficking measures, or Bonobos being exported illegally), it is important to remember that the variation in such small numbers may be stochastic, rather than a real trend.</li><li><strong>Habitat loss</strong>: subsistence agriculture, commercial agriculture, logging and road construction all cause forest loss and fragmentation that reduces the usable (or ‘effective’) habitat available to&#160;Bonobos. Moreover, civil strife has been shown to exacerbate destruction and degradation of&#160;Bonobo&#160;habitat: in Luo Scientific Reserve and Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve, primary forest loss in previously unfragmented core forests was over two times greater during a decade when conflict and war were predominant in the region (1990–2000) than during a relatively conflict-free period (2000–2010), when humans left their hiding in core forest areas and returned to their natal villages and farms within long-established agricultural complexes (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, as conflict recedes, large-scale commerce is expanding and industrial agriculture is likely to become a significant driver of forest loss. Oil palm is already being grown in what would otherwise be&#160;Bonobo&#160;habitat (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2012), and Africa is becoming the new frontier for oil-palm plantations, which offers excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperature conditions (Rival and Levang 2014). A staggering 99.2% of the Bonobo’s range is suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014), highlighting the enormous risk the palm-oil industry will pose unless sustainable management plans are developed and implemented to protect great apes and their habitats (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014). It is worth noting that even though permits for prospection or resource extraction have already been granted, drilling for petroleum is unlikely to recommence in the near future, given the low price of crude oil on the international market. Although logging and mining do not yet occur on a large scale in Bonobo habitat, industrial extraction could become a serious threat in future. Minimising the conversion of intact forest in DRC to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the survival of Bonobos, particularly when considering DRC’s high human population growth rate (2.45% in 2015; CIA 2015).</li><li><strong>Disease</strong>: infectious diseases are of particular concern in areas where Bonobos live in close proximity to human communities, or have been habituated to human observers for research or tourism purposes (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015). Diseases that pose a risk to Bonobos include human-borne pathogens such as respiratory viruses, and natural pathogens such as <em>Ebolavirus</em>. Respiratory disease outbreaks were observed among Bonobos at Wamba when displaced people and soldiers were moving through the forest (Sakamaki<em> et al</em>. 2009), and human respiratory syncytial virus and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> co-infection has been detected at Malebo, where Bonobo habitat is surrounded by a particularly high human density (Leendertz pers. comm.). In 2014, a human outbreak of Ebola virus disease occurred in the Bonobo’s range. Considering their highly cohesive social structure, and high rates of physical contact, an <em>Ebolavirus</em> outbreak could devastate a Bonobo community. Despite a lack of scientific investigation of disease in wild Bonobos, these cases highlight the increasing need for health monitoring and disease contingency plans, as recommended by Gilardi <em>et al</em>. (2015).</li></ol><p></p><p></p>","The size of the Bonobo population is uncertain because only 30% of its historic range has been surveyed. Estimates from the four known Bonobo strongholds, based around protected areas, suggest a minimum population of 15,000–20,000 individuals (IUCN and ICCN 2012, IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). Although Hickey <em>et al</em>. (2013) compiled and analysed all Bonobo survey data collected between 2003 and 2010, the survey coverage was too patchy to allow the total number of Bonobos to be estimated.<br/><br/>Sop <em>et al</em>. (in prep.) used spatial modelling to investigate trends in Bonobo nest encounter rates on recce and standard line transect surveys carried out in two different periods. Data were available from eight sites, covering a total area of 16,500 km². Site-specific change estimates were weighted according to population size, and then change in nest encounter rates between different years was used as a proxy for Bonobo population change. Rate of change was estimated using two approaches: site-level Generalized Linear Models (GLMs); and a simple exponential population change model (ExpM). Sop <em>et al</em>. estimated an annual decline of 5.95% with a total decline of 54.9% between 2003 and 2015 (95% confidence interval: -17.6% to +6.4% and -18% to +0.001% for the GLM and ExpM, respectively). Under the same conditions, the expected decline in abundance over one, two and three generations (25, 50 and 75 years respectively) would be 85.6%, 97.9% and 99.7%, respectively. However, not all sites experienced significant declines in Bonobo abundance. The Lokofa Sector of Salonga National Park, for example, has ecoguards deployed throughout and was the best protected of the eight sites in the analysis (WCS 2015). Although Sop <em>et al</em>.’s assessment incorporated data from both protected and non-protected areas, the total coverage was limited by data availability. In addition, the preliminary model had limitations with regard to the representativeness of sites and data availability, such as disproportionate sampling effort between years; and lack of data on seasonality, nest production, re-use and decay rates. If few nests are located and sample size is low, then precision tends to be poor, leading to weak detection of trends. Although a drop in abundance between the two time periods was detected, the small number of paired samples did not produce population sizes. The range-wide data required will eventually show areas considered to be suitable, but from which Bonobos are absent, and perhaps presence of Bonobos in areas not yet surveyed. Despite uncertainty around the modelled rate of decline, a strong negative trend is apparent in Sop <em>et al</em>.’s analysis. Even with an annual rate of decline of only 1%, total losses would exceed 50% over three generations, underscoring the need for monitoring of Bonobo populations and threats.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pan paniscus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> has a discontinuous range in the low-lying central basin of Equatorial Africa, south of the Congo River.

Bonobos are protected by national and international laws throughout their range, and the majority are found in national parks (IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). However, most protected areas lack resources and suffer from poorly-controlled poaching, and enforcement is generally weak.</p><p>An IUCN and ICCN (2012) Bonobo conservation strategy (<a href=""http://www.primate-sg.org/bonobo"">http://www.primate-sg.org/bonobo</a>)&#160;outlines five intervention strategies with objectives and conservation actions centred on the Bonobo&#160;‘strongholds’,&#160;which are to be implemented by 2022:</p><p></p><ol><li><strong>Strengthening institutional capacity.&#160;</strong>One objective under this strategy is the creation of new protected areas. Since SNP was established in 1970, an additional 35,580 km² supporting Bonobos has been officially designated. The Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve in the ‘northern block’ was created in 2012 (Sakamaki <em>et al.</em> 2012). The establishment of LNP, currently a provincial park with a ban on all hunting, will add 8,880 km² of protected habitat to the Bonobo’s range (Doumenge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Once LNP is officially gazetted, protected areas harbouring Bonobo populations will total more than 78,080 km². Protected areas, however, will not curtail poaching as long as law enforcement is ineffective, thus the objectives of eliminating poaching, monitoring and controlling the bushmeat trade, and eliminating the circulation of weapons and ammunition in protected areas are crucial. Considerable efforts have been made in SNP, with recent improvements in guard numbers, education and equipment. The government’s ‘Operation Bonobo’ aims to confiscate military weapons that have been in circulation since 2012, carry out joint FARDC and ICCN patrols, and liberate the parts of SNP under the control of poachers. A specially-trained ‘<em>Corps en charge de la sécurisation des Parcs Nationaux</em>’ will be in charge of anti-poaching in all national parks. However, law enforcement in the Bonobo’s range as a whole is still fragmentary, and conservation efforts are hampered by the vastness of the areas to be patrolled, as well as corruption and isolation, and persistent political and economic instability. NGOs and research projects with bilateral investment provide greater assurance of active and permanent on-the-ground enforcement, and are working to strengthen ICCN’s limited capacity throughout DRC.</li><li><strong>Consultation and collaboration with local actors.&#160;</strong>Here the main objective is to integrate conservation issues into national development plans, land-use and macro-zoning plans, and implement sustainable subsistence activities at key sites. In an attempt to transfer responsibility for&#160;managing natural&#160;resources to local communities, WWF began sensibilisation activities in the Lac Tumba and Salonga-Lukenie-Sankuru landscapes and around southern block of SNP, and assisted stakeholders to establish local development and conservation committees (<em>Comités locaux de développement et de conservation</em>).&#160;</li><li><strong>Awareness building and lobbying.&#160;</strong>Objectives include developing a nationwide communications strategy, undertaking awareness-building activities at key sites, sensitising urban communities and private sector operators, and lobbying government administration at national and provincial levels. In 1995, USAID established the 25-year Central Africa Regional Programme for the Environment (CARPE) to increase local, national and regional capacity and participation in natural resource management, and strengthen conservation policy development and implementation to reduce biodiversity loss. Recently, CARPE established two distinct but interdependent projects:&#160;an Environmental Monitoring and Policy Support (EMAPS) project intended to boost the quality and scope of conservation policy-making, and forest monitoring, analysis and information dissemination; and CAFEC (see below; USAID 2014). Smaller organisations are conducting conservation education programmes in areas adjacent to Bonobo habitat as well as urban centres, such as Kinshasa or Kisangani, where demand for bushmeat is high. For example, Lola ya Bonobo in Kinshasa welcomes more than 20,000 visitors per annum, half of them school children. Such education-outreach activities can influence local attitudes to wildlife (ABC 2014).</li><li><strong>Research and monitoring activities.&#160;</strong>The primary objective here is to develop a clear framework for monitoring Bonobo populations and the threats to Bonobos, which is necessary to track changes in population size and distribution, to assess the level and location of threats, and ultimately to assess progress towards the Goal and Vision of the 2012 conservation strategy. The Central Africa Forest Ecosystems Conservation (CAFEC) project, and the SCAEMPS programme (Strengthening Central Africa Environmental Management and Policy Support) were established under CARPE. CAFEC supports the sustainable management of targeted forest landscapes, which include most of the landscapes where Bonobos occur, and involves targeted, site-based activities. SCAEMPS is a regional ‘quality control’ programme, ensuring that standardised, state of the art methods of monitoring wildlife, law enforcement (such as SMART&#160;<a href=""http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org/"">http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org</a>), and livelihoods and governance are used across CARPE landscapes, and that databases are established to store the data collected. Supported by CARPE and other donors, ICCN and international NGOs have implemented surveys in about 40% of SNP. A three-year co-management agreement for the future monitoring and management of SNP was signed in 2015, focusing on the education, training and support of guards. Development of cost-efficient methods for biomonitoring (camera traps, drones) is underway. Development of a disease prevention plan to minimise human-Bonobo disease transmission, and establish an early detection mechanism and an emergency intervention plan to address potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks is not yet underway.</li><li><strong>Sustainable funding.&#160;</strong>Here, the objective is to evaluate funding needs for Bonobo conservation and create sustainable sources of funding. In the last 10 years,&#160;government donors (EU, KfW, USAID) have provided considerable conservation finance to support biodiversity conservation, park management, education or other developmental aid, rather than species-specific activities.&#160;While Bonobos will benefit from general support, a number of smaller donors (Arcus Foundation, Beneficia Foundation, USFWS, zoological gardens) are sponsoring the smaller NGOs and distinct projects focused on Bonobo conservation. Monetary support has slowly increased over time; however, the extent to which Bonobo populations outside protected areas is benefitting needs to be assessed. Fortunately, the Bonobo population does not need to be reinforced with individuals bred in captivity. In 2009 and 2011, Lola ya Bonobo, where intake rates and breeding have led to spatial constraints, released rehabilitated Bonobos back into the wild. The released individuals adapted easily to their new environment, became fully independent and reproduced successfully. Despite this success and the repopulation of a small area of former Bonobo habitat, reintroduction of great apes is controversial and often viewed as a mechanism for managing sanctuary populations (ABC 2014, C. André pers. comm.). Even more contentious are the potential ramifications for resident wild Bonobos, despite careful planning and selection of the site, and diligent preparation of the individual Bonobos released following IUCN guidelines for the reintroduction of great apes (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2007).</li></ol><p></p><p>In sum, for protection of Bonobos to be effective, commercial poaching must be halted, intensification rather than expansion of local agriculture&#160;must be supported, and local industries must be actively persuaded to support rather than subvert conservation objectives. The most urgent conservation measures needed are those that enhance Bonobo survival <em style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">in situ</em>: effective law enforcement; long-term project presence on the ground; population monitoring; and education at all levels of society.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

110023718,714,Ailurus fulgens,Endangered,A2cde+3cde+4cde,2015,2015-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Red Panda is listed as Endangered because its population has plausibly&#160;declined by 50% over the last three generations (estimated at 18 years) and this decline is projected to continue, and probably intensify, in the next three generations. There is no credible quantification of decline rate from anywhere in the species' range. The overall forest loss rate at appropriate altitudes&#160;in the species' range is suspected to be sufficient for Near Threatened status (about 25% in the last three generations), but Red Panda populations are suspected to be declining much faster, reflecting a battery of direct threats, this species' fragmented present range, and poor survival in fragmented areas. (1)&#160;Red Panda diet is 98% bamboo. These plants&#160;show mass flowering followed by die off. Red Pandas will not readily find new feeding grounds in a highly fragmented landscape and are exposed to other threats when crossing unsuitable habitat. These bamboos do not easily re-establish after flowering in areas of environmental degradation and deforestation, which are now widespread across the&#160;species's range. (2)&#160;Red Pandas are highly susceptible to canine distemper (even developing the disease after vaccination with&#160;domestic dog vaccine), which is lethal to them. As more people, particularly herders, encroach Red Panda habitat, contact between domestic dogs (and their excreta) and Red Pandas increases. Unless all dogs (including feral ones) in Red Panda habitat are vaccinated against this disease the chance that it will enter and spread in the wild Red Panda population with catastrophic consequences are high. (3)&#160;Red Panda has specific habitat requirements for forest type, altitude, slope gradient and aspect, proximity to water courses, precipitation and presence of tree stumps. The gentle slopes and rich bamboo understorey of Red Panda habitat make it also a prime choice for herders with their dogs. Cattle also prefer these more gentle slopes, so trample bamboo, which is also collected extensively by herdsmen and used for fodder. In addition tree stumps are often collected by local villagers for firewood. (4)&#160;Hunting for trade seems to be increasing, Red Pandas are starting to enter the pet trade, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of ‘cute’ images on social media. Deforestation and road building are easing access to Red Panda habitat. There are reports of poachers capturing Red Pandas in Nepal and Myanmar to satisfy the Chinese demand for the species (as wild meat, for medicine and for skins). The smaller population fragments, such as in&#160;Nepal, can support little or no off-take. (5)&#160;The human population in the Eastern Himalayas is growing at an average rate of 2.1% (doubling time 33 years). With this growth more people are moving into Red Panda habitat for their livelihoods, thereby exacerbating the above threats. Yonzon and Hunter (1991) showed that Red Panda mortality is high in disturbed areas; in their study area only three of the 12-13 cubs born survived to&#160;six&#160;months and only five of the nine adults survived the study period. They stated that 57% of these deaths were directly related to human causes. Comparable figures from undisturbed habitat are not available; but annual mortality rates such as these cannot possibly be&#160;sustainable.<br/><br/>The Ailuridae comprises a monospecific family. In part for this reason of conservation priority, with the evidence of precise decline rate being inadequate for certain discrimination between Vulnerable and Endangered, the precautionary course is taken of categorisation as Endangered, pending more precise information.","<p>Red Panda is closely associated with montane forests (oak mixed; mixed broad-leaf conifer; and conifer) with dense bamboo-thicket understorey (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). Conifer/fir forests seem to be preferred (Yonzon and Hunter 1991). Habitats above the tree-line are probably not consistently occupied given that Red Panda is essentially arboreal (Choudhury 2001). A dead Red Panda at 4,325 m asl in Arunachal Pradesh, in an area where the species is not generally known and far from any typical Red Panda habitat, was presumably a dispersant (Dorjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Six studies reported that Red Panda prefers to live near (typically within 100–200 m of) water (e.g., Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001). Five indicated a preference for canopy cover above 30%, with some suggesting cover as high as 70–80% may be preferred. Three suggested a preference for slopes of below 45%. Several indicated a preference for slope aspect: most suggest avoidance of south-facing slopes in favour of the cooler climate of the north, northwest and northeast aspects (Yonzon and Hunter 1991, Pradhan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Mahato 2004,&#160;Mallick 2010,&#160;Jhoshi and Sangam 2011,&#160;Subedi and Thapa 2011,&#160;Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Panthi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sharma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Sagamartha National Park, Red Panda was found on south-facing slopes in only one of six study areas, at lower density than at similar altitudes on north-facing slopes. In another area where both north- and south-facing slopes had otherwise similar habitat, Red Panda was found only on the north-facing slopes (Mahato 2004). Only in China have there been reports that Red Panda prefers south-facing slopes (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013). All studies investigating aspect took place in a similar altitude range. Also in China, in contrast to the rest of the range, steep slopes of more than 45% seemed preferred. Perhaps this relates to sympatry with Giant Panda <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>&#160;(in the Minshan, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling ranges in western Sichuan; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a, 2000), which uses the more gentle slopes. Zhang <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that Red Panda prefers microhabitats with higher densities of fallen logs and tree stumps.</p><p> Red Panda is largely vegetarian, eating chiefly young leaves and shoots of bamboo. It also takes fruit, roots, succulent grasses, acorns, lichens, birds' eggs and insects (Hodgson 1847, Sowerby 1932). It is largely arboreal (Hodgson 1847).<br/> <br/> Gestation in captivity lasts 114–145 days (Northrop and Czekala 2011), suggesting a variable delay in embryo implantation. The animals breed once per year giving birth in the summer (late May to early August in northern hemisphere zoos). In captivity, litter sizes range from one to four, most commonly one to two; quadruplets are exceedingly rare. In the field, Yonzon and Hunter (1991) reported litters usually of singletons or twins. The young are sexually mature at 18 months and females can give birth for the first time around their second birthday. In captivity the generation length is around five to six years and its average longevity around 12–14 years. This slow reproductive rate and relatively long generation time are typical of a k-selected species, adapted to a stable environment and less capable of survival when that environment starts changing rapidly.<br/> </p>","<p>Each of the three recent&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs)&#160;listed the threats to Red Panda assessed to be most prevalent in their country/countries. Several problems occur throughout the species's range, albeit with some variation in assessed impact. The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat degradation; and physical threats. These are all compounded by the region's increasing human population;<span class=""a1""> climate change; natural disasters; inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations; mostly low political will and interest; political instability (in some regions); low coordination of stakeholders, funding and human resources; trans-boundary issues facilitating poaching, illegal collection of non-timber forest products, and Red Panda trade (skins and other body parts); and the movement of cattle herders/grazers during the breeding season.<br/> <br/> <span class=""a1"">Natural disasters include cyclones; landslides; floods; heavy snowfall and rainfall; bamboo flowering (which results in death of the plant and typically occurs synchronously across large areas); forest fires; poor regeneration of shelter trees; weed infestation and invasive alien species; and disease outbreaks. Although most of these have been in operation throughout Red Panda existence, their effects are increasingly severe as an ever-larger proportion of the distribution is outside contiguous habitat blocks&#160;large enough&#160;for recolonisation to occur post-disaster.</span></p><p><span class=""a1""><span class=""a1""> In some areas, habitat is lost and degraded by commercial logging. In the Emaw Bum region of Myanmar more&#160;than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> have been logged since 1999–2000, resulting in many new roads into mountain areas, e.g. between the May Hka river and the China border. These logging roads not only&#160;destroy&#160;habitat&#160;directly, they also facilitate access for hunters and can destabilise the substrate. A recent video report from FFI shows two young Red Pandas crossing a landslide, the result of foreign road-building in the area.<br/> <br/> As human populations grow, more people move into mountain regions to live. They clear land for habitation, bring domestic herds to roam in the forests where they trample and eat bamboo. Herders collect bamboo for fodder and other necessities. The herds are protected by dogs that attack pandas and, if not vaccinated, potentially carry canine distemper, fatal to Red Panda. The lack of annual vaccination in India, at least, leads to a high incidence of canine distemper in dogs of one to five years of age (Latha <em>et al</em>. 2007). Spillover of canine distemper into wild species is already well documented, such as to Indian Fox <em>Vulpes bengalensis</em> (Vanak <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>&#160;(e.g. Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Himalayan bamboos, the Red Panda’s dietary staple, are sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire and overgrazing (Stapleton 1996). Reduced canopy cover increases wind and water stress for the bamboo. In these situations, seedlings are destroyed by the harsh conditions coupled with grazing pressure.<br/> <br/> Reports of Red Panda poaching and smuggling seem to be increasing, perhaps through demand in China.&#160;F. Momberg (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;saw Red Panda carcases and skins in&#160;villagers'&#160;homes in eastern Myanmar. One hunter allowed him to accompany him while he caught a Red Panda with his hands; apparently these villagers regularly take Red Pandas. Wildlife trade is rampant in Myanmar (about 30 tons of wildlife products per month), facilitated by wildlife habitat proximity to the Chinese border. Before Red Panda was upgraded to Appendix I of CITES in the early 1990s, individuals captured in Myanmar were traded by China to zoos around the world.&#160;<br/> <br/> Ang Phuri Sherpa (pers. comm. 2015) &#160;reported an increase in illegal trade over the preceding three years, based on the number of poachers and traders caught in Nepal. These incidents mostly involved skins and the items were headed for China. One incident involved a live Red Panda. A general increase in interest in Red Panda skins and meat in China could fuel more trade. A US businessman reported Red Pandas on offer in a restaurant. In the 'Threats' discussions during the 2012 Red Panda PHVA in China, many Chinese participants indicated that Red Panda meat was fairly widely available in restaurants, although no details are available. &#160;<br/> <br/> The live Red Panda trade, for pets, also seems to be increasing. Ian Lee (Chinese representative for Red Panda Network, pers. comm. 2015) found several reports in Chinese newspapers and social media of Red Pandas for sale as pets. This corroborates indications that Red Panda is increasing in popularity as a pet in China and other Asian countries, notably Thailand (YouTube videos and Instagram photos).<br/> <br/> Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) considers hunting and poaching the major threat to the Red Panda in Myanmar, in two ways: in one area, Red Panda is not a target species but is caught in iron traps, and some of skins are traded; in another, live Red Pandas are traded to China, motivating local people to go to catch them whenever they have time.<br/> </span></p>","<p>Red Panda was “estimated to be more common in the eastern part of its range, especially along the Myanmar-Yunnan border, yet it cannot be considered a common species” (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). There have been four undertakings to estimate, per country, the area of occupied habitat and from this the approximate Red Panda population: Choudhury (2001), Mahato (2010), the recent Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs; held in Nepal in 2010, China in 2012, and India in 2013) and Kendal <em>et al</em>. (2015). These show very little concordance (<span style="""">see Table 1 in the&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Supplementary Material</span>) and whilst some differences might reflect real change between earlier and later assessments, most must stem from differing assumptions and techniques. The PHVA figures are taken here as the most realistic guides, although none has been corrected for suitability of gross area of broadly suitable habitat accounting for specific preferences. Yet Red Panda is selective in forest used with regard to level of annual rainfall, percentage canopy cover, and density of bamboo (e.g., Yonzon <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). These would ideally all be taken into account when estimating area of potential habitat. In addition, Red Panda is usually found near water-courses and in areas with many tree stumps, and apparently prefers medium-gradient or shallower, north-facing slopes. In combination, these factors will make the area occupied at average to high densities substantially below that of potential habitat. For example, taking into account forest type, altitude, precipitation and slope aspect, Yonzon <em>et al. </em>(1991) estimated only 68 km<sup>2</sup> of the 1,719 km<sup>2</sup> Langtang National Park to comprise suitable Red Panda habitat.</p><p> Regardless of the uncertainty of actual area occupied, increases in human population and the continuing spread of human activity has driven habitat loss and degradation since the assessment of Choudhury (2001).<br/> <br/> <strong>Nepal</strong>. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i), with numbers low (317–582 – similar to the prediction by Yonzon <em>et al.</em> 1997) and a declining population fragmented into 11 subpopulations. These data are extracted from the PHVA report. Subsequent surveys of Api Nampa (Arjun Thapa pers. comm. 2014) and Khaptad (Hari P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011) did not confirm the survival of these two subpopulations. The following estimates of density/numbers have been reported:&#160;<strong>Rara: </strong>about one animal per 3 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly between 3,100 and 3,600 m asl because of fragmentation and disturbance below this, and reduced habitat suitability above; a maximum of 11 Red Pandas in a 35&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;study area (Sharma 2008, Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014). <strong>Langtang</strong>: one per 2.09&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;giving a total of 68 Red Pandas in the park (Yonzon 1989), but Yonzon <em>et al</em>. (1991)&#160;reassessed the Langtang population at 24. This apparent decline, of 65% in less than two to three years, was probably real, reflecting high mortality resulting from anthropogenic disturbance in the park. <strong>Panchthar – Ilam – Tapeljung:</strong>&#160;one per 5.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;– 100 animals in 178&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Williams 2003, 2004). <strong>Dhorpatan: </strong>animals present but no density or population estimates available<strong>.</strong> Most Red Pandas occur over 3,200–3,400 m asl (Subedi and Thapa 2011) or 3,000–3,800 m asl (Panthi <em>et al</em>. 2012), and suffer disturbance from local people for livestock and collection of forest products. <strong>Bhotkola:&#160;</strong>135&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;good Red Panda habitat holds about 30–46 Red Pandas (Joshi and Sangam 2011).<br/> <br/> <strong>India: the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. Participants in the 2013 PHVA calculated that the amount of habitat available for Red Panda in Sikkim and Arunachal was 6,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. More rigid constraints on assessing habitat as 'suitable' gave merely 2,600&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. Even with the more relaxed habitat conditions, this area is only half that proposed for India by Choudhury (2001), although the comparison is complicated by the non-availability of 2013 figures for West Bengal. Given the changes in land use in the last 20 year, the area of potential Red Panda habitat has undoubtedly declined, although direct comparison between PHVA data and those published by Choudhury is unwise: Choudhury estimated Red Panda habitat from forest service maps and national park maps, whereas the PHVA evaluation used current satellite imagery. In Sikkim, 225–370 Red Pandas in 650&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable forest were calculated by Ziegler <em>et al</em>. (2010); the PHVA estimate was of 44–415. In West Bengal (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">not included in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material</span>), a statement of 78 Red Pandas in Singalila (Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001) contrasts with a more recent one of 27 animals (Roka and Jha 2014) and a similar number stated by Bahaguna <em>et al</em>. (1998). This figure plus the 28–32 animals stated to live in the Neora Valley by Mallick (2010) gives a total of 55–60 Red Pandas in West Bengal. In Arunachal Pradesh there have been fewer site-specific studies. This state is presumed to hold the largest Red Panda population in India. According to Choudhury (2001) it was relatively common in Tawang and northern West Kameng districts and in the Mishmi Hills, especially Dibang Valley and Lohit districts. Ghose and Dutta (2011) reported sightings of Red Pandas from&#160;several&#160;districts, all from before 2000. Habitat maps suggest that most Red Panda habitat is in the east of the state, with a second concentration in the west, around Tawang and Eaglesnest. The habitat between these two regions looks more sparse and fragmented.<br/> <br/> <strong>Bhutan.</strong> Red Panda seems to be widely distributed, mostly at 2,400–3,700 m asl. Bhutan is a very small country with a fast developing economy. The road system is expanding fast and the growing rural population depends on forest and forest products. Even in this country, the pressure on Red Panda habitat is marked.<br/> <br/> <strong>Myanmar</strong>. The area where Red Panda is found (northern Kachin province) is remote, with recent locality records from Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, Mount Majed and Emaw Bum, mostly above 3,000 m asl. The number of villager captures suggests the species may be common in Hkakaborazi National Park, but none was camera-trapped there despite substantial effort at suitable altitude (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) believes Red Panda is still fairly common in the Emaw Bum region, albeit much disturbed by logging and hunting. Red Panda is presumably less common than formerly in Myanmar and, although apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, it is still caught and killed.<br/> <br/> <strong>China. </strong>China is the only country for which the PHVA estimated much higher forest cover than did Choudhury (2001). Choudhury’s (2001) estimates were supported by Wei <em>et al</em>. (1999, 2011). As Wei <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported, reforested lands (which are increasing, reflecting government policy) do not provide suitable Red Panda habitat. Red Panda perhaps decreased in China by as much as 40% in the second half of the twentieth century, through massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching (Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999). Wei <em>et al.</em> (1999) estimated 3,000–7,000 Red Pandas in China.<br/> </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The current Red Panda distribution is detailed in three Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs) since 2010, covering all range states holding the species: Nepal (2010), China and Myanmar (2012), and India and Bhutan (2013). As discussed by Roberts and Gittleman (1984),&#160;Red Panda&#160;distribution range should be considered disjunct, not continuous. Reports, including a shot animal of undoubted identification and provenance, of a population on the Meghalaya Plateau of northeastern India, in anomalously tropical habitat (Choudhury 2001, Duckworth 2011) warrant investigation as soon as possible. Captive&#160;Red Pandas from the main distribution and habitat do not breed well in tropical conditions (Princee and Glatston in prep); the Meghalaya Red Pandas, if native, might be a separate taxon.</p><p> In Nepal&#160;Red Panda&#160;has been reported from 23 districts, but a number lack confirmed specific records. A further district, Darchula, contains suitable habitat but so far lacks any Red Panda reports. The westernmost global reports are from the Api Nampa Conservation Area and Khaptad in far western Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), but specific verifiable records there have not been traced since the 2010 PHVA,&#160;even though local people had affirmed Red Panda in these areas in the recent past. Two post-PHVA surveys failed to find the species in either area (H.P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011,&#160;A. Thapa pers. comm. 2014). The westernmost confirmed records are from Kalikot and Jumla at about 81°E (Dangol 2014); both are west of the formerly accepted range. In Bhutan it is found in 13 districts (Haa, Thimphu, Paro, Punakha, Wangdiphodrang, Gasa, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Bumthang, Mongar, Lhuntse, Trashigang and Trashiyangtse); high-elevation areas in other districts (Chukha, Tsirang, Dagana, Samtse and Samdrupjongkhar) require further surveys (Dorjii <em>et al. </em>2012). In India it is found in only three states: Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. In Myanmar it is known only from the northernmost state, Kachin, and is locally distributed even there (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). In China it is found in three provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet. Sichuan is its main homeland. In this province its range extends through the Minshan and Liangshan to Qionglai and the Lesser and Greater Xiangling mountains (Wei <em>et al</em>.1999, 2011). It is believed to be extinct in the rest of its historical range in China, e.g. Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces (Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Xiaoxiangling population appears isolated from the other <em>A. f. styani </em>population(s). It is a small population and represents a different genetic type that should be considered as a separate conservation unit (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda was&#160;stated to inhabit Lao PDR by Cheminaud (1942) and Deuve (1972). Re-examination of Cheminaud (1942) reveals many significant internal inconsistencies and flaws. Hence, there is no evidence that Red Panda has ever occurred in Lao PDR (Duckworth 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda occurs in a narrow altitude band. Roberts and Gittleman (1984) gave a range of 2,500–4,000 m asl. Prater (1948) mentioned occurrence down to 1,500 m asl and Choudhury (2001) gave a typical range of 1,500–4,800 m asl, up to nearly 5,000 m asl in the summer. However all recent publications, excepting those discussing animals from Meghalaya, support the Roberts and Gittleman range as that typically occupied, notwithstanding sporadic reports above 4,000 m asl and down to 2,300 m asl. The occupied altitude varies across the range. This might result from any of: disturbance at lower altitudes; time of year of assessment (several authors indicate that Red Pandas migrate seasonally up and down the mountainside; e.g., Yonzon and Hunter 1991); aspect (with animals occurring higher on the warmer south-facing slopes); and potentially other factors.<br/> </p>","Red Panda is taken for various purposes including wild meat, medicine, pelts and pets. Levels of offtake are not well documented; nor are trends in offtake or geographical patterns of harvest and use. It has been&#160;suggested that the rising numbers in the internet pet trade in China are captive-bred, but this remains&#160;to be confirmed.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Red Panda is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I (www.cites.org). It is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972, the highest protection possible for a species in India (Choudhury 2001). It is also legally protected in Bhutan, China (where it is classed as a Category II species under the Wild Animal Protection Law; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a), Nepal (Glatston 1994) and Myanmar (by the Wildlife Act of 1994). In China, the species is Red Listed nationally as 'Vulnerable' under A2ace. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i),&#160;<br/> <br/> In Myanmar it is found in at least three protected areas: Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and Emaw Bum proposed National Park. It is difficult to determine how much of the Red Panda’s range in the country these protected areas cover. Hunting and, in Emaw Bum, logging are widespread within their confines.<br/> <br/> In Bhutan it is found in the following protected areas: Jigme Dorji, Thrumshingla and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks, Bumdeling and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuaries, Toorsa Strict Nature Reserve, biological corridors connecting these reserves, and the biological corridor connecting Thrumshingla and Royal Manas National Parks. It has also been recorded in the Royal Botanical Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Wangchuck Centennial Park (Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012). Potential Red Panda habitat in the country modelled using MAXENT and ArcGIS 9.3 revealed 46% of predicted Red Panda habitat is under protected areas (PAs), 16% is in biological corridors and 38% lies outside the PA system. However, even protected areas are subject to activities such as road construction, livestock grazing, subsistence agriculture (slash-and-burn in some areas), collection of forest resources such as timber and NTFPs, and domestic dog presence.<br/> <br/> In India it is found in 19 protected or otherwise managed&#160;areas: Lachung Reserve Forest, Kanchendzonga National Park (NP), Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary,&#160;the buffer and transition area of the latter two,&#160;Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), Pangolakha WLS, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary, Singalila NP, Neora Valley NP, Kamlang WLS, Eaglesnest WLS, Zemithang Valley Community Forest, Nuranang Valley Community Forest, Mehao WLS, Mandla-Phudung CF, Anjaw Reserve forest, Mechuka-West Siang CF, Mouling NP and Dibang WLS. It might also inhabit Taley Valley WLS, Pakhui WLS and Sessa Orchid Sanctuary. These protected areas cover about one-third of the species’s total potential habitat in India (Choudhury 2001). In the 2013&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA)&#160;workshop, 22 protected areas (outside Meghalaya) were identified as having potential habitat for Red Panda, some with only very small areas. Furthermore, the workshop participants identified medium to high levels of threat in these areas from&#160;two or more of development activities; fire; herders; firewood and non-timber forest product collection; illegal trade/'accidental' hunting; dogs (very prevalent); refuse; and habitat reduction. In Arunachal Pradesh (the state believed to have the largest Red Panda population in India) around 60% of the forest is under community ownership rather than having PA status. Also in Sikkim, 60% of potential Red Panda habitat falls outside the PA system. Enforcement of protective legislation, especially outside protected areas, is almost non-existent (Choudhury 2001).</p><p> China has 46 protected areas containing Red Panda (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2011), covering about 65% of the species’s habitat in China. Poor law enforcement in PAs was listed as a problem during the 2012 PHVA workshop (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2014). Livestock grazing and collection of non-timber forest products occur widely in these areas.<br/> <br/> Red Panda has been confirmed in nine of Nepal’s PAs: Sagarmatha NP; Makalu Barun NP; Langtang NP; Rara NP; Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (CA); Annapurna CA; Gaurishankar CA; Manaslu Conservation Area; and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. In all these PAs, habitat loss and degradation, poaching and dog problems and developmental activities have been rated as moderate to severe by participants in the Red Panda PHVA workshop (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Currently there is a Global&#160;Species&#160;Management Plan (GSMP) for Red Pandas held in zoos around the world. This plan is closely allied to&#160;current field&#160;conservation efforts. The three PHVAs were largely the initiative of, and funded by, the zoo community. The aims of the GSMP are to contribute both directly and indirectly to Red Panda conservation by: providing a genetically and demographically sustainable and behaviourally competent back-up population for the wild population; holding the potential to supply individuals for genetic or demographic supplementation or reintroduction programmes; educating and the raising of public awareness of Red Panda, its uniqueness and conservation needs; and providing financial, technical, scientific and other support and expertise to the planning and implementation of <em>in situ</em> conservation and research &#160; <br/> <br/> Priority conservation actions fall into four main categories:<br/> <br/> 1. <u>To protect against habitat loss</u>: improve and manage Red Panda habitats (including within corridors); improve connectivity, including across international borders; balance developmental activities by promoting eco-friendly and sustainable development with minimal impact on Red Panda habitat; increase areas under protection; implement better Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for all development programmes; engage political willingness and win support;  develop and implement landscape-level conservation policy, identifying unprotected Red Panda habitat and &#160;making legal provision for the declaration of Red Panda Community Conservation Areas.<br/> <br/> 2. <u>To reduce habitat degradation</u>: restore degraded habitats, plant bamboo; regulate tourism by the use of entry permits; zone PAs to define&#160;restricted-access zones in core areas for Red Pandas, facility  zones, and resource use zones, with restricted visitor access during the breeding season (set quotas for&#160;non-timber forest products); educate, sensitise, and promote community participation to reduce and mitigate threats to Red Panda and its habitat; promote the use of alternative energy and building materials; provide sustainable livelihoods; enhance range-land management, using native species; reduce livestock numbers, especially of&#160; unproductive breeds; develop an integrated agriculture, pasture and  agroforestry system; develop proper rubbish disposal systems; improve community stewardship in natural  resources management; improve fire-fighting, in part by training communities, developing a national fire fighting strategy, ensuring PA&#160;management plans include comprehensive coverage of forest fire (the implementation of a fire strategy including forest fire alert and monitoring system, forest fire mapping and zoning, provision of fire fighting equipment, and controlled burning to prevent fires).<br/> <br/> 3. <u>To reduce deaths of Red Pandas:</u>&#160;strengthen law enforcement and improve physical protection; enhance transboundary cooperation on both of the former; strengthen coordination/collaboration between  line agencies and other stakeholders; implement a reward and punishment system both for  communities and forest department; establish anti-poaching units (in community forests and PAs) with capacity building for front-line, anti-poaching staff; train customs officials; reintroduce captive-bred individuals to reinforce local populations; formulate a dog management plan to control, sterilise and vaccinate dogs; engage army personnel in border bases to keep their dogs in check and not let them roam free in Red Panda areas.</p><p> 4. <u>To improve awareness</u>: design and implement a dedicated awareness programme using radio, pamphlets, posters, and documentary film; secure adequate funding; improve conservation education (with a focus on Red Pandas) in schools; establish/strengthen Green Force Clubs; implement a Red Panda research programme, identifying priority research topics, and including regular monitoring of its habitat; develop a trans-national ‘Project Red Panda’.<br/> </p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It inhabits stagnant or slow-flowing natural and artificial wetlands, within or adjacent to evergreen, deciduous or swamp forests, on which it depends for roosting and nesting, usually in tree-holes. Although lowlands (below c.200 m) provide optimum habitat, it occurs up to 1,400 m, especially on plateaux supporting sluggish perennial rivers and pools. It has been described as ominvorous (Green&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005), with pondweed, small fish, aquatic snails, spiders and insects being consumed regularly (Green 1993).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Breeding season may vary across its range so that hatching coincides with the early wet season, when food supply may be more favourable (Green&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).

It may be particularly susceptible to loss of large trees with nesting holes<strong>&#160;</strong>(W. Duckworth&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006). The resultant small, fragmented populations are vulnerable to extinction from stochastic environmental events, loss of genetic variability, disturbance, hunting and collection of eggs and chicks for food or pets. While trade may be more of a local threat to the species, off-take for hunting, which goes relatively unreported, is a far more serious issue (Green 1993b).

Conservation action is benefiting one key population in Cambodia, but rapid declines are likely to be ongoing elsewhere across the range.<br/><p></p>","Inland, birds inhabit natural and human-modified wetlands, both open and forested. Coastal populations frequent mangroves and intertidal flats. It nests colonially in large trees, and historically on cliffs, often at traditional sites in or adjacent to wetlands. It utilises small wetlands within Asian dry forest, and can breed some distance from these; shrinking of pools during the dry season and limited availability can lead to overlap with human uses and resulting disturbance. <p></p>","Several threats are contributing to its decline, with their relative importance varying across its range. The loss of nest-sites through the felling of colony nest-trees is a major threat, particularly in Assam - extensive nesting colonies outside protected areas in the 1990s recorded drastic declines owing to the cutting  down of trees and drying up of some feeding sites (A. Choudhury<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2012). In many areas, drainage and conversion of wetland feeding areas, agricultural intensification, increased pesticide use and disturbance, the collection of eggs and chicks and the hunting of adults are major threats, while the spread of invasive water hyacinth <em>Eichhornia crassipes </em>may be an additional threat at least in Nepal. A recent and very serious threat, recorded in Nepal and Cambodia, is  the practice of poisoning pools to catch fish, which leads to incidental  mortality of this species <strong></strong>(Gyawali 2004, S. Browne <em>in litt</em>. 2005). Coastal populations are threatened by large-scale development, including aquaculture and the clearance of mangroves, while lowland wetlands are likely to be subject to a variety of threats including sea level rise, both directly but also through displacement of people, and conversion for plantation agriculture (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt. </em>2013). Key threats in Indonesia include the conversion of mangrove forest to fishponds and peatswamp forest to acacia plantations (M. Iqbal <em>in litt. </em>2013).

Subspecies <em>islandica </em>shows a distinct preference for large patches of dwarf-birch bog and marsh, particularly with abundant sedge-pools<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996, Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2006). Extensive farmland habitats are of critical importance for breeding Western European populations<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996), with y<span lang=""NL"">oung, that grow up in herb-rich meadows recruiting to the breeding population 2.5 times better than young that grow up in monocultures (Kentie <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In intensively managed grasslands small shallow pools attract breeding godwits and, in combination with herb rich meadows, may improve breeding succes (Weterings <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;After the young have fledged, adults and fledglings often move to secondary habitat which more closely resembles that of their non-breeding range, including wet damp areas around fish-ponds and sewage farms, tidal marshes, mud flats and salt-water lagoons (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, Tucker and Heath 1994)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>Subspecies <em>limosa </em>tends to winter in freshwater habitats<strong></strong>, including swampy lake shores, pools, flooded grassland and irrigated rice fields<strong></strong>. Subspecies <em>islandica </em>and <em>melanuroides</em>, however,<em> </em>often winter in saline habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996) such as sheltered estuaries and lagoons with large intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), sandy beaches, salt-marshes and salt-flats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996). Despite these general differences there is considerable overlap in wintering habitat between sympatric populations of subspecies <span style=""font-style: italic;"">limosa</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">islandica</span> (Alves <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Lopes <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Seasonally-flooded grassland is a critical habitat for the birds wintering in Ireland (Hayhow 2008). Birds on passage in Iberia make much use of rice fields (Lourenço <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (especially beetles), annelid and polychaete worms, molluscs, ragworms, crustaceans, spiders, fish eggs, and the spawn and tadpoles of frogs<strong> </strong>(Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996). On the breeding grounds grasshoppers and other orthopterans are often prevalent in the diet (Johnsgard 1981). Particularly during the winter and on migration it will also take plant material including berries, seeds and rice grains<strong> </strong>(Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, Lourenço <em>et al. </em>2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. On its wintering grounds in Portugal, the bivalve <em>Scrobicularia plana</em> has been found to represent its primary food source (Moreira 1994), while&#160;in the salinas of Spain, it mainly feeds on chironomid larvae (Estrella and Masero 2010).&#160;<span lang=""NL""><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is placed on the ground in short, often luxurious vegetation<strong> </strong>(Johnsgard 1981, Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It consists of a shallow scrape 12-15cm in diameter, lined with a thick mat of stem grass, leaves and other available vegetation (Cramp <em>et al.</em> 1983). Breeding birds show a high degree of nest site fidelity<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1996) and some degree of natal philopatry (Kruk <em>et al.</em> 1998) which is more pronounced among males (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2011). <p></p></span>","Loss of nesting habitat owing to wetland drainage and agricultural intensification, and conversely abandonment in some parts of the range, are the most significant threats (Mischenko 2008,&#160;Kentie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land and loss of habitat to development (Tucker and Heath 1994), increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland&#160;(Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), earlier and more frequent cutting as farmers adapt to climate change (Kleijn&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010), spring burning and scrub encroachment (A. Mischenko&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007)&#160;and possibly disturbance by walkers (Holm and Laursen 2009). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of egg and chick mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Kentie <em>et al. </em>2015). On intensively grazed pastures, trampling is a major cause of nest loss, and a switch to monoculture on arable land reduces the supply of insects on which the species feeds (Kentie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to silage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">A study in<span lang=""EN-US""> the central regions of <span lang=""EN-US"">European Russia suggests that<span lang=""EN-US""> <span lang=""EN-US"">significant decline in spring flood levels during two last decades, as a result climate change, has <span lang=""EN-US"">strengthened<span lang=""EN-US""> the negative impact of agricultural abandonment (<span lang=""EN-US"">A.

Indeed, sink locations have been documented for the species, where birds recruited from good quality habitat disperse to low quality habitats (often suffering high predation) effectively losing these individuals to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Leigh&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1980, Reijnen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996<strong></strong>). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)<strong></strong>.&#160;The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestion of the lowland habitats where they breed and from ongoing agricultural expansion (Gunnarsson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Gill&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007), although this population has been increasing strongly over recent decades (BirdLife International 2015).<br/>Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture, urban expansion and agricultural intensification at rice paddies. The proposed development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Masero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the European Union (EU) in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2008), which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, for example on the African wintering grounds, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact is unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species range (H. Hötker <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, although the effects of the release of some pollutants, like untreated sewage, on this species may be minor as long as there are several alternative prey present at a site (Alves <em>et al. </em>2012). In Egypt there are plans to increase the depth of the sailing channel of the Nile, impacting upon this species's habitat there (H. Ibrahim&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994) in conjunction with the extensive drainage of wetlands in this area, for energy production, water storage and agriculture (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Invasive plants may also degrade wintering habitat in Australia (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Studies of <em>islandica</em> godwits have shown that individuals breeding in the habitats where productivity is higher also winter in the areas where survival is higher (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds.&#160;<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).<strong>&#160;</strong>The population is estimated to number&#160;102,000-149,000 pairs&#160;in Europe (including 25,000 pairs in Iceland) (BirdLife International 2015); 25,000-100,000 in west-central Asia; 150,000 in central Asia and Siberia (Asian Waterbird Census unpublished data); 160,000 in the rest of Asia and Australia.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;has a large discontinuous breeding range extending from Iceland to the Russian far east, with wintering populations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Australasia<strong> </strong>(Van Gils <em>et al. </em>2017). It occurs as three subspecies, <em>L. l. islandica</em>, <em>L. l. limosa</em>, and <em>L. l. melanuroides</em>. Subspecies<em> islandica </em>breeds predominantly in <strong>Iceland</strong>, with much smaller numbers in the <strong>Faeroe Islands</strong>, Shetland (<strong>United Kingdom</strong>) and the Lofoten Islands (<strong>Norway</strong>). This subspecies winters in roughly similar numbers in the <strong>Republic of Ireland</strong>, the United Kingdom, <strong>France, Spain</strong>&#160;and <strong>Portugal</strong>, with small numbers in the <strong>Netherlands</strong> (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016). Subspecies<em> limosa </em>breeds across a wide area extending from Western Europe and central Europe to central Asia<strong> </strong>and Asiatic Russia, as far east as the River Yenisey. The west European population of this subspecies migrates south through France and Iberia to winter largely in West Africa, while eastern breeding birds winter in southeast Europe to the Middle East, and may also be the origin of wintering birds in <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Chad</strong> and northern <strong>Cameroon</strong> (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Oomen 2008, Lourenço &amp; Piersma 2008b).&#160;Subspecies<em> melanuroides </em>breeds in disjunct populations in <strong>Mongolia, </strong>northern <strong>China</strong>, Siberia (<strong>Russia</strong>) and the Russian Far East. These birds migrates across a broad front to winter from western South Asia to <strong>A</strong><strong>ustralia</strong>, encompassing&#160;<strong>India</strong>, Indochina, <strong>Taiwan, </strong>the <strong>Philippines, Indonesia, </strong>and Melanesia (Dutson 2011, Van Gils&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).<strong>&#160;</strong><br/>Population trends vary across the range. There have been large and well-documented declines in the mainland European breeding population (of the nominate subspecies) of between 50-60% (BirdLife International 2015). For example, in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>&#160;the population decreased dramatically from 120,000-135,000 pairs in 1969 and 85,000-100,000 pairs in 1989-1991, to just 46,000-62,000 in 2009 (Tucker and Heath 1994,&#160;<strong><sup> </sup></strong>BirdLife International 2004a, <strong></strong>EU Technical Report 19 2007, Oomen 2008, Höglund <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009), 35,200-59,800 pairs in 2008-2011 (BirdLife International 2015), and potentially to 33,000 pairs in 2015 (Kentie <em>et al. </em>2016). In certain areas though, the breeding population has recently stabilised as a result of agri-environmental measures (Oosterveld <em>et al. </em>2016). These declines are mirrored in the information from West African wintering areas, with notable declines in Senegal and Morocco, while further east (Mali, Chad and north Cameroon) wintering numbers appear stable, though data is sparser (Lourenço and Piersma 2008b). This is true also for the central Asian breeding population, which is thought to be stable of fluctuating (L. Belyalova<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>, but for which there is little recent data.&#160;In the eastern flyway, declines have been estimated at between 20-30% over three generations on the species Australian wintering grounds (Garnett <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010)<strong></strong>, which hold c. 50% of the wintering population of <em>L. l. melanuroides</em><strong> </strong>(Watkins 1993).&#160;The population of <em>L. l. ilsandica, </em>in contrast, has be increasing dramatically over the past few decades, although this increase may be levelling out and the subpopulation represents a relatively small part of the global population (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Wetlands International in press)<strong></strong>.&#160;A recent analysis based on published literature, survey data and expert opinions from throughout the species range suggests that, overall, the global population may have declined at a mean rate of approximately 23% over 25 years leading up to 2015 (I.

An EU management plan for 2007-2009 was adopted, and an AEWA action plan replaced it at the end of 2008 (Anon. 2008). Intensive management of breeding habitat has been carried out in some Western European countries (H. Hötker <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, and a number of agri-environment schemes focus on this species, although results have been mixed (Musters <em>et al.</em> 2001, S. Nagy <em>in litt. </em>2005,<sup>&#160;</sup>A. Mischenko <em>in litt. </em>2007, Verhulst <em>et al.</em> 2007). A number of significant wintering areas are protected areas, as are several breeding sites in the UK and the Netherlands.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Obtain more quantitative data on status, population trends and conservation requirements outside Europe. Carry out research on survival, recruitment, breeding and migration (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Critically evaluate the effectiveness of current conservation action. In the EU, use a mixture of agri-environment schemes, direct payments to wader-friendly farmers (Musters <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2001) and large reserves to secure protection and appropriate management of breeding habitat. The coverage of agri-environment schemes in Europe should be increased (Kleijn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and increases in groundwater depth should be prioritised as an outcome (Verhulst <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). New nature reserves should be established on important sites throughout the species range, and there should be attempts to get greater coverage of key areas for this species within in the Special Protection Areas network (van der Vliet <em>et al. </em>2015).  Manage existing reserves appropriately: prescriptions include avoiding drainage of existing wet meadows, raising water tables where necessary, low-level use of organic fertiliser, low intensity grazing, late mowing, and prevention of succession to bushy vegetation. Winter flooding is sometimes recommended but may reduce numbers of invertebrate prey (Gunnarsson <em>et al. </em>2005). On intensively farmed land, maintenance of unfertilised field margins has been shown to have positive effects (Oosterveld <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Investigate the potential for using a 'headstarting' approach to increase survival to fledging (J. Gill <em>in litt. </em>2016). Prevent afforestation of lowland breeding habitat in Iceland. Prevent a loss of key breeding areas due to abandonment of grasslands and meadows in east Europe and Russian Far East. Monitor human disturbance as a threat.&#160;<br/>Ensure that migratory staging posts and winter feeding habitats and roosts are conserved and monitored, and knowledge of them is improved (Estrella and Masero 2010). Designate a special protection area at Extremadura's rice fields, which is a key stopover site (Masero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Manage artificial habitats appropriately, e.g. maintain low water levels in salinas such that they are available to foraging godwits (Estrella and Masero 2010), and block drainage to retain water in Iberian rice fields (Lourenço and Piersma 2008a). Protect important Yellow Sea tidal flats in China and South Korea. Engage with governments and local people throughout its migration routes. Effectively enforce the EU-wide ban on hunting until there is clear evidence that the population has returned to a favourable conservation status. Safeguard habitats in West Africa and Iberia, perhaps by offering support to rice producers (Gill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Collaborate with farmers and hunters, carrying out environmental education and outreach work where appropriate. Restore wetland sites in Australia (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Ensure recognition as a protected animal throughout range (Hancock 2008).<br/><p></p>",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The population trend appears to be stable, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species makes little known (Ogilvie 1997) dispersive movements (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Nelson 2005) related to water conditions (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). It is locally nomadic in southern Africa in response to changing wetland conditions (Barnes 2000), and western African populations make northward movements into sub-Saharan steppe during the wet season, returning southwards in the dry season (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Johnsgard 1993). The species breeds all year round, although most start late in the wet season (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Johnsgard 1993, Nelson 2005). It is gregarious both during breeding and non-breeding (Langrand 1990), nesting in small groups or larger loose colonies of between 20 and 500 pairs (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Ogilvie 1997) (often alongside other species (Langrand 1990, Nelson 2005)). It roosts nocturnally in groups (Johnsgard 1993), but is more of a solitary feeder, preferring to fish singly or in small loose groups of less than 30 individuals (Langrand 1990, Johnsgard 1993, Nelson 2005). It is chiefly diurnally active, especially during the morning and evening, although it may also fish on moonlit nights (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Langrand 1990). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species inhabits a wide range of aquatic habitats, but prefers to feed in quiet backwaters and weed-grown lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) where there is shallow water and emergent vegetation (Langrand 1990), generally avoiding steep, vegetated lake margins (Nelson 2005). It shows a preference for freshwater lakes, swamps, large slow-flowing rivers, and seasonal pools (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Langrand 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Johnsgard 1993, Nelson 2005), but also frequents reservoirs (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Johnsgard 1993), seasonally flooded land (Nelson 2005) and flood-plains near river mouths (Ogilvie 1997). It may occur on alkaline and saline lakes and lagoons (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Langrand 1990, Johnsgard 1993, Nelson 2005), and can sometimes be found along the coast in bays (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and estuaries (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Langrand 1990, Nelson 2005) (although seldom on open seashore) (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Nelson 2005). The species tends to roost and breed in trees (e.g. mangroves), but will also roost on sandy islands, cliffs, coral reefs and sand-dunes (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Nesting trees are often killed by repeated nesting, which forces breeding colonies to move (although birds will usually not move far) (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> The diet of this species consists entirely of fish (of any size up to 450 g, although usually in the range of 80-290 g) (Nelson 2005), with cichlids (especially <em>Haplochromis</em> and <em>Tilapia</em>) being preferred (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Johnsgard 1993, Nelson 2005). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The species nests colonially in trees, reeds or low bushes along waterfronts (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Nelson 2005) as well as (less often) on the ground on sandy islands and in mangroves (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Nelson 2005). The nest is small and constructed of sticks (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), and may be situated at elevations of 10-50 m above the ground (Johnsgard 1993). A single tree may contain many nests (Nelson 2005) that can be very close together (often touching) (Ogilvie 1997), and a single pair will refurbish and re-use the same nest from year to year if it has not collapsed (Nelson 2005).","This species is threatened by habitat loss in KwaZulu-Natal, as many suitable pans and flood-plains are being altered through drainage and cultivation, and the natural flooding regime of pans in the Pongolo system has been altered by the Jozini Dam (Barnes 2000). In southern Africa disturbance of the species is increasing at estuaries as these areas become more intensively used and developed (Barnes 2000). The species is also susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins in their body tissue, which may lead to a decline in reproductive success (Barnes 2000). Destruction of nesting trees due to logging activities may be a local problem (Ogilvie 1997).",,Stable,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

However, these threats have ceased and the population may now begin to increase. Given the species's longevity it is retained as Near Threatened on the basis of the past declines. <p></p> <p></p>","Breeding takes place in burrows in sandy soil and rocky crevices. Birds attend colonies for at least 10 months of the year, arriving nocturnally to reduce predation by Western Gulls <em>Larus occidentalis </em>(Keitt <em>et al</em>. 2004) and ravens. Eggs are laid in March and hatching begins in early May (Keitt 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","On Natividad, in the past, predation by c.20 feral cats reduced the population causing &gt;1,000 recorded deaths per month prior to their eradication which reduced mortality to less than 100 per month (Keitt <em>et al. undated,</em><em>&#160;</em>2002). Road construction and the establishment of a small fishing community have decreased breeding habitat and burrows (Keitt 1998), and trampled burrows and lights continue to cause some mortality (Keitt and Albores-Barajas <em>unpublished data</em>). Introduced rodents in Isla Rasa, in the Gulf of California, have been successfully eradicated, but no population monitoring has been carried out since first nesting record occurred in 2010 (Velarde&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Predation by Western gulls and common raven can be easily observed both on chicks and adults, while eggs and young chicks are occasionally predated by white-tail antelope squirrel, <em>Ammospermophilus leucurus</em> (Albores-Barajas and Garcia <em>unpublished data</em>). The Guadalupe population is thought to be predated by cats (B. Tershy and B. Keitt <em>in litt.</em> 1999). It is possible that cat predation has caused the extirpation, or at the very least, significantly reduced populations of this species from the main island of Guadalupe (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). In 2003, remains were found on cliffs at the southwest edge of Guadalupe in excellent potential nesting habitat. It is not known if these observations indicate breeding or prospecting birds. The presence of habitat inaccessible to cats provides hope that this species may still breed in small remnant populations on the main island of Guadalupe (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). Calls from prospecting adults in the cliffs of Melpomene Arroyo, indicate birds are readily available to recolonize the main island in the absence of cat predation (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). On all islands, introduced herbivores (donkeys, goats, sheep and rabbits) have caused erosion (reducing soil for burrows), trampled burrows, and destroyed vegetation, and rabbits may have displaced birds from burrows (Keitt 1998, B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999). Gill-net fisheries may cause some mortality (Carboneras 1992d). The human population at Natividad Island has continued to increase, with more houses built over the last few years. Although the houses are concentrated on the town area, there is more human presence on the island. Also, from time to time there are mountain biking races organized on the island and the track runs through the colony. Although the bikes tend to stay within the race track, it might be that this causes some human disturbance to the burrowing seabirds.&#160;<p></p>","The total population estimated in 1998-1999 was around 80,000 pairs, and therefore 160,000 mature individuals. In 2016, aerial photography and GIS were used to count during the breeding season the total number of occupied and unoccupied burrows in Natividad Island. The counts gave a figure of 37,858 (±8510 SE) breeding pairs, and therefore about 75,600 individuals. This figure was based on the initial occupancy of burrows on February 2016. Of the initial number of occupied burrows, there were 4,543 (about 12% of the burrows occupied) which were initially occupied but later abandoned by the birds (Albores-Barajas <em>et al. in press</em>).<br/><br/>Counts produced much lower numbers than previous estimates. It is likely that the methods used in 1998-99 overestimated the population size. The author extrapolated counts of nests in selected areas to the whole surface of the island used by birds without considering that there were large areas without any burrow. During the last survey, thanks to aerial photography, it was possible to precisely count all the burrows which were actually present (Albores-Barajas <em>et al. in press</em>). The total number of burrows counted, including occupied and abandoned burrows, was 56,395 with a relatively low occupancy (between 75% and 50% depending on the area).<br/><br/>Between 2014 and early 2016 the birds on Natividad were also affected by the presence of a wire fence next to the local rubbish dump and on the trajectory used by bird when moving from colony to sea. Several carcasses were found during the survey in February 2016. When the situation was analysed using thermal cameras, it was observed that at least 20 individuals collided with the fence every day, resulting in seven dead individuals/day. This mortality rate was estimated equivalent to the predation of five cats (Albores-Barajas<em> et al. in press</em>). The fence was immediately removed after the observations when it was communicated to the local community and to the Biosphere Reserve.",Unknown,"<p><em>Puffinus opisthomelas</em> breeds on six islands or small islets (including Guadalupe -and its islets-, San Benito- East, Middle and West- and Natividad), off the Pacific coast of <strong>Mexico</strong>.

Human population pressure, grazing pressure from livestock, hunting and changing patterns of land-use are resulting in its decline within this habitat, so it qualifies as Vulnerable. Some recent information puts the population size at a lower level than was previously estimated; however, it is not thought likely that all subpopulations are very small, so its status is currently retained as Vulnerable. <br/><p></p>","It is resident in precipitous, rocky terrain dominated by scrub, tall grass and scattered clumps of trees, most frequently from 1,445-3,050 m, but occasionally down to 950 m at least (Bisht <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Occupied sites are characterised by a combination of low shrubs subject to regular browsing and cutting, with grass growing through spring and summer being widely harvested for livestock fodder in the autumn. It has been recorded in regenerating coniferous and broadleaved forests, as well as juniper and rhododendron on grassy slopes  (Subedi 2003). Its preference for early successional habitats, often created by traditional grass cutting and burning regimes, has led to an association with human settlements (and therefore high susceptibility to hunting). It digs for roots and tubers, and also eats seeds, berries, insects and grubs (Ali and Ripley 1987). It has been recorded breeding in India in May, June and September with clutch sizes of 6-12 eggs (Bisht <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p>","Having been widely shot for sport in the early 20th century, it is still hunted for food, and its eggs are collected for local consumption. Indeed, hunters in Nepal claim that they can trap up to 50 birds in one session through the use of snares and live decoys (Singh 2009), methods that are widespread in the species's range (P. Garson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2009). Hunting pressure in Nepal may be exacerbated by increased gun-ownership following the Maoist insurgency, especially in the west of the country (C. Inskipp <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2009). The species is hunted in remote  areas to provide a traditional treatment of asthma, body pain and fever, and it may be traded locally, although in some areas  local people strictly prohibit hunting (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral <em>in litt. </em>2013).<br/>  <p>The patchy nature of its specialised habitat may render the smallest isolated populations vulnerable to extinctions, and higher levels of disturbance, grazing and the felling of wooded ravines now pose a substantial threat. In particular, hunting pressure and habitat destruction by fire and overgrazing have been implicated in its decline in Pakistan (Subedi 2003). However, burning, grazing and timber collection are also important in maintaining the open successiional habitats which the species favours, and healthy populations have persisted in some heavily grazed sites such as the Chail and Majathal Wildlife Sanctuaries in Himachal Pradesh (P. Garson <em>in litt. </em>2013). Significantly, Singh <em>et al. </em>(2011) found no correlation between Cheer Pheasant density and either grass cover or measures of grazing pressure in Dhorpatan Valley, Nepal, suggesting that current levels of&#160; exploitation were not adversely affecting the species. However the conversion of grassland to permanent arable terraces is reducing available habitat, as are schemes to plant mid-altitude grasslands with forest. Nest disturbance by dogs has also been identified as a threat.</span></p>Hydroelectric projects (HEPs) have been planned in almost all major rivers and their tributaries in Himachal Pradesh (S. P. Dhiman <em>in litt. </em>2013). A large area of Majathal Wildlife Sanctuary is under threat from submergence due to the construction of the Kol Dam upriver on the Sutlej River, and large-scale dam projects also threaten sites in the Beas Valley (V. Jolli <em>in litt. </em>2013). A total of 125 planned HEPs in the major river basins include 43 HEPs in the Sutlej catchment, 45 in the Beas , 26 in the Ravi &#160;and 11 in the Yamuna (S. P. Dhiman<em> in litt. </em>2013). </span><br/><p> Many populations in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand lie outside the protected area network and hence are vulnerable to illegal trapping and hunting (R. Kalsi <em>in litt. </em>2013). Furthermore, in June 2013 the boundaries of many protected areas were redefined to exclude villages, and some important habitats near human habitations (including Majathal, Chail and Kalatop Khajjiar) are now excluded from the protected area network, leaving them at greater risk of over-exploitation and development (S. P. Dhiman <em>in litt. </em>2013).</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p></p>","The population was formerly estimated to number 4,000-6,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 2,700-4,000 mature individuals (R. Kaul <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Subsequent surveys of previously-studied sites in Himachal Pradesh showed evidence of significant declines and even disappearance from some sites, suggesting that a revised population estimate could be 3,000–4,000 individuals (R. Kalsi pers. comm., in Rahmani 2012), roughly equating to 2,000-2,700 mature individuals. &#160;More recent regional estimates suggest that the total population may be considerably larger: while no more than 1,500 individuals are estimated to survive in Nepal, in Pakistan a significant breeding population persists in Jhelum valley which could be as large as c.2,490 pairs (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2014), and additional numbers in the Kahuta valley may increase the total further. The global total may therefore prove to be larger but the current estimate of 2,000-2,700 mature individuals is maintained until larger numbers can be confirmed.<br/></span>",Decreasing,"<em>Catreus wallichii</em> occurs in the western Himalayas from north <strong>Pakistan</strong>, through Kashmir into Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, <strong>India</strong>, and east to central <strong>Nepal</strong> (BirdLife International 2001). It has always been reported as uncommon with a patchy distribution owing to its specialised habitat requirements, which often bring it into close proximity to human populations (K. Ramesh <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. Many subpopulations are thought to number fewer than ten individuals, living in small pockets of suitable habitat. <br/><br/>In Pakistan, the species is currently surviving in two main valleys, Jhelum and Kahuta. Jhelum valley, which holds the largest known population of the species in Pakistan, has three main locations ( Pir-Chinasi, Gari Doppata and Chinari) where mean density was estimated at 11.8±6.47 pairs per km<sup>2</sup> (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2014). In Kahuta valley in District Haveli , 17 calling locations were recorded from eight survey plots (Awan<em> </em>2013). &#160;Evidence of presence in Machiara National Park is available, suggesting its re-establishment in the park area.&#160; There are possible new sites around Muzaffarabad, PirLasura NP and Masehra District of Khyber Pakhtoonkhawa (M. N. Awan, pers. obs.), however, no signs of the species were found during general bird surveys in Salkhala Game Reserve, which may reflect its local extinction there (Awan et al. 2012).</span><br/><br/>In India it has also declined, with most known populations now confined to Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The areas in and around Majathal Wildlife Sanctuary and Chail Wildlife Sanctuary in Himachal Pradesh appear to be important, but there are other unprotected grasslands in Uttrakhand that might support substantial numbers. The population in the Kai-i-nag and Poonch areas of Kashmir is also thought to be sizeable (Srivastava and Kaul 2007) A recent survey (Poddar <em>et al.</em> 2015) undertaken in three districts of Himachal found the species persisting at sites from where they were confirmed three decades ago, and located new populations. However, certain sites where they were found earlier (eg. Kaksthal, Tundah, Bhatal and Thathana in Chamba, Himachal) may have lost the species (R. Kalsi pers. obs.).  <br/><br/>  <p>In Nepal, it appears to be localised, occurring from the Baitadi district in the west to the Kali Gandaki river. The most important area in the country is Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Surveys conducted here in 1981 and 2003 revealed a slight decline, with a population estimate of 127-212 birds in the valley, but the downward trend was not statistically significant (Subedi 2003). Areas surrounding Dhorpatan have also been found to support populations at similar densities of 5-12.5 birds/km<sup>2</sup>, with populations in Surtibhag, Phagune, Bobang and Muri areas estimated at 37 (± 9), 167 (± 16), 67 (± 10) and 101 (±10) pairs respectively, with no apparent change in population since surveys in 1981 (Singh <em>et al.</em> 2011). Small populations were identified at Trikuta and within Rara National Park in 2005 and local reports during that survey indicated that the species occurs more widely within Mugu and Jumla districts (Bhudathapa 2006). Surveys in Rara National Park in 2006 and 2008 indicate that the population there is no longer viable, while anecdotal evidence from local shepherds suggests that the species is in decline (Singh 2009), and visiting birdwatchers are finding it more difficult to locate the species there (C. Inskipp <em>in litt.</em> 2009), as well as at Ghansa, but the level of threat is thought to remain low in parts of its range (Acharya and Thapa 2003). The total Nepalese population is thought likely to number fewer than 1,500 individuals (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral <em>in litt.</em> 2012). The number of new locations discovered following recently increased survey effort indicates that additional areas of suitable habitat will be found to support the species. For instance, significant numbers have recently been found in the Bajura district, in far western Nepal (C.

The taxon is subject to population fluctuations due to disease and effects of severe winter conditions. However, several recent authorities agree on a figure of approximately 1,000,000 and the range is expanding towards the north-west. Annual monitoring of the status of this species is required as an upsurge in illegal hunting in conjunction with adverse climatic conditions or outbreak of disease could result in a sharp fall qualifying for a classification of Near Threatened or Vulnerable.","Inhabits rolling arid steppes and grassy plains; in particular feather grass (<em>Stipa </em>spp<em>.)&#160;</em>steppes and sometimes semi-deserts (Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997). Mongolian Gazelles move constantly over their range in search of food, except during the rutting and birthing seasons.","The major threats to this species are disease outbreaks,&#160; illegal hunting, habitat conversion, habitat fragmentation, and severe winters. Illegal hunting (in addition to the legal harvest) is an increasing threat and male-biased hunting before and during the rut could have serious consequences for the fecundity of the population (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).<br/><br/>The Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway is double-fenced and has effectively cut off the smaller western populations from the core population in eastern Mongolia (Ito <em>et al.</em> 2005), although the large population and high mobility of the species has allowed sufficient gene flow (Okada <em>et al.</em> 2015). Outbreaks of disease and severe winters result in sporadic heavy mortality. Increasing livestock numbers has led to an increase in associated disease transmission (e.g. bacterial pneumonia caused by<em> Pasteurella</em>, viral influenza, foot-and-mouth, and anthrax) (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997, Schaller and Lhagvasuren 1998, Nyamsuren <em>et al. </em>2006).&#160;The distribution of Mongolian Gazelle is influenced by the activity of the vole <em>Lasiopodomys brandtii</em>. For example, in the 1990s a large increase in the <em>L. brandtii</em> population destroyed a huge area of pasture in Sukhbaatar and Dornod provinces and the gazelles disappeared from these areas and moved north (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).","Population estimates over the last 10 years have ranged from 400,000 to 2,700,000.

Most of the current population is found in the eastern Mongolian steppes. Smaller populations are found in central and western Mongolia. Some move south into China in winter where at one time up to 250,000 may occurred.

Smaller populations are still found in central and western Mongolia where they were previously abundant (Zahler <em>et al.</em> 2004). There is a translocated population on Homin Tal steppe in Zavkhan Province of west-central Mongolia. In the past 50 years, the geographic range of the Mongolian Gazelle has been reduced by about 76%. The vast majority of Mongolian Gazelles are now found in Mongolia itself; and within Mongolia the species is found in large numbers in only four provinces: Dornod, Khentii, Sukhbaatar and Dornogobi (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997) and in smaller numbers in other provinces.","The species is harvested for meat, hides and use of body parts (horn,&#160;liver, heart, lungs, kidneys and fat)&#160;in Asian medicine.&#160;Locally the tanned hides are used to produce chamois and the horns are made into handles for knives and various household articles (Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997). From the horns of young Mongolian Gazelles, the Institute of National Medicine under the Ministry of Public Health of the Mongolian People's Republic produced a drug named 'procaprin', which is said to exert sedative and tonic effects (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997, Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997).&#160;Former tight control in Mongolia has weakened during the last decade and tens of thousands (80-85 per cent of which are thought to be males) are killed illegally on top of the official harvest (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).

Identify and implement suitable conservation actions to maintain scrub habitats (Maclean and Sharpe 2015). Lobby against quarrying and proposed mining activities that threaten existing habitat. Take a precautionary approach regarding habitat management (Anon. 2010). Expand conservation awareness programmes and promote alternative livelihoods in and around areas supporting populations to minimise habitat alteration, disturbance and trapping (Anon. 2010).

The species may warrant downlisting in the future should data prove that the recent increase in its known range also corresponds to an increase in the known population. <p></p>","Its ecology is poorly known. It occurs in subtropical and tropical forest, with recent records from sites close to streams, rivers, reservoirs and rice-fields (close to or within forest). Its ability to persist in modified habitats is also demonstrated by its presence as a breeding species in a low-integrity plantation forest in Nanning (He Fenqi<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2007a) and secondary pine forest on reservoir islands in Zhejiang (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">per</span> Eames and Le Manh Hung 2009). Its diet includes small fish, shrimps and invertebrates, and it appears to be almost entirely nocturnal (Pilgrim <em>et al. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. The species does not nest in heronries and lays 3-5 eggs<strong> </strong>(Li <em>et al</em>. 2007). <p></p>","A key threat is forest clearance and fragmentation, primarily as a result of demands for timber and agricultural land in an extremely densely populated region. Although the species can nest in human modified habitats, vulnerability of monocultures to pest invasion is a risk<strong> </strong>(Fellowes <em>et al</em>. 2001). Human disturbance may cause this secretive bird to abandon eggs while incubating (Li <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Hunting is a major additional threat, even inside protected areas, and it may be particularly vulnerable when nesting. The decline or disappearance of the birds in Hubei and parts of Guangxi and Guangdong has been attributed to habitat damage and direct hunting (He Fenqi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007a). In Guangxi, the number of birds seen in markets outnumbers records in the wild. In recent years, a relatively high number of specimens have been collected, including those to supply scientific purposes, notably at Chebaling and Shennongjia (He Fenqi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007a). This, like capture for food, is illegal in China. Direct habitat damage for dam construction, river regulation and road building has driven birds from known sites, but counter-intuitively these activities also create new habitats in some cases. It appears that most areas of suitable habitat in Vietnam are subject to pressure from deforestation and hunting (Eames and Le Manh Hung 2009, Pilgrim <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, Walsh 2010), with overfishing and the intensive use of agricultural chemicals also being widespread (Pilgrim <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). The impact of chemical pesticides and fertilizers is unknown. Other threats affecting Ba Be National Park, Vietnam, include firewood collection, harvesting of non-timber forest products, occupation of agricultural land within the park, cattle-grazing, water pollution and sedimentation (Eames and Le Manh Hung 2009, Walsh 2010<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>).&#160; <p></p>","Brazil (2009) has estimated the population in China at fewer than 100 breeding pairs. The global population is estimated at c.250-999 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2001; M. Crosby <em>in litt</em>. 2005). This estimate equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals. Recent records confirm the species occurs in a wider range than previously thought, and the global population size could be shown to be larger (He Fenqi <em>in litt. </em>2016), but&#160;it is tentatively retained in the current range (J. Kushlan <em>in litt. </em>2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Gorsachius magnificus</em> is known from southern <strong>China</strong> and northern <strong>Vietnam </strong>(BirdLife International 2001).

There are records from Hunan, Hubei, Zheijian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Xinping, Guangdong, Yunnan, Fujian, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces, and it was last recorded on Hainan in 1962 (Gao Yuren 2003, <strong></strong> Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden 2003,<strong> </strong>He Fenqi and Lin Jiansheng 2004, <strong></strong>He Fenqi <em>et al</em>. 2007a,b, M.

The species departs its wintering grounds again from February through to May, although non-breeders may remain in the wintering areas all-year-round (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. During the winter the species usually forages singly or in small groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> occasionally aggregating into flocks of several thousand individuals, especially at roosting sites (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on upland moors, peat bogs, swampy and dry heathlands, fens, open grassy or boggy areas in forests, damp grasslands, meadows (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, non-intensive farmland in river valleys<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>, dune valleys and coastal marshlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) <em>Non-breeding</em> During the winter the species frequents muddy coasts, bays and estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> with tidal mudflats and sandflats (Snow and Perrins 1998), rocky and sandy beaches with many pools (Johnsgard 1981,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Snow and Perrins 1998), mangroves, saltmarshes (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal meadows and pasture (Johnsgard 1981, Navedo <em>et al. </em>2013) and muddy shores of coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981), inland lakes and rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It also utilises wet grassland and arable fields during migration (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists chiefly of annelid worms and terrestrial insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera and Orthoptera) (Johnsgard 1981) especially during the summer (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), although it will also take crustaceans, molluscs, polychaete worms (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, spiders (Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, berries and seeds, as well as occasionally small fish, amphibians, lizards, young birds and small rodents (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression on the ground or on a mound (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong></strong> in the open or in the cover of grass or sedge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Management information</strong> A study into the effects of shellfish harvesting by hand in coastal intertidal habitats recommends that the harvesting load should be limited to -1 during this species's autumn migration (Navedo and Masero 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","The species is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of moorland habitats as a result of afforestation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and of marginal grassland habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and improvement (Johnsgard 1981,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Baines 1988,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) (e.g. drainage, inorganic fertilisation and reseeding) (Baines 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species also suffers from high egg and chick mortalities due to agricultural practices (e.g. Tuellinghoff &amp; Bergmann 1993, Grant 1997, Fisher &amp; Walker 2015) human disturbance (Boschert and Rupp 1993) and higher predation rates if nesting on improved grasslands or in fragmented landscapes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Valkama and Korpimäki 1999, Douglas <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Conversely some populations have declined following abandonment of farmland and subsequent increases in the height of vegetation (Broyer and Roche 1991), rendering large areas unsuitable for nesting. Climate change is projected to have a large negative impact on this species during the breeding season (Huntley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Renwick <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Expansion of renewable energy projects including wind farms can also have an impact although more studies are required (Pearce-Higgins <em>et al.</em> 2009).

It has already undergone precipitous declines in South-East Asia but its status currently appears more secure in India.","It favours riverbed shingle and rocks, stony banks and mud around large lakes, but sometimes visits nearby grassy flats and also occurs infrequently on coastal beaches and estuaries. It is thought to be largely sedentary, but undergoes local movements forced by rising water levels (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em>1996).","Nest predation by dogs, disturbance by fishermen and domestic animals,  and opportunistic harvesting has caused chronically low breeding success  of riverine nesting birds throughout South-East Asia (Goes in press). In Nepal the species is seriously threatened by disturbance and the degradation and loss of its riverine habitat. The multitude of hydroelectric dam  projects completed, underway and  planned on large rivers in its range,  which threaten to alter flow  regimes and inundate nesting habitat downstream, is now perhaps the most significant threat across much of the range. On the Sesan and Sekong rivers in Cambodia, the species has nearly disappeared (A. Claassen <em>in litt. </em>2013). This recent precipitous decline on the Sesan is probably due to upstream Vietnamese dams (sudden water level rises inundating nests), and imminent extinction there seems unavoidable, and with further dams planned the fate of the small Sekong population does not seem more promising, even if appropriate conservation actions are implemented (Goes in press). Planned hydro-power dams on the main Mekong channel in southern Laos,  at Stung Treng and Sambor (Kratie) would lead to major alteration of flood regimes and river ecology if built, and could arguably lead to regional extinction in the medium term (Goes in press).","The population size has not been estimated here, but the species has been described as locally common (Hume and Kirwan 2017).",Decreasing,"<em>Esacus recurvirostris</em> occurs across a wide range in southern Asia, being found in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Iran, Pakistan</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sri Lanka, Nepal</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bhutan</span>,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Bangladesh</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Myanmar</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Thailand</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Laos</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cambodia</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Vietnam</span> and southern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span> (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).

However, the species may be discovered at new locations in the future, now that its distinctive calls are known.  <p></p>","It is found in lowland primary forest, preferring riverine or swampy areas (Dranzoa <em>et al.</em> 1999; McGowan 1994)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In Uganda, it occurs in both unlogged and logged forest (Sande 2001)<strong></strong>, including mixed forest subject to moderate logging and/or disturbance, or where natural gaps occur (Dranzoa <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Records from forest edge and non-forest habitats may refer to dispersing or feeding birds (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2004a, 2004b)<strong></strong>. It prefers to forage in areas of dense understorey with a tall, dense canopy and sparse ground vegetation  (Sande 2001; Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2004b)<strong></strong>. Dense canopy cover indicates mature forest containing suitable breeding and roosting sites (Sande <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010), and a dense understorey indicates the presence of preferred feeding habitat; two habitat characteristics that rarely coincide  (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2004b)<strong></strong>. It searches the leaf-litter for invertebrates, shoots, seeds and bulbs (McGowan 1994)<strong></strong> and probably picks invertebrates from low vegetation (Sande 2001)<strong></strong>. It is highly territorial and breeds throughout the year, though mainly towards the beginning of the rainy season (Sande 2001)<strong></strong>. Most nests are placed on the ground between the buttresses of large trees (Sande 2001)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The primary threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss through logging and clearance of forest for charcoal burning and agriculture  (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2004b)<strong></strong>. Fragmentation alone probably does not adversely affect the species, but it does appear to be affected by habitat changes associated with human-induced fragmentation, such as the extensive removal of large trees  (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2004b)<strong></strong>. Its habitat in Mabira Forest is highly degraded (Dranzoa <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong> and the rapid loss of forest here suggests that the francolin population may be declining (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2004a, 2004b)<strong></strong>, making this the most threatened population in Uganda<strong></strong>. Plans to raze 7,100 ha of Mabira and sell off the land for sugar production have been suspended (Anon. 2007). While logging in Bugoma Forest may not directly threaten the species, increased disturbance and poaching by pit-sawyers may reduce its population (J. Lindsell <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong><sup> </sup></strong>-<strong><sup> </sup></strong>both forests are surrounded by agricultural settlements, industrial development and urban areas (Dranzoa <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. A new wave of invasion by  veterans and refugees (arriving from DR Congo) is claiming the remaining chunks of Bugoma and  Budongo forests, with an estimated 5,000 ha of Bugoma forest subject to  encroachment by about 1,000 families and pit-sawyers for settlement in  2011-2012 (C.

Hunting in DRC has not yet been investigated but may be a more serious problem (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2004a)<strong></strong>.

Occasionally, it nests amongst low vegetation or lines nests&#160;with&#160;vegetation (F. A. Schmechel <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. It lays two to three eggs, usually in a simple scrape in sand or shingle (Heather and Robertson 2015, Moore 2009)<strong></strong>. It starts breeding from three years old and most pairs attempt breeding each season (98%); productivity is highly variable, depending on year, location, and level of management (Schmechel and Paterson 2005, Moore and Reid 2009).&#160;The oldest recorded bird lived for a minimum of 30 years (Moore 2013)<strong></strong>.

In some areas of Chatham Island, pairs may nest close to the tideline because introduced marram grass has reduced open areas further back on the beach (Schmechel and Paterson 2005, Moore <em>et al. </em>2012). Predation by native birds, especially weka <em>Gallirallus australis, </em>causes some egg losses (Moore and Reid 2009). South East and Mangere Islands are free of mammalian predators, but population sizes are small and variable, and the reason for decline on South East is unknown (Schmechel and O'Connor 1999). On Chatham and Pitt Islands, disturbance by people may affect breeding success (Aikman <em>et al. </em>2001). Hunting and collecting for museums may have had a significant effect on the species in the past (Dowding and Murphy 2001, Moore 2008).

In 1987-1988, the population was estimated at 100-110 birds, including 44 breeding pairs: eight on South East Island (= Rangatira), 25 on Chatham Island, nine on Pitt Island and two on Mangere Island. In 1998, a census indicated 140-150 birds, representing a significant increase. Numbers on South East, however, appear to have gradually declined since the 1970s (Schmechel and O'Connor 1999) and a slow decline continues (J.E. Dowding <em>in litt. </em>2016). Very small numbers may breed some smaller islands and stacks.

Recently, intensive predator control combined with nest manipulation between 1998 and 2004 resulted in high annual productivity and a sharp rise in the total population.

It favours high and dry areas on steep river banks and precipices, low hills, rock outcrops and rocky islands (Kear 2005). Less commonly it inhabits low islands in lowland areas (Kear 2005). Vegetative cover in its preferred habitats is usually thin and includes dwarf birch&#160;<em>Betula</em>, willow&#160;<em>S</em><em>alix</em>, and dead grass (Kear 2005).&#160;During the non-breeding season it inhabits open steppe and open rolling lowland hills, feeding among steppe, coastal lines, pasture, stubble and crop fields (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Throughout the day it flies to coastal and freshwater lakes to drink (Kear 2005). Occasionally it also roosts at these lakes, using the middle of the water or remote shallow areas and muddy and sandy beaches with low aquatic vegetation (Kear 2005). It will also roost on frozen lakes or on the sea (Kear 2005). The distribution of geese from year to year depends a lot on differences in lake water levels.&#160;On its breeding grounds it feeds primarily on Fabaceae and to a lesser extent grass leaves and the shoots of cotton-grasses&#160;<em>Eriophorum angustifolium</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>E. scheuchzeri</em>&#160;(Rosenfeld and Volkov 2001), as well as some&#160;<em>Carex and Equisetum</em>&#160;spp. (Kear 2005).<em>&#160;</em>Wintering geese feed on winter wheat, barley, maize, pasture and steppe grasses and, in Greece, natural grassland (Kear 2005). In Kazakhstan on passage they feed mainly on spilled grain on the fields after harvesting the wheat crops in autumn. They also feed on arid-adapted herbs such as&#160;<em>Salicornia&#160;</em>(Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. At migration staging areas the diet is thought to consist largely of grass shoots, supplemented with tubers and rhizomes (Kear 2005), as well as the salt marsh’s galophyte complex of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Puccinellia distans</span>&#160;and&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Aeroplus littoralis</span>&#160;(Rozenfeld 2011b, Simeonov and Possardt 2012).<strong>&#160;</strong><br/><br/>The species nests in hollows and fissures in the ground, usually 50-80 mm deep and 200 mm in diameter (Kear 2005). They are often constructed near to the eyries of birds of prey (Kear 2005), since breeding success may depend on nesting Peregrine Falcon&#160;<em>Falco peregrinus</em>, Snowy Owl&#160;<em>Bubo scandiaca</em>&#160;and Rough-legged Buzzard&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Buteo lagopus</span>&#160;providing protection from predators (Quinn&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Prop and Quinn 2003, Quinn&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, S.

Successful breeding seasons are also associated with good lemming years, and it has been suggested that this may be because predators are sated by the lemming population and so predation of geese is much lower.<br/><br/>This species is highly migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Following the post-breeding moult it migrates southwards over land in mid- to late-September (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, arriving on its wintering grounds in October-November. Here it is highly gregarious and occurs in flocks, regularly in association with the White-fronted Goose <em>Anser albifrons</em> (Madge and Burn 1988) Lesser White-fronted Goose 				<em>A. erythropus </em>and Greylag Goose<span style=""font-style: italic;""> A. anser</span>. The return journey is made between March and May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>, often together with <em>A. albifrons</em> (Kear 2005). It flies in dense flocks rather than in the defined V-formation typical of other goose species (Kear 2005), and arrives on its breeding grounds in small flocks of 3-15 individuals (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. It begins to breed in June in loose colonies, usually of around five to fifteen pairs (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, S. Rozenfeld<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, although up to 37 have been observed (Kear 2005).&#160;<p></p>","Deliberate hunting of birds occurs in Russia and Kazakhstan (Rozenfeld 2009, 2011b), and results from a recent tagging study suggest mortality owing to hunting could be very high - possibly up to 40% (N. Petkov <em>in litt</em>. 2015, 2016). Following land privatization, and especially the residential and tourist development boom in winter roosting and feeding areas, the quality of roosting areas has decreased. In addition, the low profitability of agriculture has reduced the area under winter wheat cultivation which, together with conversion to other crops, has decreased the availability of food. <a style=""mso-comment-reference:NP_1; mso-comment-date:20120503T1542"">Some key feeding sites have </a>been lost in Bulgaria<strong> </strong>(S.

Hulea <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Dereliev and Georgiev, 2002). Disturbance/chasing of feeding birds by hunters (because they associate with White-fronted Geese <em>Anser albifrons</em>, a legal quarry species) is a significant limitation on foraging behaviour and prenuptial accumulation of fat reserves, which has a negative effect on survival during spring migration and breeding (N. Petkov <em>in litt.</em> 2007, 2016). Hunting by tourists in Ukraine poses an increasing threat (WWT TWSG News 10 1997) and birds are shot at staging grounds in Russia.&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 67% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000). The increase in oil and gas operations in the region has seen a significant expansion into previously remote areas and has resulted in disturbance of breeding birds as well as direct habitat loss to a small degree. Further expansion of operations in the region is anticipated (Cranswick <em>et al. </em>2010). Other threats include industrial developments at breeding sites in Gydan and Yamal, the use of fungicides (Mateo <em>et al. </em>2016) and rodenticides in the wintering grounds, as well as displacement by windfarms in the wintering areas. A major recent threat is the expansion in windfarms in the wintering areas since 2008. Many thousands of wind turbines have been proposed in Dobrudhza area both in Bulgaria and Romania, including large complexes adjacent to IBAs and SPAs. Data analysis from wintering grounds in Bulgaria suggest that there is already impact of the constructed windfarms leading to displacement and shifting of the foraging areas (<a>Petkov <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012</a>).<br/><p></p></span></span>","Coordinated censuses in January 2003, 2004 and 2005 resulted in total population estimates of 33,600, 52,800 and 32,100 individuals respectively. The geometric mean of these totals 38,500. Recalculating this including the 2006 count of c.34,000 gives a revised geometric mean of 37,000 individuals. However, total counts of 40,800 in spring 2008 (primarily as a result of a large count in Kalmykia), 44,300 the following winter (Cranswick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and a potential population count of 56,860 in autumn 2010 (Rozenfeld 2011a) lend further weight to the suggestion that counts in the mid 2000s might be partially incomplete because birds wintered away from the traditionally surveyed sites. In 2015, Wetlands International increased its global population estimate from c. 44,000 to c. 56,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species breeds on the Taimyr (70% of the population), Gydan  and Yamal peninsulas, Russia (Hunter and Black 1996). In winter, prior  to the 1950s, much of the population occurred along the western coast of  the Caspian Sea, mainly in Azerbaijan, and in Iran and Iraq. The  wintering area then rapidly shifted to the western Black Sea coast, and  80-90% of birds now congregate in January/ February at 5-10 roost sites  on the Black Sea coast, particularly at Shabla Lakes and Durankulak  Lake, Bulgaria, Razelm-Sinoe lagoons, Romania, and in the coastal area  between the rivers Danube and Dniester in Ukraine (A. Mikityuk&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>1999,&#160;Rusev <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008,&#160;Cranswick&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010). Small numbers also  winter in Azerbaijan. The precise distribution in winter varies  according to the severity of the weather from the Crimean peninsula to  the Dobrudzha region of Bulgaria. In cold weather, small numbers are  occasionally on the Aegean shore of Greece and Turkey (Cranswick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.  </span>2010); during prolonged mild periods, significant numbers may remain in  Kalmykya, Stavropol and Rostov districts in Russia (S. Rozenfeld <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in  litt. </span>2012). Migration is believed to follow a relatively narrow route  south down the Ob to Kazakhstan (though a small number of ringing  recoveries and recent satellite tracking data point to some birds passing to the west of the Urals [Simeonov <em>et al. </em>2014]) and  then east to the Black Sea. There are four known main staging areas: the  Lower Ob, Middle Ob and Kumo-Manych depression in Russia, and the  Northern and Kostanay regions of Kazakhstan. They are also regularly  recorded in small numbers on passage in Hungary (e.g. Pigniczki 2008).  There may be other, currently unknown, staging sites (several new sites have been identified by satellite tracking [Simeonov <em>et al. </em>2014]) and knowledge of  the migration route, particularly in Siberia, should therefore be  considered incomplete. It is also possible that some wintering grounds  remain undetected (perhaps in eastern Ukraine and southwest Russia),&#160;and use of these areas during mild weather may account for the variation in winter survey totals in recent years.<br/><br/>Maximum population counts from wintering or staging areas were 60,000 between 1967-1970, 25,907 between 1976-1990, 75,879 between 1991-1995, 88,000 in 1996  (Aarvak <em>et al.</em> 1996), 60,444 between 1998-2001 (with a maximum of 88,425 in winter 2000) (D. Hulea <em>in litt</em>. 2003) and 56,860 in 2010 (Rozenfeld 2011a)<strong></strong>. It is unclear whether these represent genuine population fluctuations or are due to incomplete surveying of the species following suspected alteration its winter  distribution (as has been seen in the late 1960s following deterioration  of wintering conditions in Azerbaijan) with larger numbers of birds now  short-stopping and over-wintering in Ukraine (Rusev&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2008,&#160;Cranswick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and in areas in Romania (N.

An International Species Working Group (in 2010 it became an AEWA Single Species Working Group [N. Petkov <em>in litt. </em>2016]) is active and a coordinator is in place. From 2010 to 2015 an EU Life project ran in Bulgaria, which aimed to address many of the key threats operating on the wintering grounds (see Illiev and Petkov 2015). As part of this project a new mixed patrol scheme has been introduced around Shabla and Durankulak lakes SPAs by the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds/BirdLife Bulgaria (BSPB) that includes representatives of hunting control and conservation regional authorities and BSPB experts; and they control the legislation and restrictions enforcement in the SPAs territories (N.

It is therefore listed as Endangered. This species may warrant a downlisting in the future but this will depend on a robust understanding of the threats on the status of the breeding population.","It breeds below c.900 m in mountainous areas, along clear flowing rivers with tall riverine forest, mainly within the temperate conifer-broadleaf forest zone. It is largely confined to primary forests, with an abundance of potential nest-holes. During a study on the Russian breeding grounds, river size, mountain slope, human population, estimated forest cover and water clarity all failed to explain the observed distribution, but the species showed a marked preference for the middle reaches of rivers (Solovieva <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). On passage and in winter it feeds along large rivers and tracking of several birds over multiple years suggests winter site fidelity (Barter <em>et al. </em>2015). Flocks of up to 20 individuals have been noted on passage or in winter (Duckworth and Chol 2005). In Russia, they moult on a range of water bodies within the breeding range and north and east of breeding range, including rivers, estuaries and the sea&#160;but the stable isotope analysis confirmed that the species is predominately confined to freshwater habitat&#160;(Solovyeva&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2014b). A satellite tracking study of individuals breeding in the Lesser Xingan Mountains&#160;found migration to last on average 42 days, stopping at several sites on route. This study was however based on a very small sample size and so may not necessarily be representative of the population as a whole (Dong-Ping <em>et al.</em> 2014). &#160;<p></p>","In the 1960s and 1970s, its decline in Russia coincided with economic development of the taiga. Primary forests in the valleys of all large rivers were greatly altered, but large-scale deforestation in river valleys is now prohibited; however, the new Russian Forest Codex (2007) requires a water protection zone (no deforestation) of only 100 m for large rivers (50 m on each side), and 50 m (25 m each side) for rivers shorter that 100 km, which is likely to significantly reduce suitable breeding habitat for this species, which nests up to 150 m from rivers (D. Solovieva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008). Logging of river sources and adjacent slopes has led to reduced spring water levels and changes in fish abundance; since logging began on the Avvakumovka River in 2004, spring water levels and merganser populations have undergone continuous declines (D. Solovieva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008). Other major threats within the breeding range include illegal hunting (Solovyera 2013), drowning in fishing nets (a major cause of mortality at Russian breeding sites in 2003-2007 [D. Solovieva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008]), disturbance from motor boats during the breeding season, river pollution and natural predators. Increased hunting of waterfowl for sport together with poor regulation of the spring hunting season (which is intended to coincide with passage migration and avoid targeting locally breeding birds) is a significant and increasing threat; large numbers were reportedly shot in the Kievka River basin, southern Primorye, in spring 2008 (D. Solovieva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008). Threats in its breeding range in China include dam construction, deforestation, illegal hunting, human disturbance and the use of poisons and/or explosives for fishing (Peiqi Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. Fine-meshed nets were a significant threat to the post-breeding congregations at Song Jiang He in Jilin Province, China, but illegal fishing at the site has been reduced and only large-meshed nets are used in legal fish-farming (Peiqi Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. The site remains threatened by industrial pollution (Peiqi Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. The proposed Korean Grand Canal project, which aimed to canalise 3,134 km  of the Korean peninsula's rivers and radically alter the Han and  Nakdong rivers (which currently support an estimated 30-50 birds in  winter), was suspended in June 2008 (Moores  2008), and an alternative scheme, the Four Rivers Project, was proposed in December of that year, with an environmental impact assessment and launch of construction in 2009 (Moores <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010),&#160;despite environmental arguments against the project.&#160;In South Korea, the species is impacted by increased river turbidity due to construction and dredging, bridge-building activities, river-bank strengthening and road-widening schemes (Moores <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Some of these activities are associated with the Four Rivers Project on several stretches of river used regularly or irregularly by the species<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>. Other significant aspects of habitat modification will include the deepening of rivers and the removal of boulders and islands, which are used for roosting. Many stretches of river are expected to be rendered unusable for the species owing to habitat degradation and disturbance (Moores <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). The species has low genetic diversity (Solovyeva and Pearce 2011). High levels of heavy metals, especially As and Hg, were reported in females and their eggs after wintering in the Yangtze catchment (Solovyeva<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2012). Poor egg hatchability recorded within Sikhote-Alin population could be a result of pollution on the wintering grounds.<p></p>","In Russia, c.1,643 pairs nest in Sikhote-Alin (Solovyeva <em>et al. </em>2014), with just 11 pairs estimated to nest north of the Amur river. In China, 155 pairs breed in the Changbai Mountains &#160;and 11 pairs in Lesser Xingan&#160;(Solovyeva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). In North Korea, breeding occurs at&#160;Mayang Chosuji reservoir&#160;and&#160;116 pairs are estimated to breed in the Changbai Mountains&#160;(Chong and Morishita 1996,&#160;Solovyeva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;Pair densities were found to be highest on the Fuerhe River in the Chinese Changbai Mountains (0.918 pairs/km)&#160;and on the Pavlovka River in Sikhote-Alin (0.63 pairs/km) (Solovyeva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;The total world population is therefore estimated at 1,936 pairs (Solovyeva <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2014).

Some populations in its Iberian stronghold have been suggested to have stabilised and possibly increased, although there is now some evidence for at least local declines in some areas in this region. Additionally, hunting in Central and East Asia results in high rates of adult mortality, and land-use changes in eastern Europe, Russia, Central Asia and Morocco may have a significant impact on this species's population and the extent of its remaining habitat, such that it is likely to decline at a rapid rate over the next three generations. It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable.

Nest sites are selected in grassland, fallow or cereal fields (Rocha <em>et al. </em>2013) (primarily alfalfa in Central Europe and wheat in Russia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan [M.

The eastern subspecies nests in agricultural mosaics, open steppe, and adjacent to forest edge (Kessler 2015).

119333622,3897,Caretta caretta,Vulnerable,A2b,2017,2015-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em><strong>Rationale<br/></strong></em>The global population of the Loggerhead Turtle (<em>Caretta caretta</em>) comprises 10 subpopulations (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) that vary widely in population size, geographic range, and population trends, and are the appropriate units for assessment of global conservation status for this species (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). As such, assessments have been completed for each of the 10 subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). At the global level, both geographic distribution and population size are much larger than required to qualify for a threatened category. The available long-term series of nest counts (used as an index of population abundance) show an important decrease in the past (47%). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle is considered as Vulnerable under current IUCN Red List Criteria (criterion A2b). The previous listing, published in 1996, was Endangered under criterion A1bd (Marine Turtle Specialist Group 1996).<br/><br/>Results indicate that the Loggerhead Turtle, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation according to any Red List criteria. However, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Loggerhead Turtle population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by IUCN Red List Categories), but also in the criteria under which the individual subpopulations qualified for a threatened category (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). For these reasons, the subpopulation-level assessments for the Loggerhead Turtle should be given priority in evaluating the true global conservation status of this species. This conclusion follows the precedent for other long-lived, widely distributed species, including the Leatherback Turtle (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><em><strong>Justification<br/></strong></em>The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy exceeds the thresholds for criterion B, and the population size exceeds the thresholds for criteria C and D. Regarding criterion A, trends were estimated on time series datasets with ≥10 years of data of nesting activities (nest counts) at 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations out of 10 (North West Atlantic, Mediterranean, South West Atlantic, North West Indian, South West Indian, North Pacific). These six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current annual nests globally (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). The analysis revealed different trends for different subpopulations, with an overall -47% population decrease relative to population size three generations ago, which qualifies for the Vulnerable category (under criterion A2). The species trend at a global scale is basically determined by the two most abundant subpopulations, the North West Atlantic and the North West Indian, which altogether comprise about 75% of the current annual nests. They showed positive and negative trends, respectively. The other four subpopulations for which trends could be calculated show positive trends. For the remaining four subpopulations (comprising about 10% of the current annual nests; North East Atlantic, North East Indian, South East Indian, South Pacific), current trends are unclear, however past negative trends are known or suspected at least for the South Pacific and the North East Atlantic subpopulations respectively.<br/>&#160;<br/>The overall scenario suggests that, on the basis of the current knowledge, the extinction of the species at the global level is highly unlikely to occur in the short and medium term. However, the global status of the species in terms of distribution, number of subpopulations, genetic variability, regional ecological roles, and vulnerability, could change dramatically from the past and current situations. For this reason, the global assessment cannot be considered as an indicator of the true conservation status of the species, and priority should be given to the subpopulation assessments.<br/><br/><em><strong>Assessment Procedure:</strong></em><br/><u>Criterion A</u><br/>For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (National Research Council 2010).<br/><br/>To apply criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of the Loggerhead, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 45 years (see the Habitats and Ecology section below). For criterion A, data from three generations ago (~135 years) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e., assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtles—with generation lengths of 30 years or more—are obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for a review). Abundance data from ~135 years ago are not available for Loggerheads anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations ago (~135 years, one generation estimated 45 years; see Habitats and Ecology section below) was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation. A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another sea turtle species, the Leatherback Turtle (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013) and of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply criterion A we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations. For the Loggerhead global and subpopulation assessments we only considered time series datasets of ≥10 years.<br/><br/>For the global Loggerhead population, we considered time series datasets of 10-50 years, from 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations (see the individual subpopulation assessments). The index nesting sites included in the analysis are assumed to be representative of their subpopulations, and these six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current total annual nests (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>The assessment under criterion A was conducted in three steps, as follows. Please see the separate subpopulation assessments for further details.<br/><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> We estimated past trends for each of the six individual subpopulations. Specifically, from one past and one recent abundance values (each representing the annual average of five year nest counts) we calculated overall trends (past-present) for each index nesting sites within subpopulations, and then we calculated overall subpopulation past trends for each subpopulation (criteria A1-A2).</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The past and present total abundance values of the six subpopulations (obtained from Step 2) were summed and from these totals the overall population change (past-present) was calculated (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material). </li></ul>Five of the above six subpopulations showed positive trends and one showed a negative trend. Altogether, they showed a negative trend (-47%). The overall negative trend depended on the negative trend of one subpopulation (North West Indian) where criterion A2 was appropriate – i.e. the causes of reduction may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible. Therefore, the overall trend of the six subpopulations was assessed against criterion A2. The past estimated trend was above the threshold for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 (30% decline) but below the threshold for the Endangered category (50% decline). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle qualifies for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 and the applicable subcriterion is (b), an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (counts of nests or tracks).<br/><br/>Although these trends consider only 6 of 10 subpopulations, these subpopulations with sufficient available data account for about 90% of the current global population abundance (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, these trends likely reflect the complete global trend and represent the best information available about the global population trend. Similarly, the global Leatherback Turtle assessment used only five of seven subpopulations to estimate global trends due to lack of sufficient data for two subpopulations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><u>Criterion B</u><br/>Since the population area extends over entire oceans around the world, the extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the threatened category threshold (20,000 km²). The area of occupancy (AOO) for sea turtles is identified with the nesting beach habitat, which represents the smallest habitat for a critic life stage. Since the appropriate scale for AOO is a grid 2x2 km, the threshold of 2,000 km² corresponds to 1,000 km of linear coastal tract, which is easily exceeded (by orders of magnitude) by the total length of nesting beaches globally. In conclusion, the global population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion B.<br/><br/><u>Criterion C</u><br/>To apply criterion C, the number of adults is needed and can be derived from the number of nests per year with the following formula:&#160; Adults = Nests * Nests per female<sup>-1</sup> * Remigration interval * Female proportion<sup>-1</sup>. With a current estimate of annual number of nests of about 200,000, for any reasonable value of the other parameters the population would easily exceed the threshold of 10,000 adults required to qualify for a threatened category under criterion C.<br/><br/><u>Criterion D</u><br/>The number of mature individuals (see criterion C) and AOO value (see criterion B) exceeded the respective thresholds. In conclusion, the population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion D.<br/><br/><u>Criterion E</u><br/>Although population viability analyses (PVA) were attempted at subpopulation level (Conant <em>et al</em>. 2009, Van Houtan 2011), in most cases they were not suitable for criterion E under this assessment. No PVA has been attempted at species level and such an approach would also be questionable because the subpopulations are independent units by definition.<br/><br/><strong><em>Sources of Uncertainty</em></strong><br/>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (National Research Council 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (National Research Council 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Loggerheads, including age at maturity, generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, remigration intervals, etc.). These values can vary within and among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends. However, we have reduced this source of uncertainty by using in the analyses those data sets obtained though standardized monitoring.<br/><br/>For the trend analyses (criterion A) we used data from index rookeries from six populations out of 10. Possible negative past trends associated to high past abundances in the other four subpopulations not included in the analysis could have changed the final result of the assessment (past trends, criterion A2), if such information was available.<br/><br/>For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).","The Loggerhead Turtle nests on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the temperate and subtropical regions worldwide. Like most sea turtles, Loggerhead Turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (Bolten and Witherington 2003). Upon leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Bolten and Witherington 2003, Putman and Mansfield 2015). After 4-19 years in the oceanic zone, Loggerheads recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in benthic prey or epipelagic prey where they forage and grow until maturity at 10–39 years (Avens and Snover 2013). Upon attaining sexual maturity Loggerhead Turtles undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas at remigration intervals of one to several years with a mean of 2.5–3 years for females (Schroeder <em>et al</em>. 2003) while males would have a shorter remigration interval (e.g., Hays <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wibbels <em>et al</em>. 1990). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Plotkin 2003). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (Bolten and Witherington 2003).<br/><br/><strong><em>Generation length</em></strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population (i.e., older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual) and care should be taken to avoid underestimation (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Although different subpopulations may have different generation length, since this information is limited we adopted the same value for all the subpopulations, taking care to avoid underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).<br/><br/>Loggerheads attain maturity at 10-39 years (Avens and Snover 2013), and we considered here 30 years to be equal or greater than the average age at maturity. Data on reproductive longevity in Loggerheads are limited, but are becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches. Tagging studies have documented reproductive histories up to 28 years in the North Western Atlantic Ocean (Mote Marine Laboratory, unpubl. data), up to 18 years in the South Western Indian Ocean (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013), up to 32 years in the South Western Atlantic Ocean (Projeto Tamar unpubl. data), and up to 37 years in the South Western Pacific Ocean, where females nesting for 20-25 years are common (C. Limpus, pers. comm). We considered 15 years to be equal or greater than the average reproductive longevity. Therefore, we considered here 45 years to be equal or greater than the average generation length, therefore avoiding underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).","Threats to Loggerheads vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Loggerheads, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011) as:<br/><ol><li>Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;</li><li>Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e., consumption, commercial products);</li><li>Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc;</li><li>Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e., through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (for example fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;</li><li>Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).</li><li>The relative impacts of individual threats to all Loggerhead subpopulations were assessed by by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Loggerheads globally, followed by coastal development and human consumption of eggs, meat, or other products. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Loggerheads—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts. </li></ol>More detailed information at regional level can found in the specific subpopulation assessments.","Loggerheads are a single species globally comprising 10 biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) – hereafter subpopulations - which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. Regional management units are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are 10 Loggerhead subpopulations: NorthWest Atlantic Ocean, North East Atlantic Ocean, South West Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North East Indian Ocean, North West Indian Ocean, South East Indian Ocean, South West Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010)  (shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).<br/><br/>Total population size is unknown. The most common proxy for population abundance in sea turtles is the annual number of nests. A total of about 200,000 clutches are laid annually by the 10 subpopulations altogether (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Considering a range of 3 to 5.5 clutches per female, the above value would correspond to approximately 36,000-67,000 nesting females annually.",Decreasing,"The Loggerhead Turtle is globally distributed throughout the subtropical and temperate regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).","Loggerhead Turtles and their eggs are taken for human use (i.e., consumption and commercial products).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Loggerhead Turtles are afforded legislative protection under a number of treaties and laws (Wold 2002). Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). A partial list of the International Instruments that benefit Loggerhead Turtles includes the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA), the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection, the Memorandum of Agreement on the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.<br/><br/>As a result of these designations and agreements, many of the intentional impacts directed at sea turtles have been lessened: harvest of eggs and adults has been slowed at several nesting areas through nesting beach conservation efforts and an increasing number of community-based initiatives are in place to slow the take of turtles in foraging areas. In regard to incidental take, the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices has proved to be beneficial in some areas, primarily in the United States and South and Central America (National Research Council 1990). Guidelines are available to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations in coastal and high seas fisheries (FAO 2009). However, despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world. In most areas, the lack of effective monitoring in pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the supporting ecosystems of long-lived Loggerhead Turtles.<br/><br/>More detailed information at regional level can be found in the specific subpopulation assessments.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Breeding success is low. It is mainly a crepuscular feeder and utilises intertidal mudflats (Yu and Swennen 2004b)<strong></strong>; resting, sleeping and digesting occur at a variety of sites (trees, man-made structures, shallow water) within 2-3 km of feeding areas (Yu and Swennen 2004a)<strong></strong>. Spoonbills employ tactile feeding using lateral sweeps of the bill to locate fish and shrimp prey (Swennen and Yu 2005)<strong></strong>. Satellite tracking has shown that birds wintering in Hong Kong and Taiwan migrate along the coast of eastern China to northern Jiangsu, then over the Yellow Sea to the Korean peninsula. Wintering birds form large aggregations and it has been recorded amongst flocks of Eurasian Spoonbills <em>Platalea leucorodia </em>(Yu and Swennen 2005)<strong></strong>. Occasionally Black-faced Spoonbills also use freshwater habitats (Yu and Swennen 2005, Wood <em>et al. </em>2013).

However, habitat destruction is probably the biggest threat currently. The breeding range of this species lies almost entirely in the Yellow Sea area where the intertidal mudflat has been reclaimed in an alarmingly fast rate (Yat-tung Yu&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;The main wintering grounds are threatened by industrial development, particularly a key site in Taiwan and also in China, and reclamation, especially in South Korea, Japan and China. Economic development in China has converted many coastal wetlands into aquaculture ponds and industrial estates. Pollution remains a major threat to birds wintering in Hong Kong. An outbreak of botulism at one of the major wintering sites killed 73 birds representing 7% of the world population from December 2002 to February 2003 (M. C. Coulter <em>in litt. </em>2003<strong><sup> </sup></strong>, Yu 2003), and isolated cases of botulism still happen every winter to kill several individuals at both Taiwan and Hong Kong (Yat-tung Yu <em>in litt. </em>2016).

The population has been inferred to have historically numbered c.10,300 individuals (Yeung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, which fell to an estimated low of 288 individuals in 1988. Regular monitoring via the International Black-faced Spoonbill Census has indicated a recovery. 1,069 individuals were counted during the 2003 census, 2,065 individuals in 2008 and 3,272 individuals in 2015 (Yu <em>et al. </em>2015) representing a steady increase on previous totals that may reflect genuine increases and result from successful conservation measures at a number of sites&#160;<strong></strong>(Yu 2008, Chan&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Some uncertainty remains over whether census increases represent increased survey effort, displacement of birds from unknown wintering sites or genuine population increases, thus on the basis of on-going habitat loss and degradation the overall population may decline in the near future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Taiwan is still the largest wintering area for the species, where there  were a total of 2,060 individuals (a marginal increase of 26 birds). The  increase in the total global population was mainly a result of more  records from mainland China, which had a 32% increase from 330  individuals in 2015 to 434 in 2016. Increases were also recorded in  South Korea, Japan and Macau. Worryingly, however, the figure from Deep  Bay (Hong Kong, and Shenzhen, China) decreased from 462 individuals in  2010 to 371 individuals this year, which represents a cumulative  decrease of nearly 20% over the period (including 40 fewer individuals  than 2015).",Increasing,"<em>Platalea minor</em> breeds on islets off the west coast of <strong>North Korea</strong> and <strong>South Korea</strong>, and offshore islets in Liaoning province in mainland NE <strong>China </strong>(Birdlife International 2001).

It breeds at a small number of wetland locations in arid regions which are vulnerable to human disturbance and strongly influenced by changes in climate, and it now appears that the vast majority of birds are dependent on intertidal habitats in the Bohai Bay during the non-breeding season. The severe and increasing threat of reclamation of these &#160;coastal wetlands for development is likely to be the primary driver of future declines.<p></p>","All known breeding colonies are below 1,500 m, in the arid-steppe zone, on islands in saline and slightly saline lakes with fluctuating water-levels. No nesting occurs if lakes dry up, if the islands become joined to the shore, or if the water-level is too high and the islands become too small or overgrown with vegetation.&#160;<br/>In the non-breeding season&#160;foraging Relict Gulls are near-confined to tidal flats with firmer sandy substrates and patches of silt or mud (typically the outer parts of estuaries) which support a high concentration of shellfish, with only a few individuals (mostly first-winters) also found on sandy beaches in bays and close to river mouths (N. Moores <em>in litt</em>. 2017).","Changes in water-level affect breeding success, and the loss of ephemeral wetland habitats in arid regions, associated with climate change, could greatly affect this species in the near future (He Fenqi <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>, although geographic shifts and fluctuations could result, rather than chronic declines. Climate models used to predict scenarios until 2080 suggest a trend of increasing aridisation of current steppe areas in Kazakhstan and an overall shift of vegetation zones into Siberia (Tchebakova<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2009), probably resulting in the drying-out of shallow saline lakes used for nesting in north-eastern Kazakhstan, although many lakes in southern Siberia would be expected to become more saline owing to these climatic changes, providing replacement habitat for this mobile species (J. Kamp <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The former breeding site of Lake Balkhash is unlikely to be recolonised if the drying trend there continues (J. Kamp <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The major breeding colony at Taolimiao-Alashan Nur, China, has been affected by recent tourist developments, and habitat degradation since 2002, caused by  drought, human disturbance and unsustainable water use, has resulted in  the absence of nesting activity by this species since 2006 (He Fenqi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). For similar reasons Hongjian Nur in the Ordos uplands has decreased from an area of over 60 km<sup>2</sup> to c.40 km<sup>2</sup>, with an increased pH value of up to 9.6, thus threatening the colony there (He Fenqi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>.  2011), with a further decrease to c.32.8 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>and a pH value of 9.8 recorded in 2016 (Anon 2016). Competition for breeding sites and predation by other gulls, as well as mortality from hailstorms and flooding, can affect breeding productivity. Human disturbance has caused increased mortality of eggs and chicks in Russia and China, by making them vulnerable to bad weather, predation and desertion.&#160;<br/>In South Korea, most of the mudflats at the Nakdong estuary have been reclaimed and it is likely that many other coastal wetlands are under similar pressure from development. The major wintering area at Bohai Bay, China, has been affected by reclamation for oilfields, harbours, roads and other developments, and plans are in hand to reclaim 43% of the remaining habitat (Yang Liu <em>et al</em>. 2006). In addition, the Bohai Sea is amongst the world's most polluted, and expansion of offshore oil extraction in Bohai Bay will increase the likelihood of spills, such as those that occurred from the Penglai offshore oilfield in June 2011 (P. Holt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011)<strong></strong>. Other coastal wintering areas are under threat from development, as  demonstrated by a massive reclamation project in Tianjin, resulting in  the displacement of the wintering population northwards to the  Nanpu-Caofedian area of coastal Tangshan, Hebei, which is in turn  threatened by another reclamation project (P. Holt<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2011). Another threat in coastal wintering areas of that of disturbance caused by increasingly mechanised shellfish harvesting (P. Holt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). The site in Tianjin where a single flock of 10,405 (the majority of the world population) were counted in March 2015 is said to be threatened with imminent reclamation (Townshend 2015).","The population was estimated at 12,000 individuals by Rose and Scott (1997); however, over 7,000 nests were recorded in 2010 and 2011 in the Ordos uplands of western Inner Mongolia and northern China (He Fenqi <em>in litt.</em> 2011), strongly suggesting that the total number of mature individuals exceeds the previous estimate. The population is thus placed in the band for 10,000-19,999 mature individuals, equating to 15,000-29,999 individuals in total, rounded here to 15,000-30,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Larus relictus</em> breeds at two localities in eastern <strong>Kazakhstan </strong>(but regularly at only one [Rubini and Berezovikov 2002])<strong></strong>, one in <strong>Russia</strong> and several in <strong>Mongolia, </strong>whilst the largest colonies are thought to occur in <strong>China</strong>, at Honjian Nur Lake, Shaanxi (up to 5,000 pairs [He Fenqi and Ren Yong-qui 2006]) and previously at Taolimiao-Alashan Nur on the Ordos Plateau in Inner Mongolia (up to 3,000 pairs [He Fenqi and Qiao Zhenzhong <em>in litt.</em> 2004]<strong></strong>), although this site was recently abandoned (He Fenqi and Ren Yong-qui 2006)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>Its non-breeding range is poorly understood, but some are known to winter in <strong>South Korea</strong>, whist large numbers (7,880 near Tanggu, coastal Tianjin [P.

It is now considered far more likely that the species is entirely restricted to intertidal coastal areas in the non-breeding season (N. Moores <em>in litt.</em> 2017).

However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the world’s most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 km²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 km²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5‒15 bears per 1,000 km²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, Frković <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130–220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 km² and 2,200 km² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21‒29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of Gärdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (≈1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The Black-bellied Pangolin also meets criteria A4cd using a period of 21 years (14 years past, 7 years future) because it is inferred that suitable habitat has been lost in the last 14 years, and will continue to be so, while populations have been and are expected to continue to be hunted (and it is suspected much hunting is unsustainable), resulting in declines of 30-40%. Anthropogenic activities, such as mining and logging, may also exacerbate the situation as they increase accessibility to previously inaccessible areas for hunting and poaching.</p><p>  </p><p>For both threats, the risk and rate of loss is likely different between West and Central Africa, noting that higher levels of habitat loss and human population growth in West Africa has resulted not only in proportionally higher rates of decline in this region (likely &gt; 50%), but also proportionally greater losses into the future. West Africa has deforestation rates that are three times higher than in the Congo basin forests, has higher human population densities, and smaller patches of roadless areas. In the future, differing regional assessments may be necessary to more accurately reflect the status of Black-bellied Pangolin populations. </p><p>  </p><p>A generation length of 7 years has been used for this assessment. This is based on inferences of age at first reproduction in the wild in Asian pangolins of about 2 years, and an assumption of a 10-year reproductive period (2 + [0.5*10]). However, it should be noted that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this estimate and further research into the life history of the Black-bellied Pangolin is needed to make a more informed estimate of generation length.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>Specific studies documenting habitat use by Black-bellied Pangolins are limited. This species is the most arboreal of the African pangolin species. They are often found in riparian and swamp forests, typically in habitats dominated by palms (including rattans) and specialized swamp trees, such as <em>Uapaca </em>spp., <em>Pseudospondis </em>spp.<em> </em>and <em>Mitragina </em>spp<em>.</em> (Gaubert 2011, Happold 1987, Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013), as well as in primary forests and forest-savannah mosaic. In the more northern parts of their distribution, they occur in dry Guinean forests lacking palms and in the forest regions of Côte d’Ivoire and Nigeria this species has been recorded in degraded forest habitats, farmlands, and plantations (Angelici <em>et al</em>. 1999, Luiselli <em>et al</em>.<em></em> 2015, Sodeinde and Adedipe 1994). This suggests some flexibility in habitat requirements, although it remains unknown if Black-bellied Pangolins can breed in these transformed habitats or whether they act as population sinks.</p>  <p>Individuals sleep in tree hollows or hollowed-out insect nests, and feed on ants and termites that live in tree tops above the flood-line. The gestation period is about 140 days, after which the female gives birth to a single young. Breeding is believed to be aseasonal and almost continuous (Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013).</p><p><br/></p>","<p></p><p>This species is threatened by hunting for the local, and increasingly international, traditional medicine and bushmeat markets. Ingram <em>et al.</em> (2018) estimate that 0.4–2.7 million pangolins are hunted each year in Central African forests and that this number has increased by 150% over the past four decades. Although no formal evaluation has yet to be made, the majority of these are believed to be White-bellied Pangolins (<em>P. tricuspis</em>). The 2.3-fold increase in the price of <em>Phataginus spp.</em> between 1990 and 2015 across urban markets in Central and West Africa (Ingram <em>et al. </em>2018) may indicate an increase in demand and/or that arboreal species have become harder to obtain.</p>  <p>The species has been reported in international trade (Bräutigam&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1994, Chaber <em>et al. </em>2010, Mwale <em>et al.</em> 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017, Ingram <em>et al</em>. 2019). According to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) trade reports for the period 1996–2011, trade in live animals, specimens or skins is reported in nearly every year, with 40 specimens exported from the Central African Republic in 2000 (<u><a href=""http://www.cites.org/"">www.cites.org</a></u>).&#160;As with other African pangolin species, exploitation of black-bellied pangolins for Asian markets is believed to be increasing (Challender and Waterman 2017). The species is included in international trafficking to Asian markets: it is estimated that between 2015 and 2019 &gt;400,000 African pangolins were seized either in Africa bound for Asia, or in Asia (Challender<em> et al.</em> 2019; D. Challender, unpubl. data).&#160;</p>  <p><em></em>Hunters in Gabon report that Asian industry workers requested meat from all three pangolin species in Gabon (including <span class=""msoIns"">Black-bellied Pangolins). Pangolins were sought after more than any other species (Mambeya <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is also a threat. Past and present declines in pangolin area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality likely differ between West and Central Africa. West Africa had deforestation rates of 0.9% between 1990 and 2000 and 0.3% between 2000 and 2010 (Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013). In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, and Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> in terms of their percent increase in loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (of countries with &gt;100,000 ha of primary forest; World Resources Institute 2019). West Africa also presently has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch <em>et al. </em>2016). Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux <em>et al</em>. 2013), however true rates of decline are imperfectly known. Evidence of a general drying trend, particularly in the upper Congolese forests (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 2014), may exacerbate the situation through possible changes in vegetation species composition and structure that may result in decreased habitat suitability for Black-bellied Pangolins.</p>","<p>There are no formal quantitative data available on densities or abundance. This is the least frequently recorded of all the African pangolin species, possibly reflecting its occurrence in little-penetrated habitats and/or reflecting its rare nature and low densities. Preliminary research on the ecology of this species in Côte d’Ivoire suggests a density of ~0.015 individuals/ha in a swamp forest habitat with a low, but constant, level of subsistence hunting pressure, with capture rates in more access-restricted sections suggesting that they may occur at higher densities ( ~0.26 individuals/ha; M. Shirley and B.G.-M. Assovi, unpubl. data).</p>  <p>The occurrence of Black-bellied Pangolins in hunters catch records, and bushmeat and traditional medicine markets has been used as an indicator of occurrence in some of the range countries (e.g., Ghana; Boakye <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, presence in markets may not be a good indicator of status in the wild, even in proximal natural habitats (e.g. Akani <em>et al</em>. 2015). In a survey of 200 local hunters, wildlife vendors, and community leaders in Lagos, Nigeria, Akeredolu <em>et al. </em>(2018) found that 70% believe wild pangolin populations to be declining but did not distinguish between species.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>  </p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in the forested regions of West and Central Africa from Sierra Leone eastwards through south-eastern Guinea (Barrie and Kanté 2006), Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and southwest Ghana (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998), after which there is an apparent gap in distribution until west Nigeria. Its presence in Nigeria is probably underestimated because of possible confusion with the white-bellied pangolin (<em>Phataginus tricuspis</em>) (Angelici <em>et al.</em> 1999, Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013). The species then occurs eastwards through southern Cameroon, and much of the Congo Basin forest block with the limits being south-western Central African Republic in the north, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the southern limits in Gabon and Republic of Congo. It is also suspected to occur in the Semuliki National Park in western Uganda; Kityo <em>et al</em>. 2016), and possibly in Cabinda, Angola (Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013, Gudehus <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;</p><p><br/></p><p></p>","<p>This species is hunted for its meat which ranks highly in wild meat preference studies - many of which group the species with the White-bellied Pangolin (e.g., Anadu <em>et al.</em> 1988). The meat is also found in wild meat (bushmeat) markets (e.g. Akani<em> et al</em>. 2015, Ingram<em> et al.</em> 2018). Various body parts of pangolins are also used for cultural and ethno-medicinal purposes, including in traditional African medicine (<em>muti </em>or <em>juju;</em> Bräutigam <em>et al.&#160;</em>1994; Angelici <em>et al</em>. 1999; Boakye <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Across all pangolin species that occur in Ghana and Sierra Leone, Boakye <em>et al.</em> (2014, 2015) identified 13 pangolin body parts that were used to treat health problems in Ghana and 22 pangolin body parts that were used to treat 59 different health problems in Sierra Leone. Boakye <em>et al</em>. (2016) interviewed traders in Ghana and found that out of 341 pangolins (carcasses and live animals) traded by farmer-hunters, chopbar operators, and wholesalers between September 2013 and January 2014, 18% were Black-bellied Pangolins. Of the 98 pangolins physically observed, 18% were Black-bellied Pangolins, and 82% were White-bellied Pangolins (<em>P. tricuspis</em>). Quantities hunted or sold at markets are difficult to determine as many studies group White-bellied and Black-bellied Pangolins together (Ingram <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>The scales of African pangolins are also increasingly trafficked internationally, primarily to Asian markets, based on seizure data (Challender and Waterman 2017, Ingram <em>et al.</em> 2019). To date, a single effort has evaluated the proportion of trafficked scales from different species - finding that, out of 2.01 tons of classifiable scales confiscated in Côte d’Ivoire (original seizures of 3.6 tonnes), only 11% were attributable to Black-bellied Pangolins (M.H.

It is unclear whether this will remain consistent from seizure to seizure.</p><p>Increasing trafficking of African pangolin scales to Asia is suspected to be driven by declines in Asian pangolins and increasing numbers of African countries are being implicated in international pangolin trafficking (Heinrich <em>et al. </em>2016, 2017). Several large shipments of scales seized in Asia in recent years have originated from Africa (Challender and Waterman 2017; Ingram et al. 2019), for example three shipments totalling 12.3 tonnes in Hong Kong SAR and China from Nigeria (2015-2017), four tonnes in Hong Kong SAR from Cameroon in 2016, three tonnes in Hong Kong SAR from Uganda in 2014 and 712 kg in Malaysia from Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Challender and Waterman 2017). Of all large-quantity pangolin scale shipments (weighing 1,000 kg or more) between 2010–2015, 55% were found to originate in Africa. Large-quantity shipments accounted for 60% of all scales traded. These significant shipments increased in frequency and weight through time (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017). Recent large seizures include 3 tonnes of scales in a single batch in Côte d’Ivoire in 2016 (Ingram <em>et al</em>. 2019), and two seizures of over 12 tonnes in Singapore in 2019, from Nigeria, <em>en route</em> to Vietnam (Liu 2019).</p><p>In addition, four Black-bellied Pangolin skulls and 10 skeletons were imported to the USA from Cameroon between 1999 and 2017 (Challender and Waterman 2017). In June 2008, five Black-bellied Pangolin specimens originating from the Central African Republic were seized in Paris (Chaber <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;Legal imports of this species totalled 248 live animals between 1990 and 2015, the majority of which are accounted for in a reported import of 200 individuals to China from Nigeria in 2015 for captive-breeding purposes. There are distinct differences in the numbers of reported imports and exports; for the same period (1990–2015) only 87 Black-bellied Pangolins were recorded to have been exported (Challender and Waterman 2017).&#160;</p><p></p>",Terrestrial,"<p></p><p>Black-bellied Pangolins are present in a number of protected areas (see below), and are likely present in most protected areas with suitable habitat.&#160;The species is found in a number of protected areas, including Ituri Forest Reserve, DRC, Dzanga-Sangha National Park, Central African Republic, Comoe National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, and potentially Semuliki National Park, Uganda but this requires verification. The species is protected by national legislation in most range states; in Gabon and Sierra Leone it is legal to hunt and trade both <em>Phataginus sp. </em>within defined seasons and under certain other criteria, none of which are virtually ever met by local hunters. While the species is included in CITES Appendix I, there is a need to enforce protective legislation in most range states, including raising awareness of the plight of this species amongst national authorities and border control agents.&#160;Research into the population status and trends of this little-known species and an assessment of its ability to withstand both current levels of hunting pressure and habitat modification are needed.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Smaller populations from southern Africa may be increasing. The status of populations in Central and West Africa, where the species is still known from very few specimens, remains unclear. Almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A2c.","Animals have been recorded from a wide variety of habitats ranging from savanna to montane tropical moist forest. In southern Africa the species frequents urban and suburban areas, foraging in areas of intensive agricultural operations (Fenton <em>et al</em>. 2002). Southern Africa colonies tend to be small (numbering up to 30 animals) and are regularly recorded from buildings (see Fenton <em>et al</em>. 2002). Other populations mainly roost in caves, disused tunnels, trees, hollows and on vegetation.","The leading threat to this species appears to be roost disturbance. Populations in Durban (South Africa) have been found to use old buildings with attics as roosts, and it appears that the main threat to these populations is indirect poisoning through the application of toxic timber treatments (Fenton <em>et al</em>. 2002).","Although this bat was once considered to be rare, with gaps in its distribution, additional collecting has demonstrated local abundance in several areas (Long 1995, Taylor 1998, Fenton <em>et al.</em> 2002, Skinner and Chimimba 2005).

123791436,15953,Panthera onca,Near Threatened,A2cd,2017,2016-08-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Classify as Near Threatened, due to a suspected 20-25% decline over the past three generations (21 years) in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and habitat quality, along with actual or potential levels of exploitation. Given the inherent difficulty of assessing this species, the normally low density with which it occupies the landscape and the effects that small population and habitat degradations can have on the species, our minimum assessment of population decrease could be a significant underestimate.<br/><br/>Since the previous Red List assessment in 2008, the threats to Jaguars have continued or intensified. The first expert mapping of Jaguar range took place in 2002 (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002), and the resulting map was used for the 2008 Red List assessment. Today, more is known about Jaguar distribution and abundance, allowing us to retrospectively classify areas as Jaguar range in 2015 that were previously identified as non-range or gaps in knowledge (Supplementary Material Figure 1). The 2015 mapping exercise also reflects updates to range recommended by Jaguar experts, with sufficient evidence (i.e., tracks, camera-trap photos, sightings of live or dead animals) to warrant inclusion/exclusion of range. The updated range indicates increasing fragmentation of Jaguar populations, particularly in eastern and southeastern Brazil, northern Venezuela and the Maya Forest (Selva Maya) of Mexico and Guatemala. Comparing 2015 Jaguar range to the extent of “known” range from the 2002 exercise, thereby controlling for the difference in knowledge extent, there is a 20.0% decline in Jaguar range over the past fourteen years (2002-2015), from 8.77 million km² to 7.02 million km² (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). With a more robust range map from which to begin the next assessment, the species will likely qualify for VU in the near future.<br/><br/>With a generation length of 6.84 years, we suspect at least a 20-25% loss in mature individuals over the past 21 years (three generations) because there are documented population declines together with habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Paviolo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Jedrzejewski <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales (de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2017a, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","The Jaguar has a stocky, heavy body with short massive limbs associated with reduced cursorial behaviour and dense forest habitat, and robust canines and large head allowing a more powerful bite than other large cats (Seymour 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Mean body weight varies by up to 100% across their range, those living further from the equator tend to be larger (Iriarte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1990). This extreme variation in size may reflect variation in the availability of large prey in different habitats: the largest Jaguars occur in open flood plains areas, the Llanos in Venezuela and the Pantanal in Brazil, and take the largest prey, and the smallest Jaguars inhabit the dense forest areas of Central America and Amazonia and take smaller prey (Hoogesteijn and Mondolfi 1996, Oliveira 2002).<br/><strong><br/><u>Habitat</u></strong><br/>Jaguar habitat is typically characterized by dense forest cover (mainly primary and secondary forest), the presence of water bodies and a sufficient prey base (Swank and Teer 1989, Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). However, they are found in range of habitats from rainforest to seasonally flooded swamp areas, pampas grassland, thorn scrub woodland, and dry deciduous forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars mainly inhabit tropical lowland forest, followed by dry tropical forest, xeric habitats and finally arable lowland pastures (Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Although Jaguars have been reported from elevations as high as 3000 m (Brown and Lopez Gonzalez 2001), they typically avoid montane forest, and have not been found in the high plateau of central Mexico or above 2700 m in the Andes (Ceballos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>, 2011). The species is more strongly associated with water in comparison to any of the other Panthera cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), indicated by their higher densities within tropical moist forests than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest (Maffei <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Even within drier areas they are only found around the main water courses. This characteristic quickly brings them into conflict with expansion of high intensity agriculture, having the same requirements of nearby water sources for irrigation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Home range</strong></u><br/>Jaguar home ranges vary in size across their geographic range, often according to the season and availability of resources (e.g. Crawshaw and Quigley 1991, Núñez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). Generally males range further than females.<br/><br/>In the dry tropical deciduous forest of Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, female home range size ranged from 25 km² (dry season) to 60 km² (wet season) (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Nunez et al 2002). In the semi-deciduous and seasonally flooded forest of Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, male home range size ranged from 33 to 41 km² for males and 32 to 59 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>In the tropical broadleaf moist lowland secondary forest of Belize, male home range size ranged from 28 to 40 km² (radio telemetry; Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). In the mosaic landscape (secondary broadleaf forest, savannah and agriculture) of Central Belize, male home ranges ranged from 103 to 194 km² in the dry season and 179 to 386 in the wet season, and from 86 to 99 km² for a single female in the dry and wet seasons respectively (95% MCP, GPS collars, Figueroa 2013).<br/><br/>In the llanos of Venezuela, home range size ranged from 93 to 100 km² (males, dry season) and ranged from 51 to 80 km² for females in the wet season and dry season respectively (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Scognamillo <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>There are numerous studies of home ranges from the seasonally inundated landscape of the Brazilian Pantanal: females 25 to 38 km² (radio telemetry; Schaller and Crawshaw 1980), females 5km² and males 20 km² for males in the wet season, and 70 and 79km², respectively, in the dry season (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw and Quigley 1991), female 38km² and male 67km² (95% fixed kernel, radio telemetry; Azevedo and Murray 2007), 57 to 176 km² (95% MCP, GPS collars; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006), and females 34 to 101 km² in the wet season, and 42 to 89 km² in the dry season, and males 79 to 149 km² in the wet season, and 58 to 263 km² in the dry season (90% adaptive kernel estimator, GPS collars, Cavalcanti and Gese (2009).<br/><br/>In the semi-deciduous rainforest of the Brazilian Atlantic forests, male home range size ranged from 87 to 139 km², and from 44 to 133 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Cullen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). It can be seen in the above review that the more recent studies using GPS technology show considerably larger range sizes compared to older VHF studies, this is especially indicative for recent GPS studies from areas where previously VHF studies were carried out. The differences are ranging from ~4-6 times larger. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these older ranges are considerably underrepresenting Jaguar home ranges. Densities based on these ranges are therefore equally overestimated.<br/><strong><br/><u>Diet</u></strong><br/>Jaguars are opportunistic hunters. Over 85 prey species (wild and livestock/domestic), including mammals, reptiles and birds, have been recorded in their diet across their geographic range (Seymour 1989).<br/><br/>Jaguars take a wide variety of prey species but large-sized ungulates are preferred when available (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The intake of large prey likely helps Jaguars save energy, since it is estimated that 50% of kills are larger prey on which they will feed for up to 4 days (Schaller and Crawshaw 1980, Nunez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Nevertheless, Jaguar diet is highly variable, depending on prey availability, ease of capture, and a variety of additional factors (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Seymour 1989). In some areas cattle (<em>Bos</em> sp.) comprise an important item in their diet (Polisar <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Palmeira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Cavalcanti and Gese 2010). The decline of wild prey below a minimum threshold increases livestock depredation by big cats (Khorozyan <em>et al</em>. 2015), which in turn may lead to retaliatory killings of felids by livestock owners. High frequency of smaller prey species is frequently reported in Jaguar diet, e.g. armadillo (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Novack <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Foster <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b). The species has therefore gained a reputation of being able to persist in relatively disturbed areas with incomplete prey assemblages (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). However, most diet studies rely on scat analysis. Palomares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) showed that the high majority of these scats are from males. Diet studies are therefore highly biased towards male diets. As males do not contribute anything to the rearing of young, as single individuals, they are able to sustain themselves better at a varied diet of small species. Mothers with cubs will likely require the larger ungulates but this important component of the populations is extremely poorly represented in diet studies of scats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Reproduction</strong></u><br/>There are few studies on the reproductive ecology of Jaguars in the wild. Males and females may come together for breeding opportunities at any time of the year (e.g. Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). The female is in oestrus 6-17 day period, and gestation lasts 91-101 days (in captivity), after which the female gives birth to up to four cubs, usually two, which will stay with her for up to 24 months (Mondolfi and Hoogesijn 1982, Seymour 1989, Kitchener 1991, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cubs are fully dependent on their mother’s milk for the first 10-11 weeks, and continue to suckle until 5-6 months old (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cycling could resume 2-3 weeks following lactational anestrus (Soares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). However, inter-birth intervals documented in the wild are approximately two years (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Carrillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). By 15-18 months, Jaguars travel and hunt independently within their mother’s range, although they may still come together at kill sites (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars are usually independent by the age of 24 months, however the age of dispersal or the social circumstances associated with it are poorly known (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Dispersal does not appear to be linked with the onset of sexual maturity, estimated at 24-30 months for females and 36-48 months for males (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Few data are available on dispersal distances however telemetry studies in the Brazilian Pantanal suggest that males disperse further than females (Quigley and Crawshaw 1992, Quigley and Crawshaw 2002). Dispersal through human-dominated landscapes may increase the likelihood of conflict with humans, particularly in areas where the habitat is highly fragmented (e.g. Sáenz and Carrillo 2002). The maximum age of last reproduction of a female recorded in the wild is 13 years (Brown and Lopez-Gonzalez 2001).<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013). Values for age at first reproduction and longevity were agreed to by experts at the 2012 National Action Plan workshop for Jaguars in Brazil, and can be used for generation length calculations as:<br/><br/>GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs<br/>R<sub>span</sub> = 15 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 11.5 yrs<br/><br/>Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/>Thus, GL = 11.5*0.29 +3.5 = 6.84 yrs for Jaguars.","Jaguar populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010a, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Nijhawan <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press), killing for trophies/illegal trade in body parts, pro-active or retaliatory killings associated with livestock depredation (Zimmermann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2008, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), and competition for wild meat with human hunters (Jorgenson and Redford 1993, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Deforestation rates in Latin America are the highest in the world together with tropical Africa (FAO forest update, D’Annunzio <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Industrial agriculture, along with subsistence agriculture, is the most significant driver of deforestation in tropical and subtropical countries, accounting for 80% of deforestation from 2000-2010. The current contribution of agriculture to deforestation varies by region, with industrial agriculture being responsible for 30% of deforestation in Africa and Asia, but close to 70% in Latin America. The most significant agricultural drivers of deforestation include soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching, all highly prevalent throughout Latin America (http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture). The produce is mainly used for export as raw products for developing countries, not to feed local populations. Fragmentation and displacement frequently leads to lowering of densities of Jaguars and prey in leftover forest patches due to easier access and Jaguars feeding on the replaced livestock. Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Latin America is characterized by relatively low population densities with high population growth (http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). This means that the increased agricultural expansion will likely not be used to feed the expanding population of Latin America. Increased pressure on wildlife as a food source will increase. Even in low population countries like Belize, 75% of the yearly wildlife offtake can be attributed to humans, while Jaguars only account for 25% (Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Increases in human population within these thinly populated countries means, increased fragmentation for agriculture, industry and urbanization necessary for sustaining the increased number of people, making the wildlife easier accessible for hunting. The greater need for food and potential increase in wealth for a proportion of the population means increased commercialization and increased prizes for wildlife game species, which are all Jaguar prey species.<br/><br/>Habitat loss is reducing and isolating Jaguar populations range wide (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Jaguars have lost about 49% of their historic geographic range (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em>et al.</em> 2016; current assessment). The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) an important Jaguar prey (e.g. Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010b), has been extirpated from 21% of its historical range during the past century and changed from NT to VU under the latest IUCN assessment (Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Keuroghlian <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Jaguars have become extinct in El Salvador, Uruguay, and the United States (where there are still periodic individuals present as presumed dispersers from Mexico) (TSJRT 2012, Campbell 2015). There are documented population declines and habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales. For example, the connectivity of Jaguar habitat between Honduras and Guatemala is almost gone; similar losses have been documented across the Chaco, Iguazu and Atlantic Forest, and between Tamaulipas and Veracruz (Haag <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). Many Jaguar populations require connectivity between core sites to survive in the long term and these connectivity corridors are most of the time outside protected areas, and therefore vulnerable to human impacts (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>The vulnerability of the Jaguar to persecution is demonstrated by its disappearance by the mid-1800 from Uruguay (Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016), El Salvador and by the mid-1900's from the south-western US (Johnson and Van Pelt 2016). Disappearance from these countries catches the current trends in a nutshell. These countries were the first areas to show rapid population increase with large scale land conversion. Retaliatory killing of the remaining exposed Jaguars led to their extinction. These processes are now taking place on a continental scale and therefore there are few areas within Jaguar range that can be considered safe. With limited technological expansion in the region, the main source of income will be industrial agriculture. With every (local) economic crisis, it means that the last Jaguar strongholds will be eroded further. Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.","<u><strong>Historic assessment of Jaguar viability </strong></u><br/><strong>High chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that populations in 70% of the Jaguar range (over 6 million km²) had a high probability for survival. Most of that area consists of the Amazon Basin rainforest, and adjoining areas of the Pantanal and Gran Chaco (Torres <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Other areas considered by Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) to have a high probability for long-term Jaguar persistence included tropical moist lowland forest in Mesoamerica (the Selva Maya of Guatemala, Mexico and Belize) and a narrow strip of the Choco-Darien of Panama and Colombia to northern Honduras.<br/><br/><strong>Medium chance of survival: </strong>Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that Jaguar populations in 18% of the Jaguar range (1.6 million km²) had a medium probability of long-term survival. These areas are generally adjacent to the areas considered to have a high-probability probability of survival and include a large portion of the northern Cerrado, most of the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos, and the northern part of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. In Central America and Mexico, they include the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama, southern Mexico, and the two eastern mountain ranges of Mexico, Sierra de Taumalipas and the Sierra Madre Oriental.<br/><br/><strong>Low chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) classified the remainder of Jaguar range (12%) as having a low probability for Jaguar survival, and of most urgent conservation concern. These areas include the Atlantic Tropical Forest and Cerrado of Brazil; parts of the Chaco in northern Argentina; the Gran Sabana of northern Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana; parts of the coastal dry forest in Venezuela; and the remaining range in Central America and Mexico.<br/><br/><strong><u>Current assessment of Jaguar populations</u></strong><br/><strong>Mexico</strong>: Jaguar densities in Mexico have been estimated from 0.75 to 6 adults per 100 km² (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016). The Jaguar population in the Selva Maya in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico was estimated in 2000 individuals (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Rodriguez-Soto <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). In the Greater Lacadona Ecosystem in southern Mexico, Jaguar density was estimated at 1.7-4.6/100 km², with an estimated population of 62 to 168 Jaguars within the protected areas of this region (de la Torre and Medellín 2011). Overall, Mexico’s national Jaguar census estimated at 4,000-5,000 individuals in 2011 (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press). The northern and central areas of Mexico are however becoming increasingly isolated with Jaguars disappearing where they were previously still detected (Grigione <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Rosas-Rosas and Bender 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Central America</strong>: Estimates of Jaguar density from Mesoamerica from 27 studies conducted from 2000 to 2010 range from 0.74 to 11.2 /100 km², however most of the studies did not cover the minimum area to ensure unbiased density estimates (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Nevertheless, across these sites density estimates were higher in tropical moist forest than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest, and higher in national parks compared to those from other multiple use areas (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Densities in the Belizean Selva Maya rainforest were estimated at 7.5-8.8/100 km² (Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). Jaguar density estimates in the protected lowland moist tropical forest of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize range from 3.5 (+/- SE = 0.7) to 11.0 (+/- 3.1)/100 km² (Harmsen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Jaguar density was found to decline across the human-influenced landscape, a mosaic of unprotected forest, savannah, agriculture and settlements with distance from the protected forest (Foster 2008). The Talamanca Mountains of Costa Rica and Panama support a Jaguar population, but the probability of long-term persistence is medium to low (Gonzalez-Maya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Similarly the Jaguar populations located in protected areas in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua are under a great pressure from deforestation and hunting (Petracca <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>South America</strong>: Jaguar density in the Brazilian Pantanal has been estimated as 6.6-6.7 /100 km², or 10.3-11.7/100 km² depending on the method used (telemetry versus camera traps, respectively, Soislao and Cavalcanti (2006). In the Bolivian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 2.8/100 km² (Madidi National Park Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004), and in the Colombian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 4.5/100 km² and 2.5/100 km² (Amacayacu National Park and unprotected areas respectively; Payan 2008). Estimates of Jaguar density are 2/100 km² in the savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, 3.5/100 km² in the semiarid scrub of the Caatinga, and 2.2/100 km² in the Atlantic Forest (Silveira 2004), and 2.2-5 per 100 km² in the Bolivian Gran Chaco (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). The Atlantic Forest subpopulation in Brazil has been estimated at 200+/- 80 adults (Leite <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002). Jaguar populations in the Chaco region of northern Argentina and Brazil, and the Brazilian Caatinga, are low-density and highly threatened by livestock ranching and persecution (Altrichter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, T. de Oliveira pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><u><strong>Historic methodological biases</strong></u><br/>Unfortunately, many of these reported density estimates have inadequate sample sizes of area or capture and recaptures. Careful reviews have shown that these estimates tend to be biased positively rather than negatively (Foster and Harmsen 2012, Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Tobler and Powell 2013). This means that many of the older publications from before 2010 tended to overestimate densities at an unknown quantity. It also means that previous assessments have been overly optimistic about Jaguar status throughout their range.<br/><br/><u><strong>Subpopulation status</strong></u><br/>De la Torre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2017) identified 34 Jaguar subpopulations where there is little likelihood of demographic or genetic exchange, and assessed each against Red List criteria. Overall, 97% met the criteria for Critically Endangered (25 subpopulations) or Endangered (eight subpopulations) (see Figure 3a-e in the Supplementary Material). The large Amazonia subpopulation, estimated to hold 89% of the total species population (57,000 out of 64,000), was assessed as Least Concern.",Decreasing,"The Jaguar is the largest cat of the Americas, and the only living representative of the genus <em>Panthera </em>in the New World (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Historically it ranged from the southwestern US (where there are still some vagrants close to the Mexican border) through the Amazon basin to the Rio Negro in Argentina (McCain and Childs 2008, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Its extent of occurrence (EOO) (updated with the collaboration of 44 experts—see the lists of Assessors and Contributors and the Assessment Rationale section for a thorough description) is estimated at 9.02 million km², with its stronghold the rainforest of the Amazon basin, which comprises 57% of its total EOO. The Jaguar has been virtually eliminated from much of the drier northern parts of its range—Arizona and New Mexico in the United States, and extreme northern Sonora state in Mexico—( Johnson and Van Pelt 2016), as well as northern Brazil, the pampas scrub grasslands of Argentina and throughout Uruguay (de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016). In 2002, Jaguars were estimated to occupy only about 46% of its historic range (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). With our improved knowledge of Jaguar range (see the Assessment Rationale and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), this percentage is set at 51% currently.<br/><br/>Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002) defined the most important areas for conservation of viable Jaguar populations (Jaguar Conservation Units or JCUs). These 51 areas cover 44.49 million km², or 49% of Jaguar range according to present calculations.","Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. The Jaguar is fully protected at the national level across most of its range, with hunting prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, United States, and Venezuela, and hunting restrictions in place in Guatemala and Peru (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Specific conservation plans for the species have been developed in Mexico, Panama, Honduras, and Brazil. <br/><br/>With habitat fragmentation a major threat, and taxonomic research suggesting little significant differences among Jaguar populations, an ambitious program has been launched to conserve a continuous north to south habitat corridor through the species range (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010).<br/><br/>Addressing livestock management and animals that prey on livestock is a high priority for conservation efforts in many Jaguar range countries due to the impact of retaliatory killing of Jaguars and other predators.<br/><br/><strong><u>Jaguar Conservation Actions</u><br/></strong>The following is a list of actions that a variety of Jaguar range countries have put in place to enhance Jaguar conservation. <br/><ol><li>Respond to reports of livestock depredation, and provide advice and assistance to improve livestock management practices, thereby reducing depredation and associated retaliatory killings of Jaguars; </li><li>Understand and address the hunting of Jaguar prey for sport, commercial and subsistence uses, and raise awareness about the laws governing the hunting of wildlife and the need for adopting sustainable hunting practices;</li><li>Monitor and safe-guarding Jaguar core populations, Jaguar Conservation Units, or JCUs (see Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010);</li><li>Maintain national and regional population connectivity through the identification of corridors for Jaguar movement between JCUs and applying conservation actions in those corridors through the engagement of corridor stakeholders as in the development of a Conservation Action Plan for the Central Belize Corridor (Kay <em>et al.</em> 2015);</li><li>Develop national, regional and local monitoring programs for Jaguars and their prey.</li></ol>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

In the coastal zone they are known to nest in&#160;<em>Rhizophora mucronata</em> and <em>Ceriops tagal</em>&#160;mangrove trees as well as a number of other tree species (Kemp <em>et al</em>. 2014, Razafimanjato <em>et al</em>. 2014). Annual productivity is low (0.15 young fledged per territory [Watson <em>et al.</em> 1999]<strong></strong>) because clutch-size is only one or two (three recorded at one nest in 2005) and only one chick is raised, due to siblicide (Watson 1998, Watson <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>; and in one third of breeding attempts no eggs are laid (Watson <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. However, there is evidence for the species exhibiting polyandry and co-operative breeding (Watson <em>et al. </em>1999, Razafimanjato <em>et al. </em>2017), and polyandrous breeding attempts may show greater productivity than pairs (Razafimanjato <em>et al. </em>2017).<p></p>","The species is threatened by direct human competition for fish-stocks (Watson 1998, Watson and Rabarisoa 2000)<strong></strong>, persecution through the taking of nestlings and shooting of adults, accidental entanglement in fishing-nets, disturbance at breeding sites by human activities and, according to local people, use of eagle body parts in food and traditional medicine (Rabarisoa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, H.R. Ratsimba&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006, Safford and Hawkins 2013)<strong></strong>.&#160;Capture of eagles for the pet trade is also a threat (Razafimanjato <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Deforestation, soil erosion and the development of wetland areas for rice-paddies is causing the on-going loss of nesting and foraging habitat (Rabarisoa <em>et al.</em> 1997, Berkelman <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Watson and Rabarisoa 2000, L.-A.

Surveys during 1991-1995 recorded at least 222 adults and 99 breeding pairs from 105 sites, apparently concentrated into three main regions: the Antsalova region west of Bemaraha Reserve, along the Tsiribihina River, and the coast from Mahajamba Bay to the island of Nosy Hara (Rabarisoa <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. Although this estimate is double an estimate from the period 1980-1985, this is probably due to more comprehensive surveying, and a decline in some areas was still recorded (Rabarisoa <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. Recent surveys suggest that the Antsalova district is the main stronghold, with 12 pairs in the Manambolomaty complex and a further 15 pairs elsewhere in the district in 2008 (L.-A.<strong> </strong>Réné<strong> </strong>de Roland <em>in litt.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, and the population is currently thought to comprise c.120 breeding pairs (R.

Since 1991, the species has been studied in the Antsalova region, where an on-going conservation programme aims to increase the known breeding population to at least 250 pairs. Activities to reach such a target include the enforcement of existing traditional laws at the local community level, and in two cases through the release of captive-reared birds rescued from siblicide (Rabarisoa <em>et al.</em> 1997, Peregrine Fund 1998, Watson 1998)<strong></strong>, with the latter almost doubling the number of young fledged per nest in one study (Watson <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Manambolomaty Three Lakes Complex is a Ramsar Site in the Antsalova area and official protection was confirmed for this site in 2015, and it is now called the “Tsimembo-Manambolomaty New Protected Area which protects 62,745 hectares of lakes, forests, mangroves and savanna habitats  (Peregrine Fund <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. This site and surrounding areas supported 20 territorial pairs and 50 adults in 2015, and a community-based, resource management programme (Local Management Secured System; GELOSE) means that threats to the species and its habitat both inside and outside of this area are relatively low (Razafimanjato <em>et al. </em>2017). The Mandrozo Lake New Protected Area, a new Ramsar site near Tambohorano was officially ratified in 2015 to protect 5 territorial pairs and 11 adults too.

The population is fragmented among eight subpopulations in 4–5 locations that are continuing to be threatened by extensive habitat loss and local extirpations due to excessive hunting and trade (this qualifies the species for an Endangered listing). There is a continuing decline in habitat quality due to agriculture and an increased mortality of cacti (their main food and shelter source). Local people interviewed describe a dramatic decrease in the wild iguana population over the last 26 years, particularly in the limits of its distribution. This information coupled with the illegal trade data that has been gathered over the last 10 years, demonstrates a pattern of at least 50% decline over the past 18 years (three generations), qualifying the species to be assessed as Endangered.","The Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana occurs in areas of dry forest and thorn scrub. The predominant plant species where iguanas are present are tree cacti, including Pitayo Organ Pipe Cactus (<em>Stenocereus pruinosus</em>) and Old Man Cactus (<em>Pilosocereus leucocephalus</em>), and tree species such as the Quebracho (<em>Lysiloma divaricatum</em>), Orotouaje (<em>Acacia picachensis</em>), Yaje (<em>Leucaena collinsii</em>), Yellow Plum (<em>Ximena americana</em>), and Yellow Bells (<em>Tecoma stans</em>). Iguanas use hollow trunks or branches of these cactus and trees as shelters, and are usually found inside using their spiny tails to block the entrance. This iguana is one of the main species that feeds on the fruit of the Pitayo Organ Pipe Cactus in the dry forest of Motagua Valley. The seeds of this cactus have been found in feces and also attached to the external gular parts of the iguanas (Cotí and Ariano 2008). A recent study demonstrated that germination percentage increases when seeds of the Pitayo Organ Pipe Cactus pass through the digestive tract of these iguanas (Vásquez-Contreras and Ariano-Sánchez 2016), thereby demonstrating its important role in forest regeneration.<br/><br/>The Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana is a keystone species for the dry forests of the Motagua Valley because its presence is considered crucial to maintaining the organization of the ecological community, by its position in the food chain and its important role as a seed disperser. The eggs of this iguana are one of the main food sources for the Motagua Valley Beaded Lizard (<em>Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti</em>; Ariano-Sánchez 2007). Though not formally listed, the beaded lizard is thought to be highly threatened and in extreme danger of extinction (Ariano-Sánchez 2006, Ariano-Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ariano-Sánchez and Salazar 2015). Therefore, maintaining a stable population of the iguana may also be relevant to conserving the beaded lizard.<br/><br/>The maximum size including tail for this iguana is 57 cm (male), and the average size for each sex including tail is 36.4 cm for females and 46.3 cm for males (Cotí 2008). The maximum longevity recorded for this iguana is 10.2 years in captivity, with the first reproduction at two years old (De Magalhäes and Costa 2009). The generation length is estimated to be six years. According to local hunters, this species lays 6–12 eggs each year and the incubation period is three months (Cotí 2008). The average home range for males is 4.07 hectares and 3.16 hectares for females. There are significant differences in average home range between dry season (4.60 hectares) compared to the rainy season (0.88 hectares; Gil-Escobedo 2016).","The main threat to the Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana is habitat loss, which is due primarily to the increase of watermelon crops, the construction of new residential zones within the Motagua Valley, and deforestation. In some areas, cattle farming has triggered land conversion. Open-cast mining projects also destroyed core habitat, however, this activity has temporarily stopped as of 2016. Local people interviewed describe a dramatic decrease in the wild iguana population over the last 26 years, particularly in the limits of its distribution. Coyotes, and feral dogs and cats exist within the range of this iguana, however, evidence of high rates of mortality due to predation has not yet been documented.<br/><br/>Field observations since 2002 have also shown an increase in mortality of the Pitayo Organ Pipe Cactus due to local changes in rainfall patterns; this cactus represents the main food source and shelter for the Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana. Additionally, it is expected that climate change will increase the frequency of droughts, severity of rains, and thus cause habitat shifts to higher elevations.","The total population size of Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguanas is not known. Based on population density data from one well-studied subpopulation (Heloderma Natural Reserve) and assuming uniform distribution across the range, the total population is estimated to be a maximum of 2,530 mature individuals and are considered to be within 4–5 locations based on proximity and cohesive threat pressures (D. Ariano unpublished data 2017). The population is fragmented into eight subpopulations; the largest subpopulation occurs between Sanarate, El Progreso, and Cabañas, Zacapa, and is thought to have approximately 1,000 mature individuals. The subpopulations are separated by the Motagua River, and large agricultural fields, ranches, and residential areas barren of suitable habitat. Local extinctions have occurred in some areas, such as Morazan in the El Progreso Department (Cotí and Ariano 2008).",Decreasing,"The Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana is restricted to the upper Rio Motagua Valley in eastern Guatemala and has an estimated extent of occurrence of 1,151 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;by minimum convex polygon enclosing all subpopulations. The area of occupancy is estimated at 498 km<sup>2</sup> (using a 1x1 km grid cell overlay). This lizard occurs at elevations ranging from 200 to 900 m above sea level.","The Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). However, it is known that illegal trade and over-harvesting of the Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana is occurring. People who catch iguanas for meat usually catch six individuals per month, while illegal traders usually catch 50 to 60 individuals per month. Internet and local market surveys have shown that this species is sold in at least Greece, Germany, and the United States at an average price of $90 USD per individual. All sales of this iguana outside of Guatemala are illegal, as governmental authorities in Guatemala have not issued exportation permits for this iguana to date. This illegal trade is thought to be the main cause of local extirpation of iguanas in some localities (Cotí and Ariano 2008).<br/><br/>The Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana is used as a protein source by local villagers. In some areas this iguana is heavily hunted in the breeding season for their eggs, which has a large negative effect on the survival and viability of wild populations (Cotí and Ariano 2008). Hunters catch gravid females to consume whole, or they make a ventral incision to extract the eggs, which is then sewn up and the iguana is released. Predictably, these animals soon succumb to bacterial infections and internal hemorrhages, resulting in fatality.",Terrestrial,"Zootropic, with the support of the International Iguana Foundation, has initiated a conservation project for the Motagua Spiny-tailed Iguana. The project includes environmental education for local villagers and children focusing on the importance of conserving this iguana and the development of a defined hunting season. The project involves a semi-captive breeding programme in a private reserve (Heloderma Natural Reserve) owned by Zootropic, and is within the range area of the iguana. Within this reserve there is also a scientific research station operated by Zootropic and its partners for monitoring the wild population and its habitat. The reserve encompasses 1.36 km<sup>2</sup>, and is the only area in which this iguana is afforded complete protection from hunting and habitat destruction.<br/><br/>An additional 14.2 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable iguana habitat exists within ten parks and reserves where habitat destruction is legally prohibited, and affects three of the eight subpopulations. Although this additional land is technically protected, there is little to no enforcement against hunting, thus iguanas have been extirpated in some of these areas.

Recent satellite telemetry and stable isotope data support earlier work (Allan 1994) that shows Ludwig’s Bustard to be nomadic and a partial migrant (Shaw 2013, Shaw &amp; Ryan 2015), moving to the western winter-rainfall part of its range in winter.  The breeding season spans from August-December, with the species nesting on bare ground with a clutch of 2-3 eggs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Jenkins and Smallie 2009)<strong></strong>. Chick-rearing is conducted solely by females (Jenkins and Smallie 2009)<strong></strong>. The diet includes invertebrates, some small vertebrates and vegetable matter, including the berries of <em>Lycium oxycladum</em>. There is strong evidence that the species undergoes movement with rains in pursuit of Orthoptera hatchlings, though vegetation remains important (Allan 1994). Flocks of up to 70 individuals have been recorded (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The primary threat to the species is collisions with overhead power lines, with potentially thousands of individuals involved in such collisions each year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Anderson 2002, Jenkins and Smallie 2009, Jenkins 2009, Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011, Shaw 2013)<strong></strong>. Bustards have limited frontal vision so may not see power lines, even if they are marked (Martin and Shaw 2010). Collision rates on high voltage transmission lines in the De Aar area of the Karoo may exceed one Ludwig's Bustard per kilometre per year (Anderson 2002, Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>, and there is evidence for this level of mortality on transmission lines across the Karoo, indicating that the problem is widespread (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011, Shaw 2013)<strong></strong>. Given that the extent of power lines in the Karoo is vast and expanding (Jenkins and Smallie 2009, J. Smallie <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>, with already over 17,000 km in place, it is estimated that such collisions alone are already enough to cause a rapid decline which may intensify in the future (Jenkins <em>et al. </em><em></em>2011). Recent surveys on the more prolific low voltage lines have also revealed substantial levels of mortality (Shaw 2013), and in addition to power lines wind farms are currently establishing in many parts of the Karoo. Other threats to this species include deliberate hunting, capture in snares set for mammals, poisoning and disturbance, with one satellite tracked bird likely hunted (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, J. Shaw unpubl. data).<br/><p></p>","Allan (1994) carried out a census in the 1980s and estimated the entire population of Ludwig’s Bustard at 56,000–81,000 individuals, of which 50–75% were thought to occur in South Africa (Anderson 2000). A recent repeat of this census (2010-2012) in the South African part of the range estimated the current South African population at 114,000 birds (95% CI 87,000-148,000) (Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2015), and so the total population is inferred to fall within the range of 100,000-499,999 individuals. While there is therefore no clear evidence that the population has declined as projected (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011), there is not enough information with which to understand the trend; Allan’s (1994) estimate was probably a significant underestimate, and the confidence intervals of the current estimate are very wide. Work is underway in Namibia to estimate the size of the Namibian population.",Decreasing,"<em>Neotis ludwigii</em> has a large range centred on the dry biomes of the Karoo and Namib in southern Africa, being found in the extreme south-west of <strong>Angola</strong>, western <strong>Namibia</strong> and in much of <strong>South Africa </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996; Anderson 2000)<strong></strong>. The global population has been previously estimated at 56,000-81,000 individuals (Allan 1994)<strong></strong>. However, this estimate is now approximately 20 years old, and in this time the species is suspected to have declined rapidly as a result of collisions with overhead power lines, for which there is currently no effective mitigation (Anderson 2002, Jenkins and Smallie 2009)<strong></strong>. <p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>A research project took place at the Percy  FitzPatrick Institute, University of Cape Town to: conduct a new census of the Ludwig's Bustard population  in South Africa, to compare with the last assessment in the 1980s (Allan  1994); thoroughly assess the magnitude of power line mortality through  regular line surveys across the Karoo; look at habitat use and patterns of local and regional movement of bustards through satellite tracking in relation to environmental conditions and the power grid; and to explore mitigation  options through experimentation of line marking devices (Shaw<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>2013). An extensive line-marking experiment devised by the Percy Fitzpatrick Institute was put up near De Aar in 2011 in conjunction with the Eskom - Endangered Wildlife Trust Strategic Partnership to test the two current devices used in mitigation in South Africa. In Namibia, NamPower are also working to implement effective mitigation measures (A. Scott and M. Scott <em>in litt.</em> 2010).    It is listed as Endangered in Namibia, and South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Scott <em>et al. </em>2015, Shaw 2015)<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to raise awareness to stop hunting, and to encourage the public to report mortality from power lines etc. All new infrastructure (power lines, wind turbines) should be sited and mitigated appropriately, and dangerous sections of line should be retrofitted with appropriate mitigation. Further research into mitigation measures for power line collisions, other than those being tested at the De Aar site, should be instigated as the results of such experiments take a long time to gather. Research to learn more about about key life history parameters for this long-lived bird is also crucial to facilitate more accurate assessment of the impacts of unnatural mortality. Extend research currently underway in South Africa to Namibia (J. Shaw <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012), and repeat census in 5-10 years (J.

Until better data can be obtained, it is listed as Vulnerable since its population appears to have undergone a rapid decline which, with threats continuing or increasing, is projected to continue. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is generally not migratory but those that inhabit seasonal wetlands are irregularly nomadic in response to water availability (<strong></strong>del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. The Ethiopian population, however, does appear to migrate locally<strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). It breeds in May-October, leaving the breeding area in November-December when the wetlands dry up, and returning with the rains in May-June<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> </strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996).  Other populations breed in territorial pairs (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong> between July and December with a peak during the months of August and September coinciding with the peak of the floods<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). The most southerly populations often breed a little earlier in July-August <strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). During the non-breeding season the species is fairly congregatory, occurring regularly in flocks of 10-50 individuals (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>, and there are reports of flocks of up to 1,000 in the Okavango Delta in April-May (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Habitat </strong>In South Africa this species was found to occupy large home ranges of approximately 16 km<sup>2</sup>, which consist largely (75%) of grassland with a small core of essential wetland breeding habitat <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006).<strong> </strong><em>Breeding </em>It nests in shallow sedge-dominated wetlands, often above 2,000 m altitude (<strong></strong>del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. In South Africa and Zimbabwe it breeds on undisturbed small permanent wetlands surrounded by grassland or miombo (<em>Brachystegia</em>) woodland in high rainfall areas with plateau topography (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005), where human disturbance is minimal<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> (</span>Archibald and Meine 1996)<strong></strong>. Ephemeral and seasonal wetlands may be used opportunistically by breeding pairs or serve as important post-breeding dispersal areas<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). In South Africa it relies on relatively undisturbed mid-altitude wetland-grassland mosaics<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006). Elsewhere in its range it breeds on large low-lying tropical, seasonal flood plains such as the Okavango Delta (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong> where wetlands are bordered by grasslands<strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). It may use man-made habitats such as dams (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Ethiopian population uses high-altitude wetlands in the Bale Mountains<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season the species continues to rely on wetland habitats surrounded by grassland<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006)<strong></strong>. It congregates at large wetlands on riparian floodplains, but also requires pristine or semi-pristine, high-altitude wetlands and grasslands in some places<strong>&#160;(</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996;&#160;Barnes 2000; Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 1998). It frequents dambos (depressions), permanently isolated wetlands (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006) and vleis<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>) as well as using grasslands, pastures, and occasionally cultivated fields for foraging (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Dams and pans are used as roosting sites during the non-breeding season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Ethiopian population is less dependent on wetlands during this season, generally moving to drier, lower elevation habitats including ploughed fields<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). Birds that breed in the Okavango Delta often move to recently burnt ground in the dry season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Diet </strong>The species feeds on rhizomes, roots and bulbs of sedges (<em>Cyperus</em> and <em>Eleocharis</em> spp. [Bento 2002]), and grass sward and seed (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). It will also take animals including small aquatic snails, fish and frogs<strong> </strong>(Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Chicks are reported to eat insects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>).<strong> Breeding site </strong>Preferred nesting sites are where grass and sedge marshes are bordered by drier, flat to sloping grassland meadows, with medium height vegetation and water up to 1 m in depth (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The nest is a large mound of plant material (reeds and sedges), 1 m in diameter and protruding 20 cm above the water surface, usually with a moat of open water about a metre in diameter around it. A significant proportion of nests in the Okavango Delta are on small mud islands two or three metres in diameter, exposed by 20-30 cm as floodwaters recede, and in these cases, the eggs are laid on few pieces of reed or sedge stems. Fidelity to the previous year's nesting area is suspected. The clutch size is one or two (68% and 32% of nests respectively, in Botswana)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>)<strong></strong>, however only one chick is raised from clutches of two and the other egg is abandoned<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Pittman 2007)<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong><strong></strong>. If a clutch or chick is lost, pairs may attempt to breed again<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. The incubation period is 33-36 days<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. Natural levels of nest predation appear to be high (Nkape 2004)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The first-hatched chick leaves the nest on its first day<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>, Nkape 2004)<strong></strong>, and may be particularly susceptible to predation at this time<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Nkape 2004)<strong></strong>. The fledging period is 135 days, but immature birds usually accompany their parents for their first year<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. Reproductive maturity is reached at about the age of seven and the species is monogamous, pairing for life.  <p></p>","The primary threat is loss and degradation of wetlands as a result of upstream river regulation, intensified agriculture, mining, drainage, invasive species such as <em>Mimosa pigra</em>, and rice cultivation (Burke 1996<strong>, </strong>W. R. J. Dean <em>in litt. </em>1999<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span><strong> </strong>Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002, McCann and Benn 2006, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Uys 2012). Other threats include nest disturbance<strong> </strong>(P. Leonard <em>in litt. </em>1999, P. Mundy <em>in litt. </em>1999,<strong> </strong>McCann and Benn 2006); grass-burning regimes (M. Herremans &amp; R. E. Simmons <em>in litt. </em>1999, T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), though in the non-breeding season burnt floodplains are used for feeding in some areas<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003); poisoning; collision with utility lines<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996); direct consumption of chicks; persecution, and traditional medicine<strong> </strong>(A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998). Increasing livestock farming, wars, desertification and agrochemicals are additional threats to the species's habitats<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Nest destruction through trampling by livestock is believed to be a problem<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The population is threatened by the illegal removal of eggs and chicks for international trade<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). Adults are also taken for trade and are hunted<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The level of exports from Tanzania is believed to exceed known legal exports<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The destruction of vegetation by fires probably leaves adults more susceptible to predation and hunting, and flood levels in turn influence the extent and intensity of fires (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Recent potential threats that could extensively affect a large portion of the Okavango Delta include the proposed hydroelectric scheme at Popa Falls in Namibia, papyrus cutting, channel modification, and the extensive aerial spraying of pesticide to eradicate the tsetse fly<strong> </strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The extent of suitable breeding habitat in the Zambezi Delta (Mozambique) and Kafue Flats (Zambia) and the suitability of remaining habitat for feeding is believed to have declined as a result of the interruption of the natural flooding regime by the Cahora Bassa (Tete province), Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe), and Itezhi-tezhi (Zambia) dams upstream, and hunting is also a threat in this country<strong> </strong>(Parker 2005, Bento <em>et al</em>. 2007). Breeding success appears to be low in the species<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b).<strong> </strong>A pre-fledging chick:adult ratio of 5.8% on the Okavango Delta in January 2003 indicates a low chick survival rate<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock 2003). However, each pair of this long-lived species needs to raise only two chicks that survive to adulthood over the course of their lifetimes for the population to remain stable<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The species is highly sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon home ranges which are impacted by adjacent land-use (Morrison and Bothma 1998).   <br/><p></p>","Its present world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals (Pittman 2007) or fewer (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), fewer than 8,000 individuals (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100, placed in the range 9,000-10,000. This increase though may not be a true increase in the population and further research to better understand the movements between the key flood plains in south-central Africa and the seasonal movements whereby cranes come together in large flocks in the drier season needs to be explored further (Morrison in press). This estimate roughly equates to 6,000-6,300 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Bugeranus carunculatus</em> is found in <strong>Ethiopia, </strong>(c.200 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2003, 2007]), <strong>Tanzania</strong> (c.200 [Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003]), <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong> (probably around 500 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007]), <strong>Zambia</strong> (c.4,500 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007]), <strong>Angola</strong> (c.500, perhaps declining<strong><sup> </sup></strong>[W.

The total population appeared stable from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996), however when estimates from the 1980s are compared with those from 2006, it is judged to have declined significantly<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), perhaps indicating declines in the last 10 years. The key Zambian population at the Kafue Flats reportedly fell in the mid-1990s (Archibald and Meine 1996, Burke 1996) and was estimated at c.1,000 individuals in 2002<strong> </strong>(Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002), but may now be as high as around 2,900 individuals (Shunangu <em>et al. </em>2015). Significant populations elsewhere in Zambia include the Liuwa Plains (1,900 individuals [Viljoen 2015]) and the Bangweulu Swamps (African Parks Foundation pers. comm.<em> </em>to K. Morrison 2016). The Okavango Delta in Botswana also holds a significant population, of between 1,200 and 1,300 birds (Hancock 2008). The comparison of 2002 estimates with those from 1993 suggests marked declines in Mozambique, Zambia and possibly Botswana (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The substantial reduction in numbers since 1993 apparently reflects real declines at individual sites and regions, although the 2002 estimate may be influenced by an improvement in accuracy relative to previous estimates (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007) or fewer<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), not more than 8,000 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals<strong> </strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100 (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). It exists in three disjunct populations, the large south-central population and small Ethiopian and South African populations<strong> </strong>(Jones <em>et al.</em> 2006, Pittman 2007), which may be relicts from its former range<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. Protected areas (including Ramsar Sites) have been established in several key wetlands, notably in Zambia, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996; T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000; T. Fakarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). A major environmental flows initiative is underway for the Zambezi River basin, addressing the restoration of natural flooding patterns, conservation of basin wetlands, and control of invasive species in the Zambezi River basin (Beilfuss and Brown 2010).&#160; Key wetlands targeted by the program include the Kafue Flats, Zambezi Delta, Liuwa Plain, Busanga Swamps, and others, covering about 40% of the global Wattled Crane population. The initiative is a partnership between Zambezi basin dam operators and water authories, NGOs (World Wide Fund for Nature, International Crane Foundation), universities in the basin countries, and other stakeholders. In South Africa, and some other countries, action has included legal protection, marking and relocation of powerlines, awareness programmes, and encouragement of habitat protection, security and management by private landowners (Archibald and Meine 1996, Barnes 2000<strong>,</strong> Burke 1996). In the Kafue Flats, more than 800 ha of invasive <em>Mimosa pigra</em> was eradicated through aerial spraying and community-involvement in manual cutting (Shanungu 2009), although much of this has regrown due to a lack of follow up action (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). A conservation group conducted aerial surveys, field research and a community awareness programme in the Kafue Flats (Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002). Aerial surveys, nest monitoring<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Motsumi and Hancock 2004a, Nkape 2004) and monitoring of adult:juvenile ratios<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b) took place annually on the Okavango Delta in the early 2000s. Surveys and monitoring occur in several countries in south-central Africa (Zambia [International Crane Foundation (ICF) / Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) Partnership, in partnership with the Zambian Department of National Parks and Wildlife; African Parks Foundation], Zimbabwe [BirdLife Zimbabwe], Namibia [Namibia Crane Working Group], South Africa [ICF/EWT Partnership; Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, in partnership with the Endangered Wildlife Trust; KwaZulu-Natal Crane Foundation]), and also aim to drive more awareness amongst local communities (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 1993, an action plan was developed for the species at the African Crane and Wetland Training Workshop (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 1996). A continent-wide programme for the species was launched in 2001 to monitor the species's status and threats, and help develop effective conservation programmes for the management of wetland systems<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). National conservation plans have been developed for Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Following a workshop in July 2000, the Wattled Crane Recovery Programme was initiated for the South African population<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Pittman 2007). There are currently five partners in this South African programme, one aim of which is to establish a viable captive population and supplement the wild population (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2012). The Johannesburg Zoo has also built a dedicated chick-rearing facility, and several captive management facilities throughout South Africa now participate in the breeding programme<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). In 2005, it was announced that a veterinary fence would be constructed to the east of the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park in Botswana, effectively extending the park boundary and protecting grasslands used by the species from the high density of livestock in the area<strong> </strong>(BirdLife Botswana 2006).

Improve protection of birds outside of protected areas such as the Jao/Boro rivers of Botswana<strong> </strong>(Gibson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Increase educational campaigns (A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998), targeting landowners with breeding cranes,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>as well policy makers (Burke 1996, T. Fokarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). Employ satellite tracking to study the species's movements across its range (BirdLife Botswana Crane Working Group 2004, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). In South Africa, work with farming communities to conserve natural grasslands that surround wetlands<strong> (</strong>McCann and Benn 2006).

The species breeds in huge colonies of many thousands of pairs, often mixed with Greater Flamingo <em>Phoenicopterus roseus<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></em>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<em></em><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>. The timing of breeding is irregular and varies geographically, depending on the timing of the rains, with individual adults often not breeding annually (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982), but it has been suggested that breeding failures (possibly over 10 or more years) may have no effect on the overall population dynamics (Parasharya <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The species is an obligate filter feeder and feeds during the night and early morning when the surface of the water is calm, primarily by swimming and filtering the algae near the surface with a specialised bill that contains up to 10,000 microscopic lamellae<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). When necessary, the species forms large dense feeding flocks that create calm water for feeding near the centre of the flock<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat </strong>The species breeds on large undisturbed alkaline and saline lakes, salt pans or coastal lagoons, usually far out from the shore, after seasonal rains have provided the flooding necessary to isolate remote breeding sites from terrestrial predators and the soft muddy material for nest building<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Brown and Root 1971, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, McCulloch and Irvine 2004)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet </strong>It has a highly specialised diet consisting almost entirely of microscopic blue-green algae (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Spirulina</span> spp., <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Oscillatoria</span> spp. and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lyngbya</span> spp.) and benthic diatoms (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Navicula</span> spp., Bacillariophyceae) found only in alkaline lakes, salt pans and saline lagoons and estuaries<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).

Bennun <em>in litt.</em> 1999). In 2008, these proposals were still on hold, but had not been withdrawn (Anderson 2008). Other threats include land-claim, water pollution, and collisions with electric wires (NamPower/ Namibia Nature Foundation Strategic Partnership 2010, Tere and Parasharya 2011).

The global population has been estimated at c.2,220,000-3,240,000, including c.650,000 in Asia (Rose and Scott 1997)<strong></strong>. The largest population, estimated to be 1.5-2.5 million birds, occurs on the alkaline-saline lakes of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa (Delany and Scott 2006), with approximately 105,000 individuals at Lake Natron, Tanzania (Clamsen <em>et al. </em>2011). Smaller populations occur in the Rann of Kachchh in north-western India, estimated to be approximately 390,000 birds, in southern Africa, estimated to be 55,000-65,000 birds, and in West Africa, estimated to be 15,000-25,000 birds (Delany and Scott 2006)<strong></strong>.

However, the overall rate of decline is difficult to clarify owing to large-scale movements of individuals within the continent (Zaccara <em>et al. </em>2008) and between Africa and India (Parasharya <em>et al. </em>2015).

The majority of breeding colonies are extremely small and isolated, and many are close to the minimum for long-term viability. Forest throughout its range is disappearing rapidly, leading to further fragmentation and rapid decline of remaining populations. It is therefore classified as Vulnerable. Its long-term future will depend on the continued existence and proper management of the forest reserves and other protected areas in which it occurs. <p></p>","<p>It is found in lowland primary and secondary forest, forest clearings, and gallery forest mainly in rocky, hilly terrain (up to 800 m on Mt Nimba) (Gatter 1997, Thompson 1997, 1998, L. D. C. Fishpool <em>in litt.</em> 1999), but has survived at highly degraded sites and close to urban centres (Salewski <em>et al</em>. 2000, Thompson and Fotso 2000), perhaps indicating a fairly high tolerance of disturbance (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). The species is found in the proximity of flowing streams and rivers, where wet mud may be gathered for nest construction (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). A study of the ecology and distribution of the species in Ghana indicated that it uses fresh earthworm mounds to construct its nest (Asamoah 2011). It is known from montane forests in Sierra Leone and Liberia (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). It feeds mainly on invertebrates, usually singly and largely within one metre of the forest floor (Thompson and Fotso 1995). Individuals frequently follow army ant columns to capture flushed prey (Thompson 1998, Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). They take beetles, termites, ants and grasshoppers, as well as earthworms, spiders and vertebrates such as frogs and lizards (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). There is some evidence that vertebrates in the diet during the breeding season may be fed largely to nestlings (Thompson 1997). It breeds in colonies of up to 40 pairs (although the majority consist of only 2-5, and many nests stand alone [Thompson 2004b]), on rock-faces, cliffs, cave roofs and walls and infrequently in large, fallen hollow trees (Thompson and Fotso 1995, Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996b, Gatter 1997, Thompson 1998); rocky sites are the most common, however. In lowland forest breeding follows rainfall and maybe be once or twice yearly as a result (Thompson and Fotso 2000). The species appears to be monogamous (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). The nest is a cup-shaped mud construction in which dried leaves, fibres and twigs are embedded (Thompson 2004b). In Sierra Leone, egg-laying occurs from early June until late December, and chicks occupy nests from August to January (Thompson 2004a, b) Egg-laying in Ghana starts from early March and continues through to mid-December (Asamoah 2011). Clutch size is one or two (Thompson 1997). In Sierra Leone, the most common clutch size was found to be two, with incubation lasting for 17-23 days and the fledging period lasting for 23-29 days (Thompson 2004b). Nest mortality was caused by predation and infanticide by other adults, and breeding success was only 0.44 chicks fledged per pair. Natural nest predators probably include cobras <em>Naja</em> sp., Monitor Lizards <em>Varanus niloticus</em>, Forest Sun Squirrels <em>Heliosciurus</em>, raptors and colobine monkeys <em>Procolobus</em> sp.. The low breeding success of the populations studied in Sierra Leone suggest that they are in decline, that is unless adult survival exceeds 90% and the species is very long-lived (Thompson 2004b).&#160; </p>  <p></p>","The species is threatened throughout its range primarily by commercial logging for timber. Most sites identified in Ghana are in productive forest reserves, where commercial logging takes place periodically (Owusu and Asamoah 2008, Asamoah 2011)<strong></strong>. In Ghana, the species is also threatened by bush-burning and conversion of degraded forests to plantations (Asamoah 2011)<strong></strong>. Many nesting areas in Ghana, especially those outside protected areas, have been destroyed through clearance for agriculture and bush-burning (Asamoah 2011)<strong></strong>. In Ghana, it may also be threatened by mining for gold, manganese and bauxite (<strong></strong>Holbech 1996, Asamoah 2011)<strong></strong>. In Sierra Leone, abandonment of colonies has been associated with habitat degradation (Thompson 1997)<strong></strong>, and low breeding success at some sites is associated with human disturbance (Thompson 1998)<strong></strong>. Small populations near urban centres in Sierra Leone are severely threatened by conversion to farmland (Thompson and Fotso 2000)<strong></strong>. Logging and other forms of forest clearance may threaten presently unknown sites for the species, particularly in the mountains of western Côte d'Ivoire and south-eastern Guinea (H. Rainey<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Nest-predation and competition from conspecifics, e.g. for limited nest-sites, (Thompson 1997)<strong></strong> are other factors. Some opportunistic trapping with noose traps and wire snares may occur e.g. for zoo-collecting (R. Fotso <em>per</em> M. Gartshore <em>in litt.</em> 1999, H. S. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2007<strong></strong>). In Sierra Leone, children have recently been observed taking eggs (Thompson 2004b)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","The total population is estimated at fewer than 10,000 individuals.

It was thought to be extinct in Ghana until one individual was trapped at Subim Forest Reserve (Anon. 2006) in the Brong-Ahafo Region. Follow-up surveys in the Subim and adjoining Ayum and Bonsam Bepo forest reserves located 13 active nests and two individuals (Anon. 2006). Further investigations have since located other sites for this species, including seven major nesting areas within the high forest zone, with possibly over 100 nests at 33 sites (Dowsett-Lemaire and Dowsett 2009, Asamoah 2011, Dowsett-Lemaire and Dowsett 2014). In Sierra Leone, numbers are estimated at c.1,400, with populations in forest reserves close to the minimum for long-term viability, and surveys of the Western Area Peninsula Forest indicating a decline of 20% in the number of nests between 1997-2007 (Anon. 2008), although the population in Gola Forest may be stable (Monticelli <em>et al. </em>2012). In Liberia, the minimum population is estimated at 1,000 pairs (Gatter 1997). The global population in the Upper Guinea forest is almost certainly far fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, and this is supported by estimates for range states provided by various sources (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. Following the rediscovery of the species in Ghana by museum collectors from the U.S.A. in March 2003 (Marks <em>et al.</em> 2004, Anon. 2006), the Ghana Wildlife Society has begun to determine the status of the species in the country (R. Dowsett<em> in litt.</em> 2005, Anon. 2006, A. Asamoah<em> in litt</em>. 2007) and efforts are underway to protect the species in the reserves where it has been located (Marks <em>et al.</em> 2004). Some important nesting sites have been identified, and monitoring of the population and breeding activity at an active nesting area in Adansi South district is being carried out (A. Asamoah<em> in litt</em>. 2007), with community involvement and education programmes initiated (Oxford Miller 2013). A <em>Picathartes</em> working group has recently been formed, to promote research and conservation action (H. S. Thompson <em>in litt.</em> 1999). An International Action Plan for the species was published in 2004 following an international stakeholder workshop, with the aim to stabalise or increase its populations at its strongholds in all range states within five years (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). A one-year programme to initiate population monitoring, recruitment and training of wardens (resulting in the establishment of a wardening system around all known colonies) and awareness-raising activities has been carried out in the Western Area Peninsula Forest, Sierra Leone (H. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Anon. 2008). The species is protected by national law in some states (e.g. Ghana, Sierra Leone, Cameroon), but enforcement is minimal (Thompson and Fotso 2000, Thompson 2004b, R. Fotso and E. Owusu <em>per</em> Thompson 2004b). Although a high proportion of the populations in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire occur in nominally protected areas, the population of Liberia occurs almost wholly in unprotected habitat (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). An ongoing conservation programme has been working towards the upgrading of Gola Forest to a National Park (H. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2007), which has now been realized. A memorandum of understanding has been signed by the Liberian government to significantly increase the size of the country's protected area system (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). The species is protected by local religious beliefs in some areas (Thompson and Fotso 1995).  <p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Undertake surveys to estimate population sizes and distribution particularly in mountains of western Cote d'Ivoire, which may have many small colonies in remaining unlogged forest reserves (Holbech 1996, Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004, H.

Improve breeding success at selected strongholds by mitigating against limiting factors (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). Monitor and assess the impact of human-related activities on the species and its sites (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). Assess the legal status of human activities threatening sites and enforce the law where appropriate (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). Develop and implement management plans for the species's strongholds (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). Determine the area around the species's sites required to ensure survival and lobby for legal protection (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). Employ wardens at key sites (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). Incorporate the species's International Action Plan into national conservation strategies (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004). Where feasible, protect large breeding colonies through agreements and collaboration with local people. Incorporate the species into management plans and exclude logging from the immediate vicinity of active nesting sites (Asamoah 2011). Conduct genetic studies using samples from different subpopulations to assess the effective population size and the degree of inbreeding. Raise awareness of the species amongst all stakeholders, especially local communities (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2004).

It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered.  <p></p> <p></p>","It inhabits lowland dry, or seasonally inundated, natural and semi-natural grasslands, often interspersed with scattered scrub or patchy open forest. Some Indian populations appear to be resident, but the species may make short distance movements away from breeding areas with the arrival of the monsoon as vegetation becomes too dense for it (R. Jha <em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). These movements may take the species into areas of low human density with short-grazed grasslands and low-intensity agriculture (A. Rahmani and R. Jha <em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). In Cambodia, the species is known to make relatively local seasonal movements in response to the flooding regime of the Tonle Sap lake: in the dry season, the species breeds in grasslands in the inundation zone of the lake and then moves to nearby agricultural and degraded deciduous dipterocarp forest during the wet season (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016). During the breeding season, males preferentially select habitats related to low-intensity human activity, chiefly burned grassland, whereas females primarily select unburned grassland, but also use unburned, uncultivated grassland in dry-season rice head-ponds (Gray<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2009), although anecdotal evidence suggests that eggs are laid in small pockets of medium to tall grass in recently burnt areas (R. van Zalinge <em>pers. obs.</em>).<br/><p></p>","In South Asia, most populations are small, isolated and vulnerable to local extirpation. The key threats are the extensive loss and modification of grasslands through drainage, conversion to agriculture and plantations, overgrazing, inappropriate cutting, burning and ploughing regimes, heavy flooding, invasion of alien species, scrub expansion, dam construction and inappropriate and illegal development (Brahma and Lahkar 2009, Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Ibbett <em>et al. </em>2017). In particular, the spread of dry season rice cultivation in Cambodia is rapidly converting existing grassland habitat (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). An increase in the area of scrub vegetation between 1995/1996 and 2005 was responsible for 65% of grassland loss in Cambodia (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Land sales and concessions are often pushed through despite resistance from local villagers (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Excessive hunting for sport and food may have triggered the species's decline, but owing to advocacy and law enforcement this is no longer a serious threat, at least in Cambodia. Other threats may include human disturbance and trampling of nests by livestock. Detailed research into the species's ecology in Cambodia demonstrated that the effects of human disturbance are weak and annual burning is important for maintaining suitable habitat, supporting the idea that community-based grassland management that maintains traditional agricultural practices will benefit the species. This has implications for management in South Asia, where remaining (and declining) populations are largely confined to strictly protected areas in which such practices may not be occurring (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Further study has revealed that, whilst burned grassland is selected by males during the breeding season, unburned grassland and other habitats providing cover are selected by females, demonstrating the need for management that provides a variety of habitats (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009b). Proposed development of powerlines in Cambodia could prove to be a significant emerging threat to the species there (Mahood <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><p></p>","The population in Cambodia was estimated at 294 displaying males or c. 600 individuals in 2009 (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2009a), but recently an extensive survey has reported a total of only 432 individuals (95% CI 312-550) (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). 75-96 individuals remain in Nepal (Baral<em> et al. </em>2013). No recent total population estimates are known from India, but &gt;100 males were recorded in the country in recent surveys, with the population in D'Ering Wildlife Sanctuary potentially holding 50-60 territorial males (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). Given these estimates, the total global population for this species is tentatively placed in the range 250-999 mature individuals. This equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species&#160;has two disjunct populations, one in the Indian Subcontinent, the other in South-East Asia (BirdLife International 2001).

It has declined dramatically and only survives in small, highly fragmented populations; although modelling work suggests that there are large areas of suitable habitat that could contain larger populations, especially in areas around the Brahmaputra River (Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). Declines have apparently continued even inside protected areas e.g. Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, Dudhwa and&#160;Pilibhit parks, India&#160;(Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, R.

Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). Additionally, island surveys of the Brahmaputra River in 2015 revealed the presense of 5-6 birds in as many river islands, while 12-15 adult male birds were found on the Sadia plains and river islands (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Arunachal Pradesh, 5-7 male floricans were seen in a private grassland in Nizambhat, and a new population with up to 29 territorial males was found in April-June survey in 2016 in D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary in East Siang District (Rahmani 2016). It is estimated that 60-70 territorial males could be present in D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary, making it one of the most important areas for <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">floricans in India (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Uttar Pradesh, India, the numbers appears to have declined, as only 8 territorial males were seen in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, down from 24 seen in 2001, while a small population of 5-6 males was found in Pilibhet Tiger Reserve. As females are extremely difficult to see, their number was not recorded as part of these surveys.&#160;An estimate from 2007 put the Nepalese population at just 28-36 mature individuals (restricted to a few widespread sites) (Poudyal 2007), down from 32-60 individuals in 2001. Recent intensive survey effort in Nepal has recorded 47 individuals in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, including 14 birds outside any protected area and an estimate of 60 individuals in total (Baral <em>et al. </em>2013). This is almost double the numbers from a survey of the area in 2012 when around 12 pairs were estimated (Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012), but this is due to a more rigorous survey methodology (Baral <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;This is the largest population in Nepal (Baral <em>et al. </em>2013) and, if numbers from the 2007 survey are still accurate, this would put the total number of mature individuals in Nepal at 75-96.&#160;<br/>The South-East Asian population occurs in <strong>Cambodia</strong> and may be extant in southern <strong>Vietnam</strong>. The population in the Tonle Sap region, which supports the vast majority of the population of Cambodia, was estimated at between 312 and 550 based on surveys in 2012, with only 216 displaying males recorded (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). This represents a 44% decrease from the previous survey in 2005, and a minimum of 294 displaying males had been recorded in 2007 (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009a). If the population continues to decline at the current rate, it may become extinct in Cambodia within 10 years (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). More than 80% of the Cambodian population occurs on seasonally inundated grasslands within Kompong Thom province (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016). This estimate, based on the extent of available habitat in 2005 and known habitat loss between 2005 and 2007, represents a rapid decline owing to habitat loss, from a projected 3,000 individuals in 1997 (T. Gray, T. Evans and H. Chamnan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006). Given accelerating post-2005 grassland loss of 28% within 10 grassland blocks holding 75% of the estimated population (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a), and a further 11% of habitat lost in four protected areas in 2008 (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009), projected rates of decline will equate to over 80% during a three generation period (T. Gray, T. Evans and H. Chamnan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006). Recent assessment of habitat loss indicates that it has indeed been widespread and extensive between 2005 and 2012, and a number of sites identified as having blocks of grassland in excess of 10 square kilometers now contain little or no grassland (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013). Stoung-Chikreang BFCA and unprotected grasslands at Sankor support the highest populations (45 and 69 displaying males respectively in 2014), but estimates vary from year to year and population of the two sites is probably 100-150 displaying males (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Annual monitoring of Bengal Florican populations in Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs) and adjacent areas in Cambodia during March-April 2008-2016 indicates that whilst populations in some protected areas are stable, in other locations population declines are ongoing.

Tiny, perhaps unsustainable populations may still remain at Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Reserve, Cambodia, and within the Mekong Delta at Boeung Prek Lapouv Sarus Crane Reserve, Cambodia, and Tram Chim National Park, Vietnam. A research project investigating movements and habitat requirements in the non-breeding season began in 2007, where individuals were fitted with satellite or radio transmitters; the data from which have revealed previously unknown non-breeding sites (see Packman 2009). The Wildlife Conservation Society, BirdLife International and their government partners are engaged in a programme of conservation activities in the Tonle Sap floodplain of Cambodia, aimed at reducing habitat loss and hunting pressure on the species (A. W. Tordoff <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Achievements so far include the designation of 173 km<sup>2</sup> of breeding and 138 km<sup>2</sup> of non-breeding habitat as Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs). Populations in the BFCAs and in adjacent areas have been monitored annually since 2008 using a survey which employs a randomised sampling design to measure occupancy of 1 km<sup>2</sup> squares by displaying males, which allows results to be extrapolated within and across sites to obtain accurate population and trend data. These data indicate that the population is probably stable at some BFCAs and possibly declining in others and in adjacent areas (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009, 2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Suitable habitat in BFCAs continues to be lost to various threats, including the expansion of dry season rice cultivation and dam construction (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2010), although overall habitat loss outside BFCAs has been much greater. <br/><br/>Work is on-going to maintain effective management structures for these areas and build constituencies of support for their conservation among local stakeholders. Official patrol teams are now operating in Kampong Thom and Siem Reap, and in both provinces the Forestry Administration, working through provincial commissions, has already halted several proposed developments which would otherwise have destroyed vital breeding habitat (Eames 2007, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, 2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Changes in land use in the Tonle Sap floodplain and in the BFCAs in particular are also monitored with the aid of aerial and/or satellite images (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). When land encroachment in the BFCAs is detected through patrols or satellite-monitoring, WCS facilitates meetings between the parties concerned to resolve disputes and reverse encroachment. An in-depth socio-economic study has been conducted by the Centre d'Etude et de Développement Agricole Cambodgien. The report highlights the economic benefits local communities derive through the traditional use of grasslands and is used to build support among key decision makers and local communities. An awareness programme covering 71 villages and over 3,200 people was conducted in 2008/2009, and outreach activities in schools and villages are ongoing. Training in selected villages was conducted to improve agricultural systems and reduce the immediate pressure on grasslands from people wanting to convert grasslands into agriculture (BirdLife International 2009). Villagers receive financial rewards for reporting nests which they incidentally find as a deterrent against collecting and eating the eggs; finders receive an additional financial reward if the nest fledges successfully, although nest-finders are discouraged from protecting the nests directly to reduce accidental disturbance to birds (van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). <br/><br/>At the four breeding season BFCAs, community management committees have been established to act as intermediaries between WCS, government partners and the communities, they assist in awareness raising, patrolling and reporting illegal activities in the BFCAs. At one of the BFCAs rice is purchased at a premium from local farmers abiding by conservation agreements under a wildlife-friendly rice initiative and community members gain an additional income from acting as guides to birdwatchers visiting the site through the Sam Veasna Centre. These activities appear to be having some early success in arresting the rapid decline of the species in Cambodia, but their long-term outcome remains to be seen.<br/><br/>In 2012, a Darwin Initiative project was initiated to look at the species's distribution and habitat requirements in India and Nepal (Barber 2013). In Nepal, two male birds were satellite-tagged in April 2013 (Barber 2013), followed by two females and a male in 2014 and three males in India in 2014 (Barber 2014), and a further two males have been tagged in Nepal and one male in India (R. Jha&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). As a result of the tagging work, conservationists will be able to identify important areas for the species and propose suitable management regimes. Trial habitat plots have also been established to understand habitat preferences.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue annual monitoring of the population in the BFCAs, Cambodia, and replicate the monitoring protocol in key sites in India and Nepal. Conduct research on breeding productivity and habitat utilisation in breeding and non-breeding BFCAs. Introduce a protected area management regime, including appropriate rotational burning, grazing and cutting based on research findings; and promote appropriate land-management actions in non-protected areas, e.g. low intensity agricultural areas that are used in the non-breeding season (see Jha <em>et al.&#160;</em>&#160;2018). Promote grassland conservation awareness initiatives in all range countries. Strengthen the legal protection for existing BFCAs and expand the network (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2009, 2010, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Continue surveys for populations, particularly in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve and Koshi Barrage, Nepal (Poudyal 2007). Identify additional important sites for birds in the non-breeding season in Cambodia. Land acquisition outside the BFCA network and/or conservation concessions may be required to protect important areas for the species (Handschuh 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Extend, upgrade, link and improve enforcement in protected areas in India and Nepal, and establish new ones. Devise and promote a conservation strategy for all Asian bustards. Share best practice guidelines for management of small bustards in grassland habitats across Europe and Asia. Encourage community engagement to try to improve the level of protection within protected areas, and investigate potential initiatives to promote conservation-friendly development, such as the Sustainable Rice Platform (Ibbett <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><p></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It has also, though, been found in secondary woodland and occurs in degraded woodland (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, including dead juniper habitat. It is shy, elusive and occurs in small parties in dense vegetation (Madge and McGowan 2002)<strong></strong>, hence it is not recorded in dead or dying juniper habitats which are more open (Bealey and Rayaleh 2006)<strong></strong>. The presence of a population in the Mabla Mountains, where juniper is effectively absent, may indicate that habitat structure rather than species composition of woodland may be a key ecological factor (Welch <em>et al. </em>2009a)<strong></strong>. A detailed survey in the Forêt du Day suggested that the presence of closed-canopy forest may be more important to the species than juniper health (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). It feeds on seeds, berries and termites, and also figs from the forest edge (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. The breeding season is from December to February (McGowan 1994)<strong></strong>. It is probably monogamous, laying a clutch of 5-7 eggs; the only known nest was a shallow grass-lined depression on an inaccessible mountain ledge (Madge and McGowan 2002)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","At Forêt du Day, juniper woodland is in poor condition, with virtually all trees dead or dying by now. The reasons for this are unclear, but the high level of grazing by cattle, camels and goats is certainly a problem in much of the woodland, possibly exacerbated by acid rain, climate change and fungal disease (Magin 2001). Most local people (57%) interviewed in the Forêt du Day attribute high juniper mortality to drought (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). A survey in 2007 showed that in areas of high tree cover or poor juniper condition, the presence of <em>P</em><em>. ochropectus</em> was negatively correlated with grazing intensity, especially that of cattle (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). Within 18 months of the restoration of an exclosure, juniper seedlings (which were non-existent elsewhere) were found to be frequent under living juniper trees, suggesting grazing has indeed been the main cause of the decline of the forest (Ford 2008)<strong></strong>. Other concerns include collection of firewood on lower slopes (Magin 2001), hunting, egg harvesting (McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2014) and human disturbance (G. R. and H. J. Welch <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. At Mabla, there are signs of significant human disturbance in the remaining stands of woodland, which have been heavily exploited for firewood and grazing (Magin 2001). Having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International <em>unpubl. data</em>)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Following a detailed survey of the Forêt du Day in 2007, the population there was estimated at 450 individuals, with 95% confidence intervals giving a range of 285-705 individuals, including juveniles. Potential limitations of that study might mean that the population lies in the lower half of the range estimate, i.e. 285-450 individuals. A 2009 survey estimated the size of the Mabla population at 108 individuals. Taking these survey results into account, the entire population is estimated at fewer than 500 mature individuals (likely 200-500). This roughly equates to 300-750 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"<em>Pternistis ochropectus</em> is endemic to <strong>Djibouti</strong>, where it is known from only two sites: Forêt du Day in the Goda Massif (c. 14-15 km<sup>2</sup> [McGowan<em> et al.</em> 1995]<strong></strong>) and the nearby Mabla Mountains. Available habitat at Forêt du Day was halved between 1977 and 1983 (McGowan 1994), with a corresponding decline in the population from 5,600 to 1,500 birds between 1978 and 1985 (McGowan<em> et al.</em> 1995). The population at Forêt du Day was estimated at c. 500-1,000 in 1998 (G. R. and H. J. Welch <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>.&#160;Tracewski<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;(2016) estimated the maximum Area of Occupancy (calculated as the remaining forest cover within the species’s range) to be c.0.8 km<sup>2</sup>.&#160;Figures released in 2006 indicate that 95% of plateau juniper (the preferred habitat) was either dead or dying (Bealey and Rayaleh 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Nevertheless, immature birds continue to be seen and the ability of woodland with dead juniper and woodland largely devoid of juniper to support the species remains poorly understood. Survey work by the World Pheasant Association in collaboration with Djibouti Nature led to a population estimate for the Forêt du Day population of 612-723 adults (Bealey and Rayaleh 2006)<strong></strong>. This was followed by a detailed survey in 2007, from which the same population was estimated at 450 individuals (95% CI: 285-705 individuals) (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009).

Research to clarify the species's range and population numbers is ongoing, including preliminary planning for surveys in other ranges between the two known locations. Meetings have been held with local communities to discuss the establishment of Site Support Groups (SSGs) for Forêt du Day and Mabla (Rayaleh 2008)<strong></strong>. By early 2010, a small SSG had been formed for Forêt du Day and was already active (H. Rayaleh<em> in litt</em>. 2010)<strong></strong>.

Seminars have been held at Djibouti University to discuss the species's status and establishment of a Djibouti Francolin Working Group, and more conferences are planned (H. Rayaleh<em> in litt</em>. 2010).

Conduct ecological studies to determine habitat limits and reproductive ecology of the species, especially whether there is seasonal dependence upon juniper forest. These will be aided by the use of radio-tagging which requires development of suitable catching techniques. Implement community-based juniper forest restoration through planting, assisted regeneration and the maintenance of local plant nurseries. Limit grazing in areas of juniper regeneration and high abundance of <em>P</em><em>. ochropectus</em> (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). Expand awareness-raising programmes to ensure local people are aware of the value of the species and its habitat to improve participation in other conservation actions. Involve local stakeholders by convening a Protected Area Management Group in the Goda and Mabla areas. Create a working group within Djibouti to promote conservation of the species and its habitat. Develop a long-term integrated management project for the Goda massif, involving socio-economic and agro-pastoral surveys and a conservation education programme (currently being trialed in five local schools by Djibouti Nature).

Habitat loss and alteration are also thought to be contributing to declines.<p></p>,"When breeding, it is almost always associated with its main food source, flowering Tasmanian blue gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eucalyptus globulus</span>. Flowering may be sufficient to support breeding in only three years out of every 10. In poor years, swamp (black) Gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. ovata</span> is used as food source (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). Overall, the availability and flowering of the feed trees can severely affect the availability of breeding habitat (Tzaros <em>et al</em>. 2009). Most breeding birds are found in remnant forest patches of less than 0.01 km<sup>2</sup>. They nest in hollows of both live and dead eucalypt trees (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2007). The most common tree species used for nesting are stringybark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. obliqua</span>, white peppermint <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. pulchella </span>and Tasmanian blue gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span>, white gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. viminalis</span>, gum-topped stringybark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. delegatensis</span> and dead stags (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Several pairs often nest in close proximity, in the same or neighbouring trees<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>. On the mainland, it occurs in eucalypt forest and woodlands, mainly box-ironbark habitats on the inland slopes of the Great Dividing Range and in coastal forests. Critical food resources occur within this habitat, principally nectar from prolific flowering species such as red ironbark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. tricarpa</span>, grey box <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. microcarpa</span>, yellow gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. leucoxylon</span> and mugga ironbark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. sideroxylon </span>on the western slopes, and Swamp Mahogany<span style=""font-style: italic;""> E. robusta</span> and spotted gum<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Corymbia maculata</span> in coastal areas.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>Lerp (sugary secretions from sap sucking insects on leaves; D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2007) is also a favoured food source and is occasionally preffered over blossom, even when abundant blossom is available where birds are present (M. Roderick, D. Ingwersen pers. obs.). During the winter the birds are semi-nomadic and visit a network of traditional sites in reaction to flowering events and lerp availability (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005). Their wintering distribution varies greatly between years, depending on climatic conditions and the resulting food availability (Saunders and Heinsohn 2008). However it will also repeatedly use the same sites between years and often remain in winter foraging habitats for extended periods within a season (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). In some years, urban landscapes containing indigenous or non-local flowering eucalypts are also readily used (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2003). The importance of larger trees as a food source has been shown in this species's breeding range (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004) and wintering range (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005), as such trees tend to offer a more reliable and abundant source of nectar. Individuals can travel up to 5,000 kilometres between their mainland wintering grounds and their Tasmanian breeding sites, making theirs the longest migration undertaken by any parrot in the world (Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><p></p>","Nest predation by Sugar Gliders&#160;<em>Petaurus breviceps</em> introduced to Tasmania&#160;poses a severe threat (Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and is estimated to cause severe declines over the next three generations (Heinsohn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Surveys revealed that&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;predated nests and the probability of a nest surviving the 60-day nesting period when&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;were present was 0.17&#160;(Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). On mainland Tasmania almost 79% nests were predated and 65% of adult females were killed by Sugar Gliders. Predation was most severe in locations with low forest cover. Owing to the fact that Swift Parrot breeding distribution varies widely between years the extent of nest predation is also expected to vary annually depending on the distribution of&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;and forest cover. Sugar Gliders have not been reported from Bruny Island, a Swift Parrot breeding site.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and alteration within breeding and drought refuge habitats remains a key threat. In Tasmania, breeding habitat is significantly reduced and fragmented through clearance of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> for agriculture, residential development, plantation timber, sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips. In 2017, a large area of key nesting habitat has been logged for timber extraction (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Over 50% of the original grassy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> forest in Tasmania has been cleared (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Selective logging has resulted in the removal of larger trees from the remaining forest patches. Such patches are typically unfenced and exhibit poor regeneration (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Competition for remaining nest-sites with Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> could be a problem along forest edges. Even with protection of remaining habitat (80% private land), maintenance and recovery may be limited by the dependence of breeding on an irregular nectar supply. It also suffers high mortality through collision with windows, vehicles and fences. On the mainland, clearance and degradation of habitat for agriculture, forestry and residential and commercial development has had the biggest impact (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2007). Much of the preferred lowland habitat on the most fertile and productive sites has been cleared or substantially modified (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2003). Drought refuge habitats continue to be cleared and fragmented for coastal developments (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Remnants, including much of what currently exists in the conservation reserve system, have been heavily cut-over and degraded, and this practice is continuing in many areas, including hardwood production forests. This practice is considered to result in poor and unreliable nectar-sources through the reduction of large mature trees. Competition from large nectarivores honeyeaters and the introduced Bumblebee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bombus terrestris </span>may be exacerbated by forest fragmentation. In winter, the species relies heavily on public land that has been exploited for timber, honey and minerals (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Global warming threatens to alter habitat phenology and climatic conditions such that habitat availability may be significantly reduced (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;in litt.</span>&#160;2007). The species is also threatened by disturbance, Psittacine beak and feather disease and illegal bird capture and trade (D. Saunders&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Furthermore, the species seems to be very susceptible to Allee effects, where survival and reproductive success decline with decreasing population density, which might even accelerate the population decline (Crates <em>et al</em>. 2017).","Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) estimate that the current population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining. It is placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;breeds in Tasmania, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>, mostly along the south-eastern coast from St Helen's to Southport with a small breeding population in the north near Deloraine. After breeding, birds disperse throughout Tasmania before migrating north to mainland Australia. In most years, a large portion of the population winters in central Victoria, with a smaller number of birds wintering further afield (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2007). However during periods of extreme drought in central Victoria, Swift Parrots undertake large-scale movements (up to 1,000 km) to drought refuge habitats in wetter coastal areas of New South Wales (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Small flocks are recorded in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory on a regular basis (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). The range in South Australia appears to have contracted, with only irregular recent records of small flocks or individual birds from the south-east of the state. Population size and trends are poorly known.<br/><br/>In 1987-1988, the breeding population was estimated at 5,000 birds, including 1,320 breeding pairs, and in 1995-1996, at 940 breeding pairs (Brereton 1996). Annual surveys across the non-breeding range fluctuate depending on the distribution of the birds across the landscape and flock sizes (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). In 2010 mainland surveys recorded 2,158 birds, including immatures, the highest count for many years (C. Tzaros and D. Ingwersen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2010). Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) estimate that the population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining, however a population viability analysis model predicted that the population will decline by an average of 87% (79-95%) over three generations (12-18 years) (Heinsohn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.<strong> </strong>Management actions completed or underway include regular population surveys in Tasmania and throughout the mainland range, utilising a large network of volunteers (Saunders<em> et al</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (coordinated by the Swift Parrot Recovery Team and the Threatened Bird Network), addition of areas of critical habitat to the conservation reserve system in Victoria, development and refinement of guidelines for forestry in <em>E. globulus</em> and box-ironbark forests (at identified priority sites), development of community awareness programmes and revegetation and habitat rehabilitation.

It is the second most common sciaenid in most of this region. It represents 20% of surveyed sciaenid biomass based on trawl surveys from the RV Fridjoft Nansen. These surveys from 1999-2006 have reported a 37% decline in mixed sciaenid biomass. Since the 1990s, fishing effort, including the switch to large pair-trawling fleets with increasing trawling range in most of the surveyed region, has substantially increased due to previous declines in catch. Given that this species is found primarily from 80 m to 160 m (although can be found to as deep as 350 m), which is mostly below the average trawling depth of 25 to 75 m, it is estimated that there has been less than 30% decline over the past 10 years (since 1999). Given that fishing effort is increasing and this species is heavily targeted in at least two countries within its range, it is listed as Near Threatened based on A2bd.","This species spawns often spawns in estuaries (F. Nunoo pers. comm.).  It is found in muddy, sandy and rocky substrates in deeper shelves from 50 m to 350 m, but is most common between 80 m and 160 m. It feeds on worms, fish and small invertebrates, including shrimps. Age at first maturity and longevity is not-well known, but given the maximum potential size of this species, individuals to 40 cm may live less than five years (N.L. Chao pers. comm.).

The dependence on fish and fishing as a source of food, animal protein, trade income and employment dates back many decades to a century.  Marine fishing started off with the popular dugout canoes propelled with sails, oars and paddles.  Fishing was mainly subsistence and less commercial while fishing with very unsophisticated gear such as hook and line, gill net and beach seine; and covering very short distances and trips.  With the motorisation of artisanal canoes by outboard motors in the late 1950s and early 1960s came expansion of fishing range, use of ice and freezer vessels.  Various sophisticated gears including purse seine and trawls evolved with time in response to the growing industry.  The semi-industrial industry evolved using locally built wooden hulled vessels with inboard engines and later came the imported steel hulled vessels.  Fishermen began to migrate to settle in nations during lean seasons in search of fish stocks as well as vessels from one country fished in the waters of other countries under traditional agreements in the early 1970s.  With the coming into force of exclusive economic zones (EEZ) for various countries, the range of many fleets became limited to that of their nations.  In the late 1990s, the numbers of trawlers almost doubled in most of the nations in response to the profitability of the industry.  However, it was not long before catch rates declined and in response pair trawling commenced around 2005.<br/><br/>Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana and Cameroon have the largest fleets in the West African region.

Negative population trends and habitat fragmentation are projected to continue. The species therefore qualifies as Endangered. <br/><p></p> <p></p>","Historically it has been reported to occur in a wide variety of habitats, including a range of primary and secondary, tropical and subtropical, evergreen and deciduous forest-types, mixed coniferous forest, swamp forest, open woodland, forest edge, bamboo, grasslands, savannas, scrub and farmland edge, from sea-level to at least 2,100 m. Contemporary records are mostly limited to dry deciduous forests, with the highest densities occurring near undisturbed rivers and wetlands (Brickle 2002); access to water and human disturbance have a strong influence on the species's abundance and distribution (Brickle 2002, J. C. Eames <em>in litt.</em> 2004). It has been hypothesized that the species favours open deciduous forest as it may allow large clutches to be laid to coincide with a seasonal flush of fallen fruit (Brickle 2002)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Widespread hunting for meat and feathers, and collection of eggs and chicks, combined with habitat modification and human disturbance, has caused a catastrophic decline throughout much of the species's range. Especially in the species's lowland forest habitat, the rate of snaring has increased tremendously since about 2005. Forest fragmentation has isolated many small populations, increasing their susceptibility to local extinction, but selective logging appears to have no adverse effects on peafowl distribution (Brickle 2002)<strong></strong>. Agricultural intensification, overgrazing and burning are major threats to the species (Sukumal <em>et al.</em> 2015). Other threats may include trade in the male's spectacular train feathers. In 2008, individuals of this species were reportedly being sold illegally for IDR200,000 (at the time around US$22) in the animal markets of Java (ProFauna Indonesia<em> in litt.</em> 2008). The species is regarded as a crop-pest by farmers in China and Thailand (W. Meckvichai <em>in litt.</em> 2004), and is consequently poisoned (Han<em> et al.</em> 2009).

This equates to 15,000-29,999 individuals in total, rounded here to 15,000-30,000 individuals. Nevertheless this remains a coarse estimate and warrants refinement.",Decreasing,"<em>Pavo muticus</em> has a large ancestral range, across which it was once common and widespread  (BirdLife International 2001)<em></em>. In<strong> Myanmar</strong>, surveys in 2003-2005 suggested it was common in the Chindwin basin (Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2007, J. C. Eames <em>in litt. </em>2012),  subsequently designated as the Hukawng Tiger Reserve. Elsewhere in the  lowlands of Kachin state it may have undergone significant declines  during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In <strong>China</strong> it was formerly reported from Zhejang,  Hubei, Sichuan, Guangxi and Guandong provinces, but has declined  significantly, being lost from all of these since the early 20th century  (McGowan and Kirwan 2018). It is now known almost exclusively from  Yunnan province, where it is mainly limited to the tropical forest area  on the banks of the middle and lower reaches of the Lanchan, Nu and Red  Rivers (Han <em>et al.</em> 2009). The population in Yunnan was estimated at 800-1,100 individuals in the early 1990s (Xianji <em>et al. </em>1997). In <strong>Vietnam</strong>, the species was<em>&#160;</em>formerly  widespread virtually throughout, being locally numerous even as recently  as the late 1970s/early 1980s, but numbers have been much reduced by  habitat loss (McGowan <em>et al. </em>1998). The main population is now thought  to lie in the southcentral region, with the Yok Don and Cat Tien  National Parks thought to contain the most important populations.&#160;In <strong>Thailand</strong>, the population appears to be stable or  even increasing in some areas. In Jun District, Phayao Province in  Northern Thailand, a mosaic of farmland and forest habitat in and around a  wildlife sanctuary (Wiang Lor) supports a significant and expanding  Green Peafowl population (P. D. Round <em>in litt. </em>2017). The  population here is thought to be several hundred birds and possibly as  many as 1,000 or more. Local cultural beliefs, alongside a  community-based Green Peafowl conservation project being run out of  Phayao University, may have aided recovery here (P. D. Round <em>in litt. </em>2017).  At Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, western Thailand, encounter  rates compared between 1992 and 2013-2015 showed an increase in numbers  in most of the peripheral areas of the sanctuary whilst numbers in the  core area remained stable, with increased patrols to control hunting  thought to have enabled recovery (Sukumal <em>et al. </em>2017). In <strong>Laos</strong>, it occurs in Xe Pian National Protected Area  and several other proposed or actual conservation units; the country  was considered to still harbour an important population (Thewlis <em>et al. </em>1998),  although numbers have obviously declined dramatically since the early  20th century, as elsewhere (McGowan and Kirwan 2018).<strong> </strong><strong>Cambodia</strong> had been speculated to hold one of the  largest remaining populations of the species, however it is likely  suffering due to wholesale transformation of the landscape (P. D. Round <em>in litt. </em>2017).  In the north, at Siem Pang Wildlife Sanctuary the population was  estimated at around 570 birds (Loveridge <em>et al. </em>2017).  The site is thought to be a national stronghold for the species, with  the highest densities in riverine habitat and further from human  settlements. In the east of the country, the population in Seima  Protection Forest, Mondulkiri region in 2014 was estimated to be about 540 (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2016). It presumably breeds in suitable habitat throughout the Mondulkiri region (Gray <em>et al. </em>2014),  and it was the bird species most frequently recorded by camera traps  set in forest in Phnom Prich WS and Mondulkiri PF (Phan <em>et al</em>. 2010).

Between 2000 and 2009, wetland loss in the western (Daurian) part of the range has been greatly exacerbated by prolonged drought conditions. This drought is part of a climatic cycle, and is predicted to persist until 2015 (O. Gorosko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Breeding birds are also threatened by steppe fires, whilst livestock grazing may cause disturbance and reduce the availability of suitable nesting habitat (Bradter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).

In China, wintering flocks occur outside of existing reserves, and are consequently at risk from hunting, direct disturbance, pollution from pesticide use and further loss of habitat due to agricultural expansion (Higuchi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). At Cholwon, Korea, a switch from spring to autumn ploughing of rice paddies resulted in reduced foraging rates, potentially affecting overwinter survival (Don Lee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007).&#160; Mortality due to agricultural chemicals has been reported and is probably under-estimated.&#160; In Japan, the high proportion of individuals wintering at a single site at Izumi may render the population at greater risk from stochastic events or disease. Izumi is the main poultry region in Japan, and a disease outbreak among cranes could lead to over-reaction and extreme control measures due to economic risks to poultry farmers. The presence of livestock is likely to be detrimental because of disturbance, although it is possible that a limited amount of grazing could be important for maintaining habitat (Bradter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007).

The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It migrates on a narrow front via specific routes (Johnsgard 1983), and may travel vast distances without alighting to rest or feed (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986). The Autumn migration begins in late summer (Meine and Archibald 1996) (August-September), with the species returning in flocks from its wintering areas to breed in March and April (sometimes as late as early-June in the north) (Johnsgard 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). On arrival in the breeding grounds the species remains gregarious for a few weeks, before becoming more territorial and eventually nesting in solitary pairs (although the species may still forage in small groups of c.7 individuals during the breeding season) (Johnsgard 1983). After breeding (from mid-August) (Snow and Perrins 1998) migratory flocks as large as 400 individuals begin to form (Johnsgard 1983), and on arrival in its wintering grounds the species often aggregates into huge flocks of up to several thousands or tens-of-thousands (Johnsgard 1983, Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986). <strong>Habitat </strong>In both its breeding and wintering ranges this species shows a preference for grassland habitats in close proximity to streams, shallow lakes and other wetlands, also frequenting desert areas where water is available (Johnsgard 1983, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996). <em>Breeding</em> In its breeding range the species occurs from sea-level up to 3000 m (Johnsgard 1983, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996), inhabiting grassy steppes of feather grass <em>Stipa</em> and fescue <em>Festuca</em>, and dry areas dominated by wormwood <em>Artemisia</em> (Johnsgard 1983), the essential habitat requirement being access to water (e.g. rivers, streams or wells) for drinking (Johnsgard 1983). It can be found on hilly steppes along wide river valleys (Johnsgard 1983), shrubby steppes and semi-desert (Johnsgard 1983), forest edge habitats (e.g. meadows) (Johnsgard 1983), and occasionally unvegetated alkaline flats, or large expanses of rock or gravel (Johnsgard 1983). It will often forage in damp marshes and swamps (Johnsgard 1983), and is regularly found in cultivated areas (Johnsgard 1983).  <em>Non-breeding</em> In Africa the species inhabits dry <em>Acacia </em>savanna, grassland, grassy river margins (Johnsgard 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and semi-desert (where water is available) (Johnsgard 1983), but in India a wider range of habitat types are used, including marshes, freshwater lakes, rivers (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986), cultivated fields and rice stubble (Johnsgard 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), sandy riverbeds, the flat and open margins of seasonal pans and farm ponds (Johnsgard 1983), and hot desert (if water is readily available) (Johnsgard 1983, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996). It often roosts in shallow water or on sandbars and mudflats surrounded by water (Johnsgard 1983, Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Diet </strong>The diet of this species consists mainly of plant material (Snow and Perrins 1998) (such as grass seeds) (Johnsgard 1983, Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), although lizards and small invertebrates such as large insects (especially beetles) and worms (Johnsgard 1983, Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) are also taken during the summer (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species will forage in cultivated fields (Johnsgard 1983), feeding on ripening cereal crops in its breeding grounds (Johnsgard 1983), peanuts, beans and other crops on migration (Meine and Archibald 1996), and wheat, chickpeas, alfalfa (Johnsgard 1983) and lucerne (Snow and Perrins 1998) in India (Johnsgard 1983, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow scrape (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) (although often no attempt is made to find or construct a cavity) (Johnsgard 1983)on dry ground, lined or surrounded by pebbles and plant materials (eggs may be laid directly onto the ground) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The nest may be placed on gravel (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) in areas partially or entirely free of vegetation (Johnsgard 1983), or in open patches of grass and cultivation, usually less than 1-2 km away from a source of water (Johnsgard 1983, Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986). Nests are rarely positioned closer than 200-300 m apart (Johnsgard 1983).","Habitat loss and degradation from agriculture (e.g. agricultural conversion of steppe grassland (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), intensification of agricultural methods and changes in agricultural practices such as increased spring ploughing) (Meine and Archibald 1996) is the primary threat to this species throughout its range. Other threats include disturbance due to rising human populations (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996), intensive use of pesticides (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996), hunting for sport (along the migration route in Afghanistan and Pakistan) (Meine and Archibald 1996), and shooting and intentional poisoning in some areas where crop damage occurs (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996). Many migratory habitats have also been lost through the building of dams and the drainage of wetlands (Meine and Archibald 1996), and the breeding population in Morocco is threatened by over-grazing and mining (Meine and Archibald 1996).","The global population is estimated to number c.230,000-261,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 9,700-13,300 pairs, which equates to 19,400-26,500 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Bern Convention Appendix II.

The breeding season extends from late April to late July (Jiang Yun-Lei  <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. Clutch size ranges from four to seven eggs, with an incubation period of 11-14 days, followed by a nestling period of 10-13 days (Wang Haitao  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).

However, forestry can result in areas of young trees which are temporarily suitable habitat until dense forest develops.

Hale <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2010, Hale 2010). In Russia, its decline may have occurred because fires, started for agricultural purposes, affected its habitat and prevented breeding. Potentially suitable habitats remaining in Russia (and presumably also North Korea) are threatened by the implementation of the large-scale Tumangan Development Project. Birds at Dagang Forestry, western Jilin suffered a high degree of nest abandonment, which may have been caused by a combination of disturbance by grazing livestock and predation by snakes and rats (Jiang Yun-Lei  <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. European suslik <em>Citellus citellus </em>and Amur Falcon <em>Falco amurensis</em> are also potential nest predators (Jiang Yun-Lei  <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. Human populations are rapidly expanding within the species's range, and activities such as grazing, digging up medicinal plants and picking the fruits of Siberian apricot <em>Armeniaca sibirica</em> have increased, altering vegetation structure and increasing the probability of nest-robbing by fruit-pickers and shepherds (Jiang Yun-Lei  <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>.

In Russia, it was previously locally common in southern Primorye, with a population estimated at several hundred pairs, but had disappeared from its former breeding sites by the early 1970s, and there have been no subsequent records. In the past, it was not uncommon within its small range in North Korea, but there is little recent information. In China, the breeding population at three sites in Jilin province was estimated at 330-430 pairs in 1994, and in the first half of the 20th century it was locally common in Heilongjiang; however, there are very few recent records and it appears to have disappeared or drastically declined at most of its known sites.

It has therefore been uplisted to Vulnerable.","The species breeds on small, shallow fresh, brackish or slightly alkaline waters between 0.5 and 2 m deep and between 1 and 20 ha in area with rich floating, submergent and emergent vegetation (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Konter 2001, Fjeldså 2004). Habitats include small pools, marshes with patches of open water and secluded sections of larger lakes and rivers (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992).&#160;The nest is a platform of aquatic vegetation either floating and anchored to emergent vegetation, built from the lake bottom (where water is shallow) or built on rocks at water level (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992).&#160;In its wintering range, the species frequents coastal inshore waters up to 10-20 m in depth including sheltered bays, lagoons and estuaries (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Ogilvie and Rose 2003, Fjeldså 2004). It may also occur on large lake and river systems south of its breeding range (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Fjeldså 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Its diet consists predominantly of fish and invertebrates such as adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, dragonflies, mayflies, water bugs, damselflies and caddisflies), crustaceans (e.g. brine shrimp, cladocerans, amphipods, decapods, crayfish and crabs), molluscs and worms (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Konter 2001, Fjeldså 2004). Fish and crustaceans are more important components of the diet during the winter when the species is at sea (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992).&#160;This species is fully migratory and travels over land in stages on a broad front, some populations only moving short distances to the nearest ice-free coast (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldså 2004).","<p>The majority of the breeding range of the species lies within areas used for forestry, which is believed to have significantly impacted the area of suitable breeding habitat available to Horned Grebes (Llimona <em>et al. </em>2014). Afforestation can lead to hydrological changes that reduce the availability of invertebrate prey to the grebe, and climate change appears to be having similar impacts through the drying of wetlands leading to overgrowth by plants, especially in the southern part of the range (A. Mischenko&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2017). Dams also impact habitat suitability, however, they are likely to only impact a small minority of the population and may also provide additional habitat in parts of the range. There has also been a loss of habitat to agricultural development and rural development across the range, for example more than ten percent of the overall five percent decrease in wetland area in the Prairies of Canada was due to land being built upon (COSEWIC 2009). Development is likely to also bring disturbance to the birds, which may cause nest abandonment (Stedman 2018). Despite this, the species' range remains very large and, as such, these threats are likely to only affect a small fraction of the population. Many freshwater sites throughout the breeding range have become eutrophied through agricultural run-off, which is thought to degrade the nutritional quality of the prey base and nutrient status of the water has been related to breeding success in Scotland (Summers <em>et al</em>. 2011). The introduction of large fish, such as the Rainbow Trout&#160;<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>, to many inland water bodies is likely to result in resource competition for invertebrate and small fish prey (HELCOM 2013). It is not clear that trout are actually affecting a majority of the global population, as no impact detected in a study in Scotland (Summers <em>et al.</em> 2011) which indicated that pike was a more significant source of mortality.</p><p>Horned Grebes are commonly caught and accidentally drowned in fishing nets (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992), with bycatch in nearshore gill-nets&#160; a potential significant source of mortality in much of the range as they appear highly susceptible to capture (more so than seaduck when accoutning for abundance) (Zydelis <em>et al. </em>2013). The species is also particularly vulnerable to oil spills in the marine environment during the winter (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Ogilvie and Rose 2003, Fjeldså 2004, COSEWIC 2009).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is an intra-African migrant, making nomadic or partially migratory movements of several hundred kilometres to breed during the rains (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Populations north of the equator migrate northwards and those south of the equator migrate southwards (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), both groups returning towards the equator at the end of the breeding season (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982). Some populations (e.g. in southern Africa) may also be sedentary (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The species starts to breed during or shortly after the rains, although in flooded areas it also breeds during the dry season, usually nesting in large mixed-species colonies of 50-2,000 pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). It is a very gregarious species, often flying more than 30 km away from the colony to feed (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The species also roosts nightly in large numbers at breeding sites, on islets in rivers or flood-lands, on trees near dams, or in villages (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species mainly inhabits the margins of inland freshwater wetlands, sewage works (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), saltpans (Martin and Randall 1987), farm dams (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005), rivers in open forest (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982), grasslands, and cultivated fields, as well as coastal lagoons, intertidal areas, offshore islands (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and mangroves (Langrand 1990) (especially in the dry season) (Hancock <em>et al</em>. 1992). It may also occur in more human environments such as farmyards, abattoirs and refuse dumps on the outskirts of towns (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists largely of insects including grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, and aquatic beetles, although it will also take crustaceans, worms, molluscs, fish, frogs, lizards, small mammals, the eggs of Great White Pelican <em>Pelecanus onocrotalus</em> and crocodiles, nestling Cape Cormorants <em>Phalacrocorax capensis</em>, carrion, offal and seeds (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Hancock <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a large platform of sticks and branches built in trees or bushes, or placed on the ground on rocky islands (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","The population on Aldabra Island has declined due to hunting and disturbance by temporary workers (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).

It has therefore been uplisted to Vulnerable. The cause(s) of declines are unknown, but are likely multi-faceted and further research is needed to inform conservation actions.</p>","This species is marine and pelagic, often occurring in areas of convergence or upwelling or over continental shelves, rarely coming near land except at colonies. During the breeding season, birds from the western Atlantic are highly pelagic in their foraging habits, travelling to deep (median &gt;1,950 m) and relatively unproductive waters (chlorophyll a concentrations &lt;0.5 mg/m3) over and beyond continental slopes lying, on average, 400 to 830 km from colonies (Pollet <em>et al.</em> 2014, Hedd <em>et al</em>. 2018). Its diet comprises mainly of small fish, squid, planktonic crustaceans and offal which it catches on the wing by dipping, skimming or snatching from the surface. It sometimes follows marine mammals feeding on leftovers or faeces. Its breeding season is variable depending on locality, forming colonies on offshore islands on high ground or slopes, usually among rocks but also in soft soil between trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","<p>Brown Rats&#160;<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>&#160;and House Rats&#160;<em>R. rattus</em>, are considered to exert a considerable predation pressure on the species where they establish on breeding islands, and may be a key determinant of the present breeding distribution, possibly along with cats. Cats&#160;<em>Felis catus</em>&#160;predate large numbers of adult and fledgling Leach's Storm-petrels where present, and may have been responsible for the extirpation of the species from a number of formerly occupied sites. Foxes caused the extirpation of the species from numerous islands in Alaska following their introduction, with their eradication on a number of islands leading to subsequent recolonization by Leach’s Storm-petrel. Mice&#160;<em>Mus musculus&#160;</em>are also suspected to be impacting the species through nest predation, but the effects are unclear.<br/><br/>Leach’s Storm-petrel&#160;<em>Hydrobates leucorhous&#160;</em>experiences high levels of predation from native predators. In 1997, Herring Gulls <em>Larus argentatus&#160;</em>killed almost 49,000 adult petrels during the breeding season on Great Island, Newfoundland, which at the time had a breeding colony of around 270,000 pairs (Stenhouse <em>et al.</em> 2000). Great Skuas <em>Catharacta skua</em>&#160;predate Leach’s Storm-petrels, with around 21,000 individuals killed each year in the St. Kilda colony; however, these primarily represent non-breeding birds that had immigrated from other, larger colonies, hence this is thought to have a relatively small impact on the population (Stead 2010). Great <em>Larus marinus&#160;</em>and Lesser Black-backed Gulls <em>L. fuscus&#160;</em>are also known to predate relatively large numbers of adult Leach's Storm-petrel (Stenhouse <em>et al.</em> 2000), though the extent to which this drives declines is uncertain.</p>  <p>Research activities have been shown to cause considerable disturbance to Leach’s Storm-petrel and represent a cause of reduced reproductive success. In a study by Blackmer (2004), it was found that weekly investigator disturbance halved the hatching success of Leach’s Storm-petrel nests, and daily disturbance caused a 56% reduction. Of all the reproductive failures in this study, egg desertion accounted for 91% and only occurred in pairs in the disturbed treatment groups.</p>  Foraging ranges during the breeding season for five out of seven western Atlantic colonies overlapped with offshore oil and gas operations; three of these colonies have declined in recent decades (Hedd <em>et al.</em> 2018). Attraction to lights and flares and subsequent collisions with oil rigs poses a risk (Hedd <em>et al. </em>2018). Large oil spills represent a relatively unlikely but potentially very severe threat, although due to this bird’s large range, it would be likely to affect only a small portion of the population. Small spills of hydrocarbons and synthetic drilling fluids are relatively common (CNLOPB 2012, McCrary <em>et al.</em> 2003) and contribute to chronic oil pollution in the sea (National Research Council 1985).","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt;20,000,000 individuals. &#160;Based on the compilation of available data the current population comprises 6.7-8.3 million breeding pairs; 40-48% of these breed in the Atlantic basin and 52-60% in the Pacific. Throughout the western Atlantic (&gt;90% of basin total), populations are declining, including at Baccalieu Island, Newfoundland, Canada, home to the largest colony. The population at Baccalieu Island, estimated at 3.3 million breeding pairs in 1984 (Sklepkovych and Montevecchi 1989), had declined to 2.02 million pairs by 2013 (Environment Canada <em>unpublished data</em>), and the former second and third regionally largest colonies have declined by &gt;50% since the late 1990s (Wilhelm <em>et al. </em>2015, Environment Canada <em>unpublished data</em>). In the eastern Atlantic, the population at St. Kilda is also declining, this being the largest colony in the UK and Ireland (Newson <em>et al.</em> 2008). &#160;Population trends in the Pacific are less well known. In Alaska, where Leach’s&#160;<em>Hydrobates leucorhous</em>&#160;and Fork-tailed Storm-petrels <em>H. furactus</em> are largely combined for monitoring purposes, population trends are stable or increasing (Slater and Byrd 2009, Dragoo <em>et al</em>. 2016), the large population at Daikoku Island, Japan may have declined since 1982, while trends of western North American and Russian populations are unknown. Despite these knowledge gaps, compiling available data collected between 1977 and 2016, representing 75-80% of the global population (including Europe, eastern North America, and Japan), points to a decline of ≥30% over three generations (39 years, based on a generation length estimated by BirdLife to be 13 years).<br/><br/>Definitive information on Leach’s Storm-petrel population decline comes mainly from colonies within the Atlantic basin. &#160;Recent genetics research indicates that while there is no genetic structure among Atlantic colonies, populations within the Atlantic and the Pacific are genetically distinct (Bicknell <em>et al.</em> 2012). &#160;Evidence of movement of pre-breeding birds among colonies within the Atlantic, led to the conclusion that North Atlantic birds may be operating as a metapopulation and that management of this species may be best viewed at an oceanic scale (Bicknell <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014).",Decreasing,"This species has an extensive global range. Breeding colonies are largely confined to the northern hemisphere, from the South Kuril Islands (<strong>Japan</strong>) round to Baja California (<strong>Mexico</strong>) including the Aleutian Islands, Alaska (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>) and <strong>Canada </strong>in the Pacific, and in the north-east North America, <strong>Iceland</strong>, northern <strong>United Kingdom</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong> in the Atlantic. Small numbers also breed off South Africa (Underhill <em>et al.</em> 2002).

They use a wide range of nesting habitats, including bare ground, shingle, grassland, scrub, under trees and in derelict buildings (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The nest is a slight hollow in the ground that is usually positioned in the shelter of rocks or vegetation but may also be in the open (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Large nesting aggregations form where safe nesting sites are at a premium (Waltho and Coulson 2015).</p><p>These species typically moults on shallow marine or sheltered coastal waters free from disturbance (Kear 2005; Waltho and Coulson 2015). It winters on shallow coasts (usually &lt;10m depth), bays and estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Waltho and Coulson 2015), especially where there are high abundances of benthic molluscs,&#160;particularly <em>Mytilus edulis</em> (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015). It may also occur inland on freshwater lakes when on passage and during the winter (rarely) (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Its diet consists predominantly of benthic molluscs,&#160;especially <em>Mytilus edulis</em>, although a wide range of crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and isopods), echinoderms, other marine invertebrates and fish may also be taken (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015). During the breeding season incubating females in the Arctic &#160;are reported to feed on &#160;algae, berries and the seeds and leaves of surrounding tundra plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), while in temperate regions they do not&#160;feed, which leads to the temporary breakdown of their digestive system (Waltho and Coulson 2015, Laursen and Møller 2016), Northern populations of this species are migratory (&gt;1000km), but southern populations are largely sedentary (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Migratory nature is largely a response to coastal sea ice (Waltho and Coulson 2015).<br/></p><p></p>","<p>The critical factor for the long-term survival of the species appears to be the survival rate of young ducklings (Waltho and Coulson 2015), but it is not clear which factors are causing the low duckling survival. Past mass mortality in ducklings has been caused by viral infections (1996, 1999) (Hollmén 2002), and the impact of this is likely aggravated by low availability and low nutritional quality of food supplies which is associated with poor body condition in females at the onset of the breeding season (Desholm <em>et al</em>. 2003). Avian cholera appears to be a potentially significant threat with mass mortality events noted at several colonies in Denmark and in Canada (Kats 2007, Descamps <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tjørnløv <em>et al.</em> 2013), and according to Descamps <em>et al.</em>’s (2012) model, only a few recurrent outbreaks would be sufficient to cause colony extinction within a relatively short time. Other diseases may also impact populations, e.g. Wellfleet Bay Virus has caused heavy mortality in Massachusetts, US (Ballard <em>et al.</em> 2012) but high parasite loads are considered to be a symptom of other detrimental impacts rather than a primary driver of decline (Kats 2007).</p>  <p>Conflict with the shellfish aquaculture industry can have detrimental effects on certain populations (Kear 2005, Ens 2006). Over-harvesting of benthic molluscs has led to mass starvation events in the past, particularly where secondary prey resources are targeted, as with intensive fishing of <em>Spisula</em> clams during a period of low mussel stocks prior to a mass mortality event in 1999-2000 in the Dutch Wadden Sea and southern North Sea (Camphuysen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Ens 2006, Kats 2007). The species is also impacted by the extensive use of gillnets, and commonly becomes entangled and drowned in monofilament nets, and significant mortality may occur where fishing effort overlaps with Eider aggregations (Kear 2005, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Levels of hunting are high within several countries within the range, and have been considered unsustainable in Russia (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006), Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Greenland (where annual bags exceeded 80,000 in the late 1990s) (Merkel 2004). New restrictions introduced in 2004 appear to have enabled populations to recover considerably (Merkel 2010). In North America, the harvest may still exceed sustainable levels in certain areas (Kear 2005).&#160; Populations in the high Arctic are subject to shooting by indigenous peoples for food, especially in spring (Byers and Dickson 2001, Kear 2005), but this subsistence hunting is likely to be sustainable at current levels (Byers and Dickson 2001). An associated threat is that of lethal and sub-lethal lead exposure through ingestion of lead shot by adult birds, with 23% of females dying of emancipation after incubation were diagnosed with severe or sub-clinical lead poisoning (Hollmén 2002), and 22% of birds collected through hunting in Greenland over three years carried embedded shot pellets (Falk <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>The species is vulnerable to chronic coastal oil pollution and to major oil spills especially in areas where large moulting and wintering concentrations occur (Kear 2005, Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015, Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2017). While one major incident has the potential to be disastrous, levels of chronic oil-related mortality appears relatively stable in the southern North Sea and Wadden Sea, at between 4-12% of estimated winter mortality (Camphuysen <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>  <p>Disturbance from the development of mineral resources along the coast (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006) and from local shore-based activities such as angling and dog walking increases the likelihood of predation on young (Keller 1991). Other recreational activities such as boat tours (Burnham <em>et al.</em> 2012), as well as scientific research (Bolduc and Guillemette 2003) are also likely to reduce productivity at certain locations (Keller 1991). In winter, unregulated tourism and shipping also cause disturbance to the species, and may prevent access to favoured feeding grounds (Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>Additional threats include predation of breeding females in Europe by the increased population of White-tailed Eagle <em>Haliaeetus albicilla</em> and nest predation by introduced mink <em>Mustela vison</em> (Kats 2007, Ekroos <em>et al.</em> 2012) and in the Americas by introduced foxes <em>Vulpes</em> spp. (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2015). Increasing incidence of nesting in tight association with gull colonies and in less exposed sites, may reflect antipredator responses.</p>  <p>The species may also be sensitive to the effects of climate change, though assessing the impacts on population dynamics is problematic as negative effects (e.g. lower growth in prey leading to reduced food availability [Carboneras <em>et al.</em> 2012]) are confounded by potential positive impacts deriving from earlier arrival on breeding grounds improving breeding success in some areas (D’Alba <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>  Mussel quality, and subsequent eider breeding condition, increases with higher nutrient content of coastal waters (Laursen and Møller 2014) so recent reductions in the level of eutrophication of near-shore waters may have contributed to lower food availability.&#160; Thiamine deficiency has been linked to a lethal paralytic syndrome that has caused mass mortality of Eider ducklings. Unlike Herring Gulls <em>Larus argentatus</em>, Common Eider females will lay eggs even below the critical threshold of thiamine, with resultant rapid mortality in hatchlings (Balk <em>et al.</em> 2009). The extent to which this impacts the population is unknown, and is unlikely to account for the strongly skewed sex ratio observed in the species (Lehikoinen <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, the causes of lethal thiamine deficiency need further investigation as there may be a widespread pollutant present that is currently unidentified. Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, with potential reverberations up the trophic chain. In the Baltic, the impact is thought to be sufficiently low to not cause declines (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011).<p></p>","<p>The global population is estimated to number c. 3,300,000-4,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2012), which equates to 1,580,000-1,910,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 791,000-955,000 pairs.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The breeding range of this species is widely distributed around the mid- to high-latitude coasts of the northern hemisphere, particularly at the higher latitudes. It has a Holarctic distribution, being present in both Eurasia and North America. However, its distribution is not continuous across the Holarctic. There are distinct and persistent gaps in both the central parts of the Russian Arctic and the Canadian Arctic. The distributional gap in Russia (54° longitude) is considerably wider than that in Canada (6° longitude). These gaps can be attributed to the presence of ice all year round at these locations, especially landfast sea ice. At the highest latitudes, the presence of breeding birds is largely limited by the distribution of ice-free conditions during June.</p><p>In winter, the range is more compressed, with migratory northern populations largely wintering within the range of the southerly sedentary populations (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The southern limits of regular wintering ranges are southern Alaska (USA) at 51°N, New Jersey (USA) at 41°N, W France at 44°N and Kuril Islands (Russia) at 50°N (Waltho and Coulson 2015).</p><p>Globally there are six widely recognised subspecies (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015), with four in Eurasia: European (<em>S. mollissima mollissima</em>), Faroes (<em>S. m. faeroeensis</em>), Northern (<em>S. m. borealis</em>) and Pacific (<em>S. mollissima v-nigrum</em>).

For these reasons it is listed as Endangered.<p></p>,"<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is not strictly migratory and the majority of birds remain within 500 km of their breeding site year round (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Klages 1994)<strong></strong>, some (mainly adult males) continuing to use the breeding grounds as roosting sites throughout the non-breeding season (Nelson 2005)<strong></strong>. However, some adults disperse up to 3300 km from the breeding colonies, moving along the African coast for about 3 months during the non-breeding season (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nelson 2005)<strong></strong>. Juveniles used to disperse northwards in April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Nelson 2005)<strong></strong>, travelling up to 4,000 km towards the equator (Nelson 2005), returning to breed around four years of age (Crawford 1999). Breeding occurs between September and April in large colonies of &gt;10,000 pairs and in smaller groups (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2007). Large foraging aggregations occur around trawling vessels (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>Individuals can travel as much as 450 km in a day in search of food (Mullers 2009)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Habitat </strong>This species is strictly marine. <em>Breeding </em>It prefers to nests on flat or gently sloping open ground on offshore islands<strong></strong>, but will also use island cliffs as well as man-made structures such as guano platforms (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>It most often forages within 120 km of the shore (Adams and Navarro 2005)<strong></strong>, particularly frequenting areas where purse-seine netting occurs (Nelson 2005). It occasionally wanders further offshore over the continental shelf (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong> where it benefits from the discards of deep-water stern trawlers (Nelson 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Diet </strong>It feeds mainly on shoaling pelagic fish such as anchovy <em>Engraulis capensis</em>, sardine <em>Sardinops sagax</em> or saury <em>Scomberesox saurus</em>, as well as offal discarded by fishing boats including demersal fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. In South Africa, fluctuations in the contribution of <em>E. capensis</em> and <em>S. sagax</em> in the diet match the changing abundance of the species (Crawford and Dyer 1995, Crawford <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>.<strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>The nest consists of a mound with a cup-shaped depression in its centre (Nelson 2005)<strong></strong>. It is made from guano, vegetation and other matter that can be scraped together (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Where no such material is available, eggs are laid on bare ground (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>.  . <p></p>","Food shortage, following the collapse of the Namibian sardine fishery and an eastward displacement of epipelagic fish off South Africa, has been the main cause of declines (Crawford&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, 2014, 2015). In Namibia, anchovies only temporarily and partially replace sardines in the diet when the latter becomes scarce (Crawford&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In both Namibia and South Africa, the numbers of Cape Gannets breeding were significantly related to the biomass of epipelagic fish prey (Crawford&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Competition with purse-seine fisheries targeting small pelagic fish has been demonstrated in South Africa, with a negative impact on foraging success, adult body condition and chick growth rates (Okes<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009, Cohen<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014, Grémillet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), but little evidence for impacts on the local population size or a decrease in adult survival rate (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, this may be in part due to an increased reliance on fisheries discards (Tew-Kai <em>et al. </em>2013), which may impair reproductive performance (Grémillet<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2008) and increase the risk of bycatch mortality previously noted as a threat to the species (Du Toit&#160;<em>et al. </em>2002, Peterson <em>et al. </em>2008).<br/>Storms can have significant impacts on breeding success, with the entire population considered at risk from coastal flooding (Spatz <em>et al. </em>2017) and some colonies at risk of completely disappearing in the face of rising sea levels and increased storm frequency and severity. The effects from storms may be exacerbated by previous guano collection. Previously, guano mining removed suitable habitat, disturbed breeding birds and shortened the breeding season at some sites, but commercial exploitation largely ceased by the 1990s. Direct chick predation by Cape Fur Seal <em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em>&#160;has recurred at several colonies, threatening the viability of that at Malgas Island, while at least two colonies (Hollam's Bird Island and Lambert's Bay in 2005/06) have been physically displaced by fur seals (Makhado <em>et al. </em>2006, Crawford <em>et al. </em>2007). Additional native predators that cause chick mortality and may be a concern include Kelp Gull <em>Larus dominicanus</em>&#160;and Great White Pelican <em>Pelecanus onocrotalus</em>&#160;(Du Toit <em>et al. </em>2002, Mullers 2009).<br/>Oil spills are thought to be an ongoing minor threat identified in Namibia from vessels that process fish at sea and also on-shore facilities discharging fish oil (Du Toit and Bartlett 2001), but previous large incidents have impacted relatively large numbers of birds (e.g. c.<em></em>5,000 individuals oiled during an incident in 1993). Historically, large numbers (especially juveniles) were collected for food or for use as bait in Cape Rock Lobster <em>Jasus lalandii</em> traps (Du Toit <em>et al. </em>2002).","The most recent population estimate is made up of 10,500 pairs at Ichaboae Island, 2,200 pairs on Mercury Island and 380 pairs on Possession Island, all in 2010 (Kemper 2015). 81,000 pairs were estimated at Bird Island (Algoa Bay), 21,000 pairs at Malgas Island and 8,000 pairs at Bird Island (Lambert’s Bay) in 2015 (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2015 updated by R. Crawford <em>in litt.</em> 2016). This gives a global total of 123,080 pairs, which equates to 246,160 mature individuals, rounded here to 246,000.",Decreasing,"<em>Morus capensis</em> breeds at six islands: Bird (Lambert's Bay), Malgas and Bird (Algoa Bay), <strong>South Africa</strong>, and Mercury, Ichaboe and Possession, <strong>Namibia</strong>. Historically, it bred on four more islands (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 1983)<strong></strong>. Outside the breeding season, adults may disperse up to c.1,000 km from colonies, whereas juvenile birds may move &gt;2,000 km (Klages 1994). Birds range east to KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique and as vagrants to Tanzania (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 1983, Klages 1994). On the west coast of Africa, birds formerly moved north as far as Nigeria, and as vagrants to Western Sahara (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 1983). However, there are few recent records of birds moving north of southern Angola, suggesting possible change in dispersal pattern (Oatley <em>et al.</em> 1992, Klages 1994). The species usually remains over the continental shelf, often within 100 km of land (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;Limited exchange occurs between breeding localities (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 1983).&#160;There has been a recent shift in the breeding distribution of the species around the southern African coast from the northwest to the southeast, which has matched a shift in the distribution of epipelagic forage fish, the Cape Gannet’s main prey, that may have been environmentally driven (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2015).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>In South Africa, Lambert's Bay and Bird Island are nature reserves and Malgas Island is within West Coast National Park. In Namibia, the three breeding islands are administered by the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources and are part of the Namibian Islands’ Marine Protected Area. All six islands have been identified as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) (Barnes 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Oiled birds are rehabilitated with success in South Africa, and the species is protected by law in both countries.&#160;Bycatch in trawl fisheries, through collisions with warp cables is being addressed through the use of bird scaring lines in South Africa and more recently in Namibia, although bycatch in the trawl net is more difficult to mitigate due to the birds’ plunge-diving behaviour (Maree <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Carry out surveys to obtain an up-to-date population estimate. Conduct regular surveys to monitor population trends. Identify key foraging hotspots of both breeding and non-breeding gannets from all colonies, in order to protect these in future.

Juveniles tend to disperse over larger distances, with adults and immatures tending to occur and forage in different areas (Kemper <em>et al. </em>2007). They are gregarious at colonies, although forage singly or in loose groups of up to 15 birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Johnsgard 1993). Breeding activity occurs year round but is concentrated between May and October in the southern and central part of its range, and between November and April in the northern extension of its range (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 1999, MFMR <em>unpubl. data</em>). &#160;<strong>Habitat &#160;</strong>The distribution of this species broadly reflects that of kelp <em>Ecklonia maxima</em> beds and they are rarely found more than 10 km from shore (Cooper 1981). They do not use estuaries or inland waters (Johnsgard 1993). &#160;<em>Breeding</em>&#160; They breed on sea-cliffs and rocky offshore islands (Nelson 2005), sometimes making use of walls or artificial platforms in close proximity to the sea (Cooper 1981, Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2012). Their large size makes it difficult to take off, and this may influence and limit their choice of habitat (Nelson 2005). &#160;<strong>Diet &#160;</strong>The species has a varied diet including fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (Williams and Burger 1978, Cooper 1985, Ludynia <em>et al. </em>2010). Through much of their range they prefer to forage on the sea floor - especially among kelp beds at depths of 5 -15m - and prey mainly on klipfish (Clinidae) and blennies (Blenniidae) associated with the benthic habitat (Williams and Burger 1978). In the northern part of the range, where the largest populations occur, they forage away from the kelp beds and the majority of their diet consists of Bearded Goby <em>Sufflogobius bibarbatus</em> typically foraged around 30-40 m depth (Williams and Burger 1978, Cooper 1981, Ludynia <em>et al. </em>2010). In the South African part of the range, commercially fished Cape Rock Lobster <em>Jasus lalandi </em>forms an important component of their diet (Cooper 1985, Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2016). &#160;<strong>Breeding site &#160;</strong>Nests are built on exposed rocks, walls or artificial platforms in close proximity to the sea (Cooper 1981). The nest is very large (up to 6 kg) (Nelson 2005) and is constructed mainly from seaweed species with some sticks and feathers incorporated (Nelson 2005). A clutch consists of one to three eggs, rarely four (R. Jones<em> </em><em>pers. comm.</em> to R.B. Sherley <em>et al. in litt.&#160;</em>2016), with a mean of two (Cooper 1987), but nests are often lost to rough seas (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2012). The young leave the nest before they are able to fly properly, and so are particularly vulnerable to predation and disturbance at this stage. Age at first breeding is two to three years and average longevity of breeders is estimated at six years (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2001).<strong> </strong></p><p></p>","<p>Changes in food availability as a result of commercial fishing is a major threat facing this species. Decreased abundance of Bearded Goby <em>Taenioides jacksoni</em> off the coast of Namibia in 1994 led to population crashes at two major colonies (Mercury and Ichaboe Islands) and extreme food scarcity continues to drive declines (du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002). Distributional shifts of Cape Rock Lobster <em>Jasus lalandii</em> as a result of lobster fishing caused decreases of larger Bank Cormorant colonies in northern South Africa and increases in the south (Crawford<em> et al. </em>2008) and continued fishing of this major food source may be contributing to ongoing declines on a national level (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2016). A further impact of the lobster fishery is incidental bycatch of birds in lobster traps (Cooper 1985).</p><p>The species suffers from habitat competition (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 1999) and predation (du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002) by Cape Fur Seals <em>Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus</em>. In the past, seals at Mercury Island displaced 14% of the global population of Bank Cormorants. The island is now home to 33% of the global population, after seals have been eliminated (du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002). Kelp Gulls <em>Larus dominicanus</em> and Great White Pelicans <em>Pelecanus onocrotalus</em> also depredate cormorant nests (Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2007). The observation of pelicans in locations where they were previously unrecorded suggest that predation pressures may be intensifying (de Ponte Machado 2007).</p><p>Elevated temperatures and increased frequency and amplitude of storms due to climate change, would have a strong impact on future breeding success of Bank Cormorants. Recent nest failures at Robben Island were related to wave heights and air temperature, with reduced chick survival in years when major storm events coincided with the breeding season (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2012). 73% of the species is classified at risk of exposure to coastal flooding (Crawford 2015).</p><p>The species is sensitive to human disturbance when breeding and will abandon nests if approached, leaving the contents vulnerable to predation (Cooper 1987). Between 1978 and 1997, human disturbance resulted in the loss of four colonies, and reductions in the populations at six others (du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002). Guano mining has contributed to disturbance and habitat loss in the past (Ichaboe Island, 2000) and mining activities are likely to resume in the future (du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002). Activities related to tourism (sea-kayaking, scuba-diving), organised sport (surf-ski races) and research activities (pellet collection, breeding surveys) pose a threat to the species in parts of its range (du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002). Commercial development in coastal areas may cause habitat loss through harbour developments, causeways and dredging (du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002). Although artificial structures, e.g. harbour walls, may provide additional nesting sites, these may represent lower-quality breeding habitat (du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002, Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p><p>Past oil spills (e.g. Apollo Sea, 1994 and Treasure, 2000) severely affected the species. The Treasure oil spill significantly decimated the population (Crawford<em> et al</em>. 2000, du Toit <em>et al</em>. 2002), but numbers subsequently recovered (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2012). The impacts of previous spills may still be causing reduced reproductive success in affected individuals, and ongoing chronic pollution is known to be impacting other species in the region (African Penguin <em>Spheniscus demersus</em>) (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2000).</p><p>                    </p><p>Avian Cholera has severely affected other cormorant species and the disease is present on islands with breeding colonies of Bank Cormorants. Yet, only a few deaths related to outbreaks have been recorded and the episodes seem to be predominantly single-species mortality events impacting Cape Cormorants <em>Phalacrocorax capensis</em> (Waller and Underhill 2007).</p><p></p>","The total breeding population was estimated at 2,500 pairs (5,000 mature individuals) in 2015. This roughly equates to 7,500 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Phalacrocorax neglectus</em> is known to breed at 45 localities between Hollambird Island, <strong>Namibia</strong>, and Quoin Rock, <strong>South Africa</strong>. Birds in breeding plumage have been sighted as far north as Swakopmund but breeding in this area is yet to be confirmed (M. Boorman <em>pers. comm.</em> to R. B. Sherley <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Approximately 80-90% of the breeding population is located on Mercury (2,019 pairs) and Ichaboe Islands (196 pairs), Namibia (Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ludynia <em>et al. </em>2010, Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources [MFMR] unpubl. data). The non-breeding range extends from just south of Hoanibmond (Hoanib River Mouth) south to Die Walle. Several island populations in the west and north Cape Province have declined in recent years and seven former breeding localities have been vacated (Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1997). The total number of breeding pairs fell from 7,600 in 1978-1980 to 5,750 by 1990 and to 2,800 by 2006 (Kemper<em> et al. </em>2007). Between 1993 and 1998, the Namibian breeding population is estimated to have declined by 68%, mainly due to a population collapse on Ichaboe Island after 1994-1995, mainly thought to result from food shortage, but other factors, e.g. predation and displacement by seals may also be a factor (Ludynia <em>et al.</em> 2010). Numbers on Ichaboe have since continued to decline, and although numbers have increased on Mercury Island and are currently stable (Ludynia <em>et al. </em>2010); the total Namibian population in 2006 was 39% less than in 1993 (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p><p>&#160;&#160;</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/> In South Africa, it is protected by law and the terrestrial areas of the major islands where it breeds are national parks, nature reserves or otherwise protected. However, some of the smaller breeding rocks are not protected. Only 11 of the 45 (24%) extant breeding colonies have nature reserve status (Du Toit <em>et al.</em> 2002). The colonies around Saldanha Bay, at Robben Island and at Stony Point are surrounded by at-sea areas of spatial protection, but all are smaller than the foraging range believed to be used by breeding adults (Ludynia <em>et al. </em>2010, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Use colour-banding and biologging to better understand the species movements (Du Toit <em>et al.</em> 2002, Ludynia <em>et al</em>. 2010). Develop and implement a sustainable fisheries plan for the Benguela Upwelling Region to avoid over-depletion of fish and lobster stocks (Du Toit <em>et al.</em> 2002), including a potential ban on lobster fisheries within key areas to reduce the risk of entanglement of benthic diving birds in the traps and competition for decreasing lobster resources (Ludynia <em>et al. </em>2010, Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2016). Take measures against the illegal cleaning of oil tanks at sea, which causes significant oil spills. Develop a contingency plan for major oil spills off the coast of south-western Africa (Du Toit <em>et al.</em> 2002). Improve the legal protection of Namibian offshore breeding sites (Du Toit <em>et al.</em> 2002). Increase public awareness of the conservation problems facing this species (Du Toit <em>et al.</em> 2002).

Rats, rabbits and cats were eradicated in 2014 as part of the Macquarie Island Pest Eradication Project (Parks and Wildlife Service 2014).<br/><br/>Fishing around sub-Antarctic islands may also adversely affect the species, however during the breeding season the species forages in waters near Macquarie Island and in the Exclusive Economic Zone where fishing is strictly regulated (S. Garnett <em>in litt.</em> 2011). The only operating fishery in the waters around Macquarie Island is a Patagonian Toothfish <em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em> longline fishery which is highly regulated and for which no penguin bycatch has been reported (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017, Daley <em>et al.</em> 2007,&#160;Australian Fisheries Management Authority 2018). There is a potential interaction with other fisheries outside of the breeding season when the species disperses, however the population is assessed as stable and Trathan <em>et al.</em> (2015) assigned the threat level from both bycatch and fisheries competition as zero.<p></p>","The species was heavily exploited in the 19th century, but has recovered and, in 1984-1985, an estimated 850,000 pairs were breeding on Macquarie, with an earlier count of over 1,000 pairs on Bishop and Clerk (Garnett and Crowley 2000). The population is believed to be stable.",Stable,"This species&#160;is confined to Macquarie Island and nearby Bishop and Clerk Islands, <strong>Australia</strong>. However, small numbers of similar-looking birds appear at other sub-Antarctic islands (such as South Georgia and Kerguelen Island [Duriez and Delord 2012]), indicating that it may breed elsewhere.&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong></p><p>In Australia the species has been evaluated as Near Threatened.

It is therefore precautionarily classified as Near Threatened as it almost meets the requirements for listing as threatened under criteria A2abe+3be+4abe. Further data are required from across its range to quantify the trend.,"This marine species can be found over both pelagic and inshore waters. It feeds mainly on fish and squid which it catches by surface-seizing and shallow plunges. It often associates with other seabirds and will follow fishing boats. Breeding begins in March in colonies on offshore islands, occupying burrows on forested hills. It undergoes transequatorial migration (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1992)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","<p>Introduced mammals poses the greatest threat to the population, with cats <em>Felis catus</em> and rats <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> and <em>R. rattus</em> being present throughout the species’s range. Rats have invaded at least three of the Japanese breeding islands, with current impacts largely unknown, but likely to affect fledgling success and egg predation (Lee 2010). The shearwaters appear to suffer significant impacts from rats on Mikura-Jima, which is populated by c.300 people and is popular with tourists, thus making an eradication programme problematic and the subsequent reintroduction of rats more likely (Oka <em>et al.</em> 2002, J. Croxall <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Feral cats may also be inflicting increasing mortality on the Mikura-Jima population through predation on chicks, young birds and adults (N. Oka <em>per</em> M. Sato <em>in litt.</em> 2012, S. Uematsu <em>in</em> <em>litt</em>. 2012). Efforts are being taken to capture and neuter feral cats, however due to pressure from the public, cats are hard to eliminate.</p>  <p>Currently, climate change is affecting foraging distribution and hence energetic budgets of adults. It is further predicted that whole colonies may be affected in the future as prey populations shift distribution in response to climate change.</p>  <p>In addition to these threats, the species is also susceptible to fisheries bycatch (Birds Korea 2010, J. Croxall <em>in litt</em>. 2011), but the impact has not been quantified.</p>  Research suggests the Fukushima nuclear accident may have had negative impacts on birds breeding on Mikura Island, with reduced vitamin A levels detected in chicks following the release of radioactive material (Uematsu <em>et al</em>. 2014). The researchers suggest that additional negative impacts may be expected in the population in the future.","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number  c.3,000,000 individuals, while national population estimates include: c.100-10,000 breeding pairs, c.50-1,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in China; c.100,000-1,000,000 breeding pairs, c.10,000 individuals on migration and c.10,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is found in the western Pacific, breeding on the coast and on offshore islands of <strong>Japan</strong>, <strong>Russia</strong>, and on islands off the coasts of <strong>China,</strong> <strong>North Korea </strong>and<strong> South Korea</strong>.

The global population has been estimated to number  c. 3,000,000 individuals (Brooke 2004). In Japan, where the majority of the species’s world population breeds, there are 11 islands that are each thought to be inhabited by more than 10,000 breeding pairs (Oka 2004). A recent survey on the island of Nakanokamishima estimated the population at 5,566 individuals and 2,783 nests (Yamamoto <em>et al</em>. 2015).

The population is undergoing a continuing decline owing to hunting, nesting disturbance and the modification and burning of its habitat. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is mostly sedentary, although it may make some movements in order to find optimal feeding habitat as water levels vary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. In South Sudan there are regular seasonal movements between feeding and breeding zones<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Guillet 1978)<strong></strong>. It is very solitary. Even within the pair, male and female will often feed at opposite ends of their territory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Loose aggregations may occasionally occur where receding water levels and large numbers of fish become concentrated in a small area (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It breeds solitarily, usually maintaining a density of fewer than three nests per square kilometre (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The breeding season is long. Eggs are laid at the end of the rains, as waters start to recede, and chicks fledge towards the end of the dry season (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding </em>It both breeds and forages in seasonally flooded marshes, but may utilise separate habitats for foraging and breeding (Renson 1998, Ngwenyama 2012).<strong></strong> The vegetation in these flooded marshes is dominated by a mixture of papyrus <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, reeds e.g. <em>Phragmites</em> spp., cattails<em> </em><em>Typha</em> spp. and grasses, particularly <em>Miscanthidium</em> spp. (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992).<em> </em>It is often found in areas with abundant floating vegetation, often papyrus (Baker 1996)<strong></strong>. It also uses permanent non-papyrus swamps in areas such as the Malagarasi (Tanzania) (Dinesen and Baker 2006) and Lake Victoria (Uganda)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007). <em>Non-breeding </em>It usually forages in shallow water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong><strong></strong> where it makes use of clear channels among the vegetation that have been created by the movements of large mammals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It tends to avoid areas where the vegetation is too dense to be penetrated easily, or is taller than the bird's back (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It is reported to prefer water that is poorly oxygenated, where fish are forced to surface to breathe, and are thus more easily caught (Guillet 1978)<strong></strong>, which is why it is thought not to frequent swamps that are characterised by papyrus alone (Guillet 1978). In South Sudan it has been known to forage on rice fields and other flooded plantations (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992).<strong> Diet </strong>When feeding, it shows a preference for lungfish <em>Protopterus aethiopicus</em>, but takes a variety of fish species including Senegal Bichir <em>Polypterus senegalus</em>, catfish <em>Clarias</em> spp. and tilapia <em>Tilapia </em>spp. (Guillet 1979, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It also preys on aquatic animals such as amphibians, young crocodiles and watersnakes (Briggs 2007<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span>Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), and may even take rodents and young waterfowl (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). Diet seems to vary geographically: lungfish and catfish are the main prey species in Uganda, and catfish and watersnakes the preferred diet in Zambia (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, Mullers and Amar 2015a).<strong> Breeding site </strong>The nest is grassy construction, up to 3 m wide, on a mound of floating vegetation or a small island (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>, and often among dense stands of papyrus (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The maximum clutch size is three, although usually only one nestling will survive, with rare records of two chicks fledging (Mullers and Amar 2015b). The species can live for around 50 years (although it is likely to live less long in the wild [R. Mullers <em>in litt. </em>2016]),&#160;takes three to four years to reach reproductive maturity, and is monogamous.<strong> </strong> <p></p>","Throughout most of its range, the species is threatened by habitat destruction and degradation, disturbance, hunting, and capture for the bird trade (see Collar and Stuart 1985, Baker 1996, T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002). Suitable habitat is being converted for cultivation and pasture, and cattle have been known to trample nests (Briggs 2007), while in Uganda and the Sudd exploration for oil may impact this species by altering its habitat and the oil polluting the environment (Dodman 2013). Pollution may also be significant in Uganda, where agrochemicals and tannery effluents run off or are disposed of into Lake Victoria (Dodman 2013). The species is hunted for food and cultural reasons, for example it may be viewed as a bad omen. It is also captured for the zoo trade, which is a problem especially in Tanzania where trading of the species is still legal (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>. Interviews with people in the Bangweulu Wetlands (Zambia) indicate that eggs and chicks are taken for consumption and sale, probably to zoos or collectors (Roxburgh <em>et al. </em>2006). Five chicks per month were estimated as taken for trade in one district in 2011, with only two individuals surviving the transit (D. Ngwenyama <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In 2007, an undisclosed number of specimens, illegally imported from Tanzania, were confiscated by the Danish authorities in Copenhagen<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007) and at least two birds were exported from Tanzania to a zoo in the USA (T. Dodman <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Small-scale trading poses a serious threat to small local populations rather than the global population (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>, though recent reports suggest that levels of disturbance and trade are not sustainable in Zambia (T. Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011). Breeding success may be as low as 10% annually in Bangweulu, mainly due to human disturbance (Mullers and Amar 2015b). During the 2011-2013 breeding seasons, only 10 out of 25 chicks successfully fledged: four chicks were killed in fires, one was depredated&#160;and 10 were taken by humans (R. Muller <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Zambia, fire and drought threaten habitat (especially in Bangweulu, where a decline is apparent) (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, there is some evidence for trapping and persecution (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, and nests are trampled by large herbivores feeding in the swamps (Renson 1998)<strong></strong>. Conflict in Rwanda and DRC has disrupted protected areas (e.g. Akagera National Park) that support the species (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, and the proliferation of firearms has greatly facilitated hunting. In South Sudan, its stronghold, it has been said to be ""very much endangered by destruction of papyrus swamps by cattle and fire"" (Nikolaus 1987)<strong></strong>. Between 1952 and 1980 the area of the Sudd swamps of South Sudan increased (Howell <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong></strong> from 6,700 km<sup>2</sup> to 19,200 km<sup>2</sup>. Whilst this habitat was earlier threatened by drainage due to plans for the Jonglei Canal, these plans are no longer supported, though canalisation and related schemes for the oil industry do pose a threat&#160; (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> 2008). The construction of several dams along the lower Nile will allow artificial manipulation of water levels in the Sudd (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>. In the Malagarasi, large areas of miombo woodland adjacent to swamps are being cleared for tobacco farming and agriculture, and the human population, which includes fishermen, farmers and semi-nomadic pastoralists, has increased very rapidly in recent decades (Dinesen and Baker 2006). In this region, dry-season burning and cattle-grazing in the species's core area are severe and expanding, and the first rice paddies have appeared at the edge of the species's key swamps. Over four years only 7 of 13 nests were successful at this location (John <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;Also in Malagarasi, a railway line has bisected swamps and rice paddies in some of its core areas<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Records of birds outside their core areas may be due to the displacement of birds by fires in dry years <strong></strong>(Dinesen and Baker 2006).<p></p>","The total population has been estimated at 5,000-8,000 individuals (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> 2002), and a total population estimate of fewer than 10,000 individuals is supported by Dinesen and Baker (2006). The range of 5,000-8,000 individuals roughly equates to 3,300-5,300 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Balaeniceps rex</em> is widely but very locally distributed in large swamps from <strong>South Sudan</strong> to <strong>Zambia</strong>. Approximate national estimates proposed by T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International (2002) are: c.5,000 in South Sudan (50-80% of the total population [Briggs 2007]), 100-150 in <strong>Uganda</strong> (but possibly over 200 [Briggs 2007]),<strong>&#160;</strong><strong></strong>100-500 in western <strong>Tanzania</strong> (this figure also proposed by Dinesen and Baker [2006]), &lt;500 in<strong> Zambia</strong><strong> </strong>(Roxburgh and Buchanan<em> </em>[2010] gave a later estimate of 1,760, with 1,296 in the Bangweulu Swamps alone, but this is possibly an over-estimate [F.

In 1997, the population was estimated to be 12,000-15,000 individuals (Rose and Scott 1997), but a more recent review makes a conservative estimate of 5,000-8,000 individuals (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International 2002). This figure may prove too low, depending on research into the South Sudan populations (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International 2002). An estimate of 3,830 birds was given for the Sudd (including areas of Zeraf Reserve) by Fay <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2007). A total population of less than 10,000 individuals is supported by a literature review in which the extent of certain wetland habitats was found to have been significantly overestimated by previous studies. Surveys in September-October 2005 support the suggestion that there are a few hundred individuals in the Malagarasi region of Tanzania (Briggs 2007).

It discriminates strongly in favour of sites that are infrequently visited by man<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Cramp and Simmons 1980)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. <em>Breeding </em>It breeds in the lowland taiga and taiga-tundra transition zone (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong> where it occurs in moss-covered marshland<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>Johnsgard 1983), tidal bogs, marshes and other wetland depressions with unrestricted visibility (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. It may also breed on brushland interspersed with woods<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cramp and Simmons 1980)<strong></strong>. The preferred nesting habitat in Yakutia was found to consist of damp tidal flat with well-developed vegetative cover made up of typical polygonal swamp associations of sedges and cottongrass (<em>Eriophorum</em>) forming sparse, short stands<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>Johnsgard 1983). In late springs some birds have been known to nest on drier, more hilly areas of polygonal tundra, and non-breeders sometimes occur on high, hilly banks of rivers and lakes and in small depressions between large, elongated hills<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>Johnsgard 1983). <em>Non-breeding </em>Resting areas and stopovers on migration tend to consist of large, isolated wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. Bogs and salt-licks used by ungulates, particularly <em>Alces alces</em>, offer greater foraging resources as trampling by the ungulates exposes rhizomes and roots on which the cranes forage (Degtyarev and Sleptsov 2013).<em>&#160;</em>It winters in the shallows and mudflats of seasonal lakes of the Yangtze Basin (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>, as well as steppes near water, open jheels and swamps<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>Johnsgard 1983). Those that winter in India and Iran use artificial water impoundments and flooded rice fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>.<strong> <br/><br/>Diet </strong>This species is omnivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. <em>Breeding </em>During the summer its diet is broad, consisting primarily of roots, rhizomes, seeds, sprouts of sedges and other plant materials, but also insects, fish, rodents and other small animals (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season it feeds mainly on roots, bulbs, tubers (especially of sedges), rhizomes, sprouts and stems of aquatic plants, and sometimes aquatic animals if these are readily available (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site </strong>It builds a large mound of grass and sedge 50-80 cm in diameter emerging above water 25-60 cm deep (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. It typically lays two eggs but generally does not fledge more than one chick.<strong> </strong> <p></p>","The key threat to this species is wetland loss and degradation at wintering sites and staging areas through diversion of water for human use, agricultural development, the development of oilfields and increased human utilisation. The most significant threat to the eastern flyway is a proposed dam at the outlet of Poyang Lake to stabilize water flows for navigation, irrigation, and other economic purposes–to be built in part in response to impacts of the Three Gorges Dam on water levels in the Yangtze River. Management of water levels to sustain ecosystem function will be critical to the long-term viability of this species (Harris and Zhuang 2010). Severe drought caused Poyang Lake to shrink dramatically in the winters of 2003-2004, 2006-2007 (Anon 2007), and 2010-2011. The most recent drought forced birds to feed in sub-optimal upland habitat. Construction of the Three Gorges Dam changed the hydrological pattern of the lower Yangtze river and may have a major impact on the wintering population, as may the quantity of sand-dredging that is also occurring along the Yangtze (Larson 2018). In Western Siberia the establishment of oilfields and associated urban developments are significant causes of habitat loss and degradation (Van Impe 2013).<br/><br/>Increasing levels of human disturbance are also a problem, particularly at Poyang Lake, where crab farming may restrict access to high-quality foraging habitat (Burnham <em>et al. </em>2017). Along eastern migration routes, water has been diverted from the Zhalong and Momoge National Nature Reserve for human use. Although water releases to sustain wetland functions have been negotiated, sustaining these releases over the long term will be important, especially for Momoge. Also canals and fragmentation within the reserve have altered water flow. Limited fresh water has caused marshes in the Huanghe Delta National Reserve to dry up, and the harvesting of reeds by people has seriously disturbed cranes (Shan Kai <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). A hydro-electric scheme is also proposed for the headwaters of the Aldan River basin, the construction of power lines northwards to Yakutsk, and oil and gas prospecting (Prentice and Stishov 2007). Overhunting of <em>Alces alces</em> reduces availability of rhizomes and roots usually exposed by trampling (Degtyarev and Sleptsov 2013). Disturbance from boating activities is also a problem at stopover sites. Hunting on passage and wintering grounds in Iran is the key threat to the Central/Western population (G. Sundar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2004), and inhibits recovery. Poisoning targeted at waterbirds in China, e.g. Huanzidong Reservoir, Shenyang Region, may also affect this species. Pesticide use and pollution is a threat in India. Climate change may be a long term threat to breeding sites, with changes in the permafrost layer causing expansion of lakes and the loss of islands, peninsulas and low-lying shorelines (Harris 2008, Van Impe 2013). The expansion of lakes and subsequent habitat modification has been on-going in the breeding grounds of the eastern population since the 1950s (Pshennikov and Germogenov 2008).<br/><p></p>","The population is estimated at 3,500-4,000 individuals, based on a count of 3,750 at Poyang Lake in 2008 (Yu Changhao <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008) and counts of 3,400 at Momoge in May 2011 and at Poyang in early 2012. The western subpopulation numbers only a single individual aside from reintroduced birds.",Decreasing,"<em>Leucogeranus leucogeranus</em> breeds in Arctic <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Russia </span>in Yakutia and West Siberia (BirdLife International 2001). Two regional populations are recognised; the western population has a small remnant population estimated at less than 20 individuals (Van Impe 2013). The Eastern Flyway population breeds between the rivers Kolyma and Yana and south to the Morma mountains in Yakutia. Non-breeding birds, typically those up to three years old, summer in Dauria on the border between Russia, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mongolia </span>(Tseveenmyadag 2005) and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span>. Birds have also been recorded in summer in central Mongolia (Tseveenmyadag 2007, 2008). The main wintering sites were in the middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze river; now almost the entire population winters at or very near Poyang Lake, China. Surveys of the districts and counties around the lake show an increase in birds using the location from around a hundred birds in 1980/81 to an estimated 3,902 individuals in winter 2002/2003, since when the population has fluctuated between lows of around 2,000 individuals in 2008/2009 and 2012/2013, and highs of 3,800-4,000 individuals in the winters of 2005/2006, 2007/2008 and 2011/2012 (Li Fengshan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Wang <em>et al. </em>2017), though no more than 3,500 have been counted since then (Wang <em>et al. </em>2017). <br/><br/>The species relies on a network of important wetlands along its migration route, which follows the Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma Rivers through Yakutia before continuing along the Aldan River and tributaries and south into China. Jilin province hosts birds during both passage periods during March to May and September to November, with numbers at Momoge National Nature Reserve peaking at 3,590 individuals in May 2012 and 3,639 individuals in late October 2012 (Jiang Hongxing 2013). High spring counts at this site appear to be increasing: 1,156 in May 2007, 2,183 in April 2008, 3,128 in May 2010 and 3,400 in May 2011 (Zou Chang-Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2008, Jiang Hongxing 2010, Jiang Hongxing pers. comm. 2011). In Liaoning province, Huanzidong Reservoir in Shenyang region, 900 Siberian Cranes have been recorded during autumn migration (Li Fengshan 2003, Zhou Haixiang 2006), and 1,100 in spring (Bai Qing-Quan 2008), and numbers at Wolong Lake peaked at 1,200 in March 2008 (Bai Qing-Quan 2008). After an exceptional (due to flow restrictions caused by dams) flood on the River Zeya, a tributary of the Amur, in 2013, small numbers have been observed at Muraviovka Park in far east Russia during autumn migration (Heim <em>et al. </em>2017). The first record of the species in Taiwan (China) was made in December 2014, when one individual was observed (K-C. Hung <em>in litt</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The Western/Central Flyway population is divided into Central Asian and Western Asian flocks. The Central Asian flock breeds on the basin of the Kunovat river, the north of West Siberia, Russia (Sorokin and Kotyukov 1982), and wintered at Keoladeo National Park, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>; however, none have been seen at Keoladeo since winter 2001/2002 (Vardhan 2002), and this flock may now be extinct; unconfirmed, but credible reports of the species have continued from West Siberia, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and India, however (Shilina 2008).

Eleven range states signed a Memorandum of Understanding under the Convention for Migratory Species (CMS MoU) and develop Conservation Plans every three years. To help protect key wetland sites, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Crane Foundation conducted the UNEP/GEF Siberian Crane Wetland Project from 2003-2009, conceived in 1998, to protect and manage a network of sites across Asia critical to Siberian Cranes and 26 other threatened species (del Hoyo<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 1996, G. Sundar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2004, Mirande 2007, 2010, Prentice 2010). Achievements include improved protection for over 2.4 million hectares through designation of four new reserves, expansion of three others and upgraded legal protection status at another three, the designation of five new Ramsar sites, new management plans and improved capacity for many sites, and an extensive environmental education programme (Prentice 2010). Since 2002, Crane Day Celebrations in seven Siberian Crane Range States, including Siberian Crane Festivals in West Siberia and Kazakhstan, promote conservation of this endangered species and its habitats (Moore and Ilyashenko 2010). Hunting societies throughout the former Soviet Union countries (Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) have been engaged and now distribute information about crane conservation when issuing hunting licenses (Ilyashenko and Mirande 2013). Volunteer committees among hunters have been created in Afganistan and Pakistan to share information on crane conservation and extensive poster campaigns and a documentary film have been distributed (Ilyashenko and Mirande 2013). A set of four national stamps were published in Iran in 2008 to help raise public awareness of the Siberian Crane and the importance of wetland conservation within the country (Faseli 2007), and a documentary on the species focusing on the last returning individual in Iran was broadcast in 2011 (Vuosalo 2013). <br/><br/>Some birds have been marked and fitted with satellite transmitters (Germogenov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Researchers monitoring breeding sites in the remote Yakutia region incorporated remote sensing given the difficulties monitoring on the ground (Stishov and Bysykatova 2008). Key protected areas where monitoring occurs include Kytalyk, Chaygurgino, and Middle Aldan (Russia), Momoge, Poyang and Dongting (China), and Naurzum (Kazakhstan). The North East Asian Crane Site Network has been established under the East Asia-Australasian Flyway Partnership. Twelve important Siberian Crane sites along both Western and Central Flyways are designated in the Western/Central Asian Site Network for the Siberian Crane and other waterbirds established under CMS MoU and UNEP/GEF SCWP, and another 24 sites are proposed for inclusion. Four flourishing colonies of captive Siberian Cranes successfully raise the species for education and conservation purposes. The fifth issue of the International Studbook was published in 2009 (Kashentseva and Belterman 2009). Captive-raised birds have been released in an effort to maintain the Central Asian (G. Sundar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2004) and Western Asian flocks (Zadegan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).

This includes: 1) water management at Poyang needs to sustain wetland productivity and ensure that extensive mudflats and shallow water areas are available throughout the winter, 2) strengthen integrated water management at migratory stopover sites in north-east China, guided by on-going monitoring of the condition of these wetlands, to support wetland ecosystems that can support cranes, 3) maintain or improve water quality at key stopover and migration sites to avoid detrimental ecosystem change or direct impacts on crane survival, 4) continue long-term research on the effects of changes in water levels on water plants and water birds at Poyang and at sites in north-east China, and 5) protect and manage additional stopover sites, especially from Liaoning to Jiangxi Provinces, based on further investigation of migratory habitats. <br/><br/>Determine movements and behavior of birds during their first summer to identify and manage key sites for sub-adult birds. Investigate potential impacts of climate change on Yakutian breeding grounds. Identify, legally protect and manage key staging areas in Yakutia, accompanied by mitigation of development impacts along the flyway. Provide technical assistance on wildlife health monitoring and management practices at staging and wintering areas. Incorporate management of Western/Central Asian Site Network for Siberian Cranes and other Migratory Waterbirds under the broader Central Asia Flyway Initiative for migratory birds and continue support for captive breeding programmes.

It now requires an urgent acceleration in targeted conservation actions in order to prevent it from becoming functionally extinct within a few decades. <p></p> <p></p>","This species inhabits arid and semi-arid grasslands with scattered short scrub, bushes and low intensity cultivation in flat or gently undulating terrain. Birds congregate in traditional less disturbed grassland patches to breed during mid-summer and monsoon. It nests in open ground, laying only one clutch (consisting of one and very rarely two eggs) per year. Outside of breeding season, it probably makes local and possibly long distance nomadic movements (largely unknown) in response to various factors, using areas rich in food resources and surrounded by natural grass-scrub habitat (including agricultural fields [G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016]) for easy navigation. It requires different microhabitat envelopes for different activities, such as grasslands with relatively tall (vegetation 25-100cm) and dense cover, high insect resources and less grazing for nesting; short sparse vegetation (&lt;25 cm vegetation) on slightly elevated ground for display; sparse vegetation (&lt;25 cm vegetation) with minimal scrub for roosting; and moderate (25-50 cm) vegetation or medium sized trees for shade or roosting (Rahmani 1989, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","Historically, widespread hunting for sport and food precipitated its decline, accelerated by vehicular access to remote areas. High intensity poaching still continues in Pakistan (which is probably shared with western Rajasthan and Kachchh populations), where 49 birds were hunted out of 63 that were sighted over a period of four years (Khan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Some poaching continues in India as well (Sridhar 2005, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011, Anon. 2013a, Anon. 2015), including one documented case where mine-workers that lost their livelihoods when mines near Gwalior were closed for the creation of the Ghatigaon Bustard Sanctuary hunted bustards to undermine the criteria on which the area was first designated as a sanctuary (Sridhar 2005). Additionally, in 2012, a bird was poached inside the protected area in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan (P. Patil&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012, G. Bhardwaj&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Hunting was also prevalent in Maharashtra in the past (Anon. 2015).&#160;Egg-collecting was rampant in many states during the early 19th century, and prevails very sporadically in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011). <br/><br/>However, the current threats are mostly from habitat loss and degradation, caused by; 1) widespread agricultural expansion and mechanization of farming; 2) infrastructural development such as irrigation (including a canal at Nannaj GIB Sanctuary [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]), roads, electricity pylons, wind turbines and constructions; 3) mining and industrialization; 4) well intended but ill-informed habitat management (Singh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006); and 5) lack of community support (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2011, 2013, 2015). With increased availability of water due to Government irrigation policies, agriculture has spread over vast arid–semiarid grasslands. For example, the Indira Gandhi Nahar Project has caused drastic hydraulic changes and massive agricultural conversion in and around the Desert National Park Sanctuary. Moreover, irrigation facilities and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in the crop pattern from bustard–friendly traditional monsoonal crops (sorghum, millet, etc.) to cash crops (sugarcane, grapes, cotton, horticulture, etc.), which are not suitable for the species. Due to ill-defined land distribution policies and the ambiguity arising from segregated ownership between private, community and government bodies, encroachment is a major problem in many bustard areas, especially in and around bustard sanctuaries of Maharashtra, Kachchh and Rajasthan. <br/><br/>Activities such as mining, stone quarrying, growth of industries, heavy pesticide use, grassland conversion and power projects along with the expansion of roads, electricity pylons, wind turbines, solar energy projects and other infrastructures have increased the severity of habitat degradation and disturbance (Anon 2015).&#160;The population in Madhya Pradesh has been lost due to trespassing, encroachment, mining and quarrying activities (Anon. 2015).&#160;Two individuals in Maharashtra (P. Patil <em>in litt</em> 2011) and one individual in Kachchh were reportedly killed by collisions with power-lines (Gadhavi 2014). Traditionally, grasslands and scrub have been considered as wasteland and the Forest Department policy, until recently, has been to convert them to forests with plantation of fuel/fodder shrub/tree species, even exotics like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Prosopis juliflora</span>,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><em>Acacia tortilis</em>,<em>&#160;</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gliricidia&#160;</span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eucalyptus </span>spp., under social forestry and compensatory afforestation schemes (Forest (Conservation) Act 1988; Indian Forest Act 1927) resulting in further loss of habitat. Afforestation has been highlighted as a problem at five sites used by the species:&#160;Thar desert (Rajasthan),&#160;Naliya (Gujarat), Nannaj (Maharashtra), Ranibennur (Kamataka) and Rollapadu (Andhra Pradesh) (Anon. 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016, G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016). Overgrazing on unprotected lands has also led to degradation of some areas (Mathew 2007, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Anon. 2013c, P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011), especially in the Thar desert (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016), and nest failure is commonly attributed to trampling by livestock (Anon. 2013c, Collar and Kirwan 2015). Hunting and egg collection remains a threat (Anon. 2014a). Free-ranging dogs pose a threat at all sites in India through disturbance of nesting adults and destruction of eggs (Anon. 2014c, 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015), while free-ranging pigs may also pose a threat (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Nests may also be predated by House Crows (<em>Corvus splendens</em>) (Collar and Kirwan 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Antagonism towards the species by local people is a major threat, and one reported to be increasing around Desert National Park Sanctuary due to political interests of local leaders (Anon. 2015). <p></p>","The species's total population was estimated at c. 300 individuals in 2008, indicating that there are probably fewer than 250 mature individuals remaining, hence the population is placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species&#160;occurs in the Indian Subcontinent, with former strongholds in the Thar desert in the north-west and the Deccan tableland of the Peninsula (BirdLife International 2001). It has been extirpated from 90% of its former range and is now principally confined to Rajasthan. In 2014 a survey of the Thar Desert, Rajasthan,&#160;estimated the species was present at a density of 0.61 ± 0.36 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, yielding abundance estimates of 103 ± 62 in the sampled area (16.9 km<sup>2</sup>) and 155 ± 94 individuals in the Thar landscape (25,488 km<sup>2</sup>). During the survey, 38 individuals were detected (Dutta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), and surveys in 2015 found 40 individuals (G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016). Smaller&#160;populations (likely to be considerably fewer than 15-20 birds [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]) are present in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, with birds now absent from Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2015), <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>. It is also reported to breed in <strong>Pakistan</strong>, however, information on breeding activity has not been published (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Recent declines have been noted in several areas, including Maharashtra (Kasambe<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2006, P. Patil<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2011, Anon. 2015), Kachchh (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012) and Rajasthan (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015). In Maharashtra, the latest population estimates suggest a population as low as 10 individuals (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2016, G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016), and numbers have been falling in the Bustard Sanctuary since at least the late 1980s, with the 2010 census recording only nine individuals and only three individuals (one male and two females) recorded in 2014 (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2014), while breeding has not been recorded there since 2007 at least (P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). A recent survey in Nashik, Maharashtra failed to find the species (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2014), whilst a survey in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra provided an estimate of six or seven birds between April 2012 and May 2013 (Anon. 2014b). Populations in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are considered at risk of local extinction (Anon. 2015).&#160;In Kachchh the latest population estimate is fewer than 20 birds at densities of 0.05 per km<sup>2</sup> in c. 400 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The species is likely to be close to disappearing from Karnataka (Kumara and Mohan Raj 2007, S. Kottur <em>in litt</em>.), and it is thought to have completely disappeared from the states of Haryana, Punjab, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2015), India, but some apparently survive in&#160;Pakistan, with reports from several localities (Khan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, Anon. 2013c, B. Lechleiter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011). Indian states in order of importance for the species are as follows: Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (Anon. 2015). Sites in order of priority for the species are: Desert National Park Sanctuary (Rajasthan), Naliya (Gujarat), Warora (Maharashtra) and Bellary (Karnataka) (Anon. 2015).<br/><br/>Its total population has declined from an estimated 1,260 individuals in 1969 to c. 300 individuals in 2008 (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010), equivalent to a reduction of c. 82% over 47 years (three generations), assuming an exponential trend. The results of a recent genetic study, in which the effective population size was estimated from the diversity of mitochondrial DNA, provide support for an estimate of fewer than 1,000 birds, and likely about 500 during the period 2006-2010, when samples were collected (Ishtiaq <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). This study found very low genetic diversity for such a widespread species, probably owing to a bottleneck event caused by its widespread extermination possibly even before the mid 19th century (Ishtiaq <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Population viability analysis predicts a high probability of local extinction within 50 years for populations numbering fewer than 30 individuals, with the more secure population of over 100 individuals showing sensitivity to the loss of one additional adult each year to human causes, indicating that present levels of off-take are unsustainable (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Current levels of hunting may result in the extinction of even the largest western Indian population in the next 15-20 years (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. In India it is legally protected under&#160;Schedule 1 (<span lang=""EN-IN"">Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act 2002 [<span lang=""EN-IN"">Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India&#160;2003])&#160;and there are severe  penalties for killing an individual. It has been the focus of several  publicity initiatives aimed at reducing hunting. Since 1981, extensive  fieldwork has investigated its status, distribution and ecology, and a  detailed conservation strategy has been published. Protected areas have  been specifically established for the species (Sonkhaliya-Sorson,  Lala-Naliya, Gaga-Bhatiya, Karera, Ghatigaon, Nannaj and Ranibennur), and  populations occur in some others (Desert National Park Sanctuary and Rollapadu  Wildlife Sanctuary). Desert National Park Sanctuary has now been proposed as a Biosphere Reserve by the Indian government (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Despite some failures (local extinctions in Sorson, Karera,&#160;Ghatigaon,&#160;Gaga-Bhatiya and Ranibennur), there have been some successes, and one female was recently seen in Sonkhaliya Lesser Florican area (D. Nandan <em>per. </em>P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).  Rehabilitation of grasslands has benefited the species in some  areas (particularly Desert National Park Sanctuary [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]). Grassland restoration through tree (<em>Gliricidia spp.</em>)<em>&#160;</em>removal has taken place at the GIB Sanctuary in Maharashtra (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016) and within six months Great Indian Bustards were seen in the area (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Tree removal&#160;is also planned for the Rollapadu Sanctuary (Anon. 2015).&#160;A programme of management to remove an invasive weed species,&#160;<em>Prosopis juliflora</em>, from&#160;grassland in Kachchh proved successful as within seven days, Great Indian Bustard was observed in the cleared area (Anon. 2014c).&#160;<br/><br/>The Indian government has provided financial support to  conservation actions for this species in some regions (Anon. 2009), and&#160;in association with several NGOs and experts has developed guidelines for State Action Plan for Resident Bustards’ recovery programme (Dutta <em>et.al.</em> 2013), as well as identifying key policies to protect grassland habitats (Anon. 2011a). 'Project Great Indian Bustard' has been launched in Rajasthan including  constructing breeding enclosures for the species and developing infrastructure to  reduce human pressure on habitats (Anon. 2013b). In Kachchh, a pilot programme has been established to neuter stray dogs around the core areas of the Bustard Sanctuary (Anon. 2014c). At the same time the dogs are vaccinated against rabies which will benefit the local community. Meetings and processions with local communities have been carried out in  the past by the Bombay Natural History Society (Rahmani 2006) to  generate support for birds among local people; and a&#160;procession was organised to establish a statue of Great Indian Bustard in a Hindu temple at Sankhala village in Rajasthan (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). More recently (March  2011), the Great Indian Bustard Foundation group held a two-day meeting with  communities within and around the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary at  Nannaj (Patil 2011). Nearly 600 villagers attended and discussions  covered the problems of local people and threats to the species (Patil  2011). School awareness programmes and large-scale community awareness programmes are also underway (e.g. Rahmani 1998, Sanctuary Asia 2016). Publicity materials and media stories have been produced to raise awareness of the species in India (Anon. 2015), and engagement activities with shepherd communities have aided in species monitoring and raising awareness (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>In August 2013 a three-year BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Programme/RSPB funded project was initiated with Bombay Natural History Society (Anon. 2014a), and a further project supported by the Whitely Fund for Nature (WFN) has also begun (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). A programme of research was set up to monitor the species and its grassland habitats (Anon. 2014a). In India, workshops on implementing conservation plans were held in four states with Great Indian Bustard populations, capacity-building workshops were also held for members of the local community, NGO and Government staff (Anon. 2015). A community awareness campaign was held in the Thar desert, Rajasthan between February and March 2014. Advocacy work under this project has helped to reduce community resentment against the species (including initiating a livestock health-check programme),&#160;and led to well-informed conservation planning, better coordination between different stakeholders, and mutual cooperation between different departments over conservation issues (Anon. 2014d, Anon. 2015).&#160;Community resentment may also be further reduced by making protected areas more targeted towards the habitats where the species occurs, as has been attempted in Maharashtra (Varghese <em>et al. </em>2016). Emergency conservation has been prepared for&#160;Rollapadu&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary, Andhra Pradesh, and for Karera and Ghatigaon GIB Sanctuaries in Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2014d).&#160;To clear confusions over land records and ownership related issues inside Desert National Park a new scientific map is being prepared (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Rajasthan State Forest Department has initiated a process of transferring land inside Desert National Park Sanctuary from State Revenue Department to State Forest Department, and the Rajasthan State Forest Department has secured more breeding habitat for species by increasing the number and size of closures across important breeding patches (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Additionally,&#160;the Rajasthan State Forest Department has banned construction of any new wind turbine in prime bustard landscape (e.g. in region of Jasialmer [G. Bharwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016]) without prior permission and clearance from the government, and predator-proof fences are being made to prevent the entry of free-ranging dogs, pigs, foxes, and monitor lizards into Great Indian Bustard breeding areas (G. Bharwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016, P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Planting of plant species other than local grasses has been discouraged in prime habitat by Rajasthan Forest Department and waterholes are being strictly maintained with a constant supply of water (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Camera traps have been installed at waterholes to monitor threats and species movement (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;BNHS has initiated an advocacy with Indian Army in order to monitor and protect individuals inside army managed restricted areas (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). A protected area for the species has been reportedly proposed by NGOs in Pakistan (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>The PEP and WFN projects have also supported local communties. The measures involved include developing the community network to monitor the species and its threats and supporting ecosystem-based livelihood practices. For instance, the&#160;Rajasthan State Forest Department (in collaboration with BNHS) has initiated livelihood leverage for women near Desert National Park through the setting up of local craft businesses, and have&#160;involved local community Eco-Development Committees (EDC) into conservation actions benefiting people (Anon 2016). These programmes have also directly supported local livelihood through efforts such as the ‘Local Community Nature Guide Program’ at Desert National Park Sanctuary (Anon 2014d, Anon 2015, Anon 2016); and&#160;BNHS in collaboration with Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) and Rajasthan State Forest Department have organised field training on the prevention of wildlife crime with special reference to Great Indian Bustard for ground level staff of State Forest Department Staff in Jaisalmer (Anon 2016).&#160;More guards have also been recruited to help protect the Great Indian Bustard in Desert National Park Sanctuary, and the local youth have been engaged in monitoring and patrolling by the State Forest Department (Anon 2016).&#160;Additionally, a capacity building programme was organised on Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act for State Forest Department Officers in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>Threats such as large powerlines and wind turbines have been mapped over prime habitat (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016), and considering the threat of disturbance from wildlife photographers during breeding season, photography of Great Indian Bustard has been banned in Gujarat and has been discouraged elsewhere in India (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). The Government of India (Wildlife Institute of India) in collaboration with Rajasthan State Forest Department has also proposed an ex-situ conservation project in Rajasthan (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><strong><br/></strong><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>A vast array of conservation actions have been proposed for this species, from a range of sources (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India have set up a Task Force to guide field implementation of bustard conservation actions. The Government of India has published guidelines for the state action plan for resident bustards’ recovery programme through meetings and workshops involving many parties (officials, experts, local people) (Dutta <em>et al.</em> 2013). Rajasthan State Government has set up a sub-committee on rationalisation of boundaries of Desert National Park Sanctuary (Upadhyay <em>et al.</em> 2015) and put forward measures through&#160;‘Project Great Indian Bustard’; and&#160;IUCN Bustards Specialists Group along with Bombay Natural History Society and Rajasthan State Forest Department has published a 30 points action plan for saving Great Indian Bustard in Thar Desert, Rajasthan (Collar <em>et al. </em>2015). Broadly speaking, the proposed conservation actions are:&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>1) To consolidate core breeding areas identified across the species’s range by creating strict refuges during prime breeding months (March–September). This will require acquiring government lands that are not owned by Forest Departments; making all core areas inviolate by chain-link-fencing and patrolling guards; and removing nest predators therein. It has also been proposed that&#160;southernmost part of Desert National Park Sanctuary should be de-notified as it is highly degraded because of agriculture, pockets of grasslands should be developed by handing over revenue lands to Forest Department, privately owned areas and tourist zones such as Sam sand dunes could be excluded from protected area boundaries.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>2) To formulate landscape conservation strategies in priority areas (informed by telemetry research). Evidence-based habitat management interventions should be planned and implemented (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012) including work to exclude any road construction activities and tall shrub/tree plantations as well as limiting grazing regimes. Infrastructure developments (roads, electricity network and wind turbines) known to have a negative effect on the species should be curtailed or minimised near core breeding areas, replaced by bustard-friendly alternatives (underground electric cables and passes), or have bird flight diverters attached. These actions can be achieved by declaring priority areas as community or conservation reserves or Eco-sensitive zones through legislation.&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>3) Community outreach. Local livelihoods should be linked with bustard conservation in priority areas by subsidy/incentive driven agro-environmental schemes that promote bustard-friendly farming practices, such as pesticide-free farming of short palatable crops separated by long fallow periods, and stall feeding of livestock during peak monsoon months. Community outreach to reduce resentment to the species should also be attempted, including providing facilities and services (e.g. local health care) (Anon 2011b, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Establish a&#160;‘Conservation Reserve’ or ‘Community Reserve’ under Indian law, with a view to financing, retaining and promoting traditional agriculture throughout, aiming at organic and fence-free farming with sustainable livestock levels.&#160;In association with NGO-Tiger Watch and Bombay Natural History Society, Rajasthan State Forest Department has also planned a ‘Great Indian Bustard Village Guardian Programme’.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>4) Provide more support and equipment to park staff, to better protect areas; and&#160;establish a volunteer warden programme modeled on those operating in tiger reserves elsewhere in India, to monitor and patrol areas as directed by park/police staff; potentially in conjunction with the army.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>5) Consider commencing an <em>ex situ</em> conservation breeding programme as an insurance against extinction. Since <em>in situ</em> conservation measures will require at least 5-10 years to be implemented and the rapidly declining population trend provides a window of &lt;5 years for procuring eggs from the wild, the implementation of a conservation breeding programme would have to be taken up urgently. However, this is not an alternative to effective habitat management, and is only a mechanism to repopulate extinction-prone small stocks after their habitats have been restored. Importantly, a recent study modelled the species's population dynamics and found that establishing effective <em>in situ</em> conservation measures within the next 10 years and not removing eggs from the wild would recruit more adult females to the wild population within 30 years than a programme of captive breeding and releases (Dolman <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span

134189710,22697531,Pseudibis davisoni,Critically Endangered,A3cd+4cd,2018,2018-08-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has a very small and fragmented population as a result of habitat loss, hydrological changes, hunting, disturbance and potentially a number of unknown factors, and is projected to undergo an extremely rapid population decline over the next three generations (25 years) owing to these on-going threats. It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered. If conservation efforts succeed in bringing the largest remaining populations, in north-eastern Cambodia and along the Mekong channel, under effective protection and predicted rates of decline are therefore lower, the species may warrant downlisting. <p></p> <p></p>","Wetlands and grassland, such as pools, marshes, open grasslands or watercourses including wide rivers with sand and gravel bars were formerly important for the species; however, at least in Indochina deciduous dipterocarp forest now appears to be of major importance (H. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. <em>Trapaengs</em> (seasonal pools) are particularly favoured during the dry (breeding) season when the species forages in the substrate around the edge of pools that are drying out (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013a), with a shift to matrix sites such as long- and seasonally abandoned rice fields, grasslands (often inundated after high rainfall) and the dipterocarp forest itself after rainfall events (Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010) and in the wet season (H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. The species has been recorded along large rivers such as the Mekong in Cambodia and on the Mahakam in Kalimantan. It has also been recorded from the mosaic of shrub and grasslands on the Tonle Sap floodplain. In Cambodia, it has been recorded nesting during the dry season (December-May) in remnant dry forest close to seasonally abandoned wet season rice paddy fields, large contiguous areas of dry forest, and in flooded forest within the Mekong channel. Two nests in Kalimantan were located at heights of 30 m and 40 m in tall trees along tributaries of the Mahakam river - the main breeding here may be during September-December at least (Sutrisno <em>et al. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. It has been observed feeding in soft substrates on the forest floor as well as at small waterbodies (T. Clements <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>; also in sediment formations in river channels. Amphibians (e.g.&#160;<em>Microhyla</em> frogs and Paddy Frogs <em>Fejevarya limnocharis</em> from around <em>trapaengs</em> [Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013a]), form the majority of their prey in the dry season, along with invertebrates such as molecrickets, insect larvae and occasionally eels, snakes and leeches, all of which are found at <em>trapaengs</em> (H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Wet season prey obtained from terrestrial habitats remains uncertain but ibis have been observed catching large worms and beetle larvae (Sum, P. and H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).  <br/><br/>In South-East Asia the species may be associated with large ungulates which may help to create and maintain seasonal pools within the dry forest landscape (T. Evans <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, and its preference for <em>trapaengs</em> with bare substrate and low vegetation supports this theory (Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Large wild ungulates have now all but disappeared from the region, and the species may now be more closely associated with domestic livestock (Wright <em>et al. </em>2010)<strong></strong>. Traditional, anthropogenic fires are likely to influence habitat suitability at foraging sites in grassland and dipterocarp forest, increasing coverage of bare ground that the ibis prefers (Wright<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2010, H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> &#160;2012). Available evidence gives no suggestion that the species undertakes major seasonal movements. The species aggregates into large flocks in the non-breeding season (the wet- and early dry seasons) (max. count of 185 individuals just south of Western Siem Pang IBA in September 2010 [H. Wright unpublished data]).  <p></p>","This species has declined as a result of habitat loss, through logging, widespread piecemeal clearance of lowland forest, conversion of wetlands for agriculture (most of the Mekong floodplain in southern Lao PDR has been converted to rice-paddy) and agro-industrial and infrastructure development (BirdLife International 2010). The proposed Lower Srepok 3 Dam is expected to cause the flooding of a large area of Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary (BirdLife International 2010), and the Xavaburi Dam in Lao PDR is expected to disrupt habitat in the Mekong River channel (Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Logging, the encroachment of plantation agriculture and settlement&#160; through the granting of economic land concessions is a significant and widespread threat, affecting all of the four largest known populations at Western Siem Pang IBA (BirdLife International 2010), Kulen Promtep and Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuaries and the dry forest around the Mekong River channel (Wright 2012, H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). In September 2012, more than 40% of the individuals recorded were found in roosts that were inside economic land concessions and more than 15% were within 5 km of a concession boundary (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<br/><br/>Habitat loss has been compounded by hunting of adult birds, eggs and chicks for food, and disturbance, leading to the loss of secure feeding, roosting and nesting areas (Clements <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Hunting pressure is exacerbated by the fact that their primary habitats appear to also be a focus for people: large rivers, forest pools and grassland/field complexes with high densities of ungulates and domestic livestock. However, hunting may now be less of a threat in Cambodia following education initiatives and the confiscation of weapons (H. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. However, poisoned baits set for hunting continue to affect some populations (Wright 2012). In addition, hunting may not be a serious threat in East Kalimantan, but fishing through poisoning and electro-fishing may negatively impact the population there (Sutrisno and Imanuddin 2002). Recent evidence suggests that forest fires in Borneo resulting from an El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event shifted the distribution of this species to unburnt stretches of rivers (Sözer and Nijman 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>There is considerable evidence that the species is associated with large ungulates in South-East Asia, which create and maintain the short-sward grassland feeding areas that the ibises depend upon within the dry forest landscape (T. Evans <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Hence, the demise of wild ungulates within the region may have catalysed its rapid decline resulting in few remote refugia for the species (R. Timmins<em></em>; T. Clements, <em>in litt</em>. 2007). Moreover, its dependency on herbivore-altered habitats means that remnant areas are close to people and associated with domestic livestock, making it more vulnerable to human-induced habitat modification (R. Timmins<em></em>; T. Clements, <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>, and a large proportion of the population occurs outside of protected areas (Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Of 609 individuals counted in 2011-2012, more than 80% roosted outside protected areas (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Probably the most significant threats currently come from land concessions for logging or plantations, and infrastructure development such as dam construction, which threaten even those areas that currently have protected status<strong> </strong>(Wright <em>et al. </em>2013b). <p></p>","The Indonesian population was estimated at 30-100 individuals but has apparently declined (Sozer and Nijman 2005).

It was previously widely but patchily distributed across much of Thailand, Lao PDR, south and central Vietnam and Cambodia, parts of Myanmar, Kalimantan (Indonesia), Sarawak (Malaysia) and south-west Yunnan, China, but has declined dramatically during the 20th century. It is extinct in Thailand and there are no recent records from Myanmar; and it has been described as the most threatened large waterbird in South-East Asia based on the widespread declines observed (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>It is almost certainly extinct as a breeding species in Viet Nam and now only occurs as a rare non-breeding visitor. In Cambodia, significant populations are known from Western Siem Pang (491 individuals counted in the 2015 census [BirdLife International, unpublished data)<em></em>, Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary in Ratanakiri (at least 242 individuals counted in September 2011 [Sum P. and H.

Tmatboey, in the Northern Plains, Cambodia, supports a small breeding population (up to 5 nests per year) with a maximum of 39 individuals recorded in the wet season (H.

Additional groups (1-10 birds each) have been recorded elsewhere; along the Mekong between Stung Treng and the Lao PDR border, eastern Siem, Pang district, the south-eastern shore of the Tonle Sap lake, Rovieng (Preah Vihear Province), Srepok river, Seima Protection Forest (Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007) and the O Te lowlands, Mondulkiri Province.

It is depicted on public awareness material distributed in Lao PDR and Cambodia. The species is considered to be the most threatened large waterbird in South-East Asia and was a priority species during the designation of Cambodian IBAs and priority areas for conservation in the 'dry forest ecoregion' of South-East Asia (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. Research has been conducted into the species's nesting ecology in Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and PhD research (2008-2012) studied the value of traditional land management and the species's foraging and nesting ecology, focused primarily on Western Siem Pang, Cambodia. Nest protection schemes with incentives to local people for finding and protecting nest-sites along the Mekong central section, in Western Siem Pang and Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary have been established. A community-managed ecotourism initiative has been established at Tmatboey incorporating nest finding and monitoring, as well as an agricultural certification scheme known as ""Ibis Rice"". <br/><br/>On 9th May 2016 Prime Minister Hun Sen signed a sub-decree declaring the new Prey Siem Pang Lech Wildlife Sanctuary, which covers about half of the Western Siem Pang IBA (65,389 ha), while the Protection Forest designation for the remaining 66,932 ha was upgraded to Wildlife Sanctuary status, a key part of BirdLife's Preventing Extinctions programme that has been implemented by the Species Guardian. This has been achieved through a concerted programme of lobbying and community awareness raising including producing and distributing a poster about the international conservation importance of Western Siem Pang, placing large information boards in five key villages informing local people about development plans and threats to their land from proposed concessions and working closely with the Forestry Association and Ministry of Environment in Cambodia.&#160;<br/><br/>Research and monitoring<strong> </strong>continues to be carried out, focusing on the foraging ecology of the species, nesting and flock size at roost sites and examining the value of trapeangs to the assemblies of waterbirds at the site. Pilot conservation work to deepen two key <em>trapaengs</em> in 2015 provided habitat for longer through the dry season and 15 further <em>trapaengs</em> have been deepened in 2017-18 (BirdLife International unpublished report).&#160;<br/><br/>A Local Conservation Group<strong> </strong>at Western Siem Pang has been supported since August 2007, and conducts monthly patrols to the most important trapaengs to record key species and any illegal activities. A Site Support Group is being established in Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary in order to support management, protection and monitoring at the sanctuary. In 2009, one chainsaw, 6.834 m<sup>3</sup> of luxury wood, four guns, and one ox-cart were confiscated and destroyed in Western Siem Pang as result of information provided by the patrol team (BirdLife International unpublished data)<strong></strong>. Coordinated roost counts have taken place in the wet season since 2009 (Wright 2012, BirdLife International Preventing Extinctions Programme).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue monitoring the known populations in Siem Pang, Northern Plains, Mekong channel, Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary and in other parts of its range using coordinated roost counts (Wright 2012). Establish a species working group to assist coordination and cooperation between conservation stakeholders, as well as researching the ecological requirements of the species in the wet season, the impacts of the human harvesting of amphibians and the value of domestic livestock grazing in areas of low-intermediate livestock density (Wright 2012)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Conduct further surveys in Borneo, central, northern and eastern Cambodia and the Satay area of Viet Nam to quantify remaining populations, only in areas where conservation intervention is considered reasonable and there are grounds for considering a significant population might be found. Focusing on areas close to settlement with traditional rice cultivation may be more productive than for core areas of remote forest. Establish further protected areas or integrated conservation development projects covering landscape-level habitat tracts supporting populations, particularly in northern Cambodia, the Mekong channel and along the Mahakam river, East Kalimantan. Enforce strict protection at important sites. Promote widespread conservation awareness programmes aimed at reducing wetland disturbance and large waterbird exploitation in Indochina.

It is likely to continue to decline extremely rapidly owing to on-going deforestation and human disturbance. It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","Singles, pairs or small parties occur in marshes, pools, wide rivers and seasonal water-meadows in open, predominantly deciduous, dipterocarp lowland forest, although it seems to be dependent on soft mud around seasonal pools (<em>trapaengs</em>). Its diet comprises a variety of invertebrates, crustaceans, eels, small amphibians and reptiles. It frequently feeds in soft mud, but forages on all substrates at <em>trapaengs</em>. It nests in trees, with a preference for large <em>Dipterocarpus</em> (Keo 2008) (90% of nesting trees are common deciduous dipterocarp species [Loveridge and Ty 2015]), generally more than 4 km from human habitation (<strong></strong>Keo 2008). Females almost always lay two eggs per clutch in the wet season <strong></strong>(Keo <em>et al.</em> 2009). Pools and seasonally flooded grassland with earthworm mounds are important in the breeding season, from June to September <strong></strong>(Keo 2008). It appears to be largely resident, but apparently wanders widely in response to local disturbance and seasonal water-levels. Generally territorial, the species remains in pairs or small family groups year-round. However, in the dry (non-breeding) season it may be found in small flocks of up to seven individuals or more (H. J. Rainey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).<p></p>","This species has declined as a result of hunting and egg collecting, wetland drainage for agriculture and deforestation. Habitat conversion by large-scale economic land concessions was recently identified as the greatest threat to the species (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Clearance of very large areas of lowland dry forest, including parts of the Northern Plains (Preah Vihear Protected Forest, Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary) and other areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Siem Pang IBA, Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary, O Ya Dao Protected Forest [Loveridge and Ty 2015]) where the species occurs has already taken place for conversion to agro-industrial uses including rubber, cassava, wood pulp and teak plantations. Small-scale agricultural expansion for subsistence agriculture is also considered a threat (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Generally the human population is increasing within the range of this species mostly through immigration from other provinces in Cambodia, resulting in more infrastructure and development projects that contribute to forest loss. Subsequent expansion of agricultural land and increasing hunting  pressure and disturbance at feeding sites is causing the loss of  breeding habitat for the species (An Dara 2008, Clements <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>in prep.). Construction of new roads through Siem Pang and Seima Protected Forest threaten the species's habitat and potentially expose it to increased disturbance (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Construction of hydroelectric dams in the upper Mekong tributaries (Lower Se San 2 Dam and Lower Sre Pok 2 Dam) could lead to the loss of suitable habitat along the Srepok and Sesan rivers (Loveridge and Ty 2015). <br/><br/>It relies on seasonal pools (<em>trapaengs</em>), which in the past were perhaps maintained by the now much depleted megafauna.&#160;The species appears to be very sensitive to human disturbance<strong></strong>  (An Dara 2008, Wright <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ty 2013), particularly during the dry season when both birds and  humans are concentrated around available waterholes rendering much  apparently suitable habitat unusable. The frequency of burning in deciduous dipterocarp forest has recently increased, potentially having a negative impact on food resources for the species (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Suitable nesting trees may be removed by commercial timber extraction operations or for subsistence housing construction, resulting in the species having to use suboptimal nesting trees (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Nest predation by Common Palm Civet <em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus </em>and/or Yellow-throated Marten <em>Martes flavigula</em> on two occasions in 2004 suggest that loss of nestlings to mammalian carnivores might be a significant constraint on breeding success <strong></strong>(Keo 2008), a theory supported by a study which found that the number of young fledged per nest was 50% higher for protected nests <strong></strong>(Keo <em>et al.</em> 2009). A prolonged drought in the 2009-2010 dry season appeared to dramatically lower the breeding success of Giant Ibis, by approximately 50%; climate change may therefore pose an additional long-term threat to the persistence of this species (H. Rainey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012).<p></p>",An assessment of the global population was made in 2014 based on newly collected data and expert opinion (including estimates of 48 and 35 mature individuals at the highest density sites) (Loveridge and Ty 2015). The population was estimated at a minimum of 194 mature individuals which is equivalent to approximately 290 individuals.,Decreasing,"The species is mostly confined to northern and eastern&#160;<strong>Cambodia</strong>, where it is probably still fairly widespread but extremely rare; with a few birds from the same population observed in extreme southern <strong>Lao PDR</strong>&#160;(BirdLife International 2001). It has also been recorded from Yok Don National Park, <strong>Viet Nam </strong>(Anon 2003), with the most recent sighting of a single bird in 2011 (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Its historical range spanned southern Viet Nam and south-eastern and peninsular Thailand, where it is now extinct. <br/><br/>Available data suggest that it has a patchy distribution across Cambodia <strong></strong>(T. Clements <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt. </em>2007). Some areas of high density exist in the Northern Plains, including Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary (with 30-40 nests monitored annually [T. Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012] and 24 pairs monitored in 2014 [WCS 2014 in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) and&#160;Prey Siem Pang Khang Lech Wildlife Sanctuary (formerly Western Siem Pang IBA) (where a slight decline has been detected from around 40 pairs [H. Wright<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2012] to 49±10 individuals in 2014 [Ty <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016]). Other areas appear to have relatively low density populations, which may be clustered in some cases: Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary&#160;(approximately 10-15 pairs [Sum and Bou 2012]), Seima Protection Forest (estimated at five pairs [T. Evans, H. Rainey, R. Vann and H. Wright&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012 in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) (WCS/FA 2006,&#160;Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007), Mondulkiri Protected Forest (anecdotal reports suggest a population of approximately 50 individuals [Gray personal communication in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) (T. Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> per T. Evans) and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (estimated at five pairs&#160;[T. Evans, H. Rainey, R. Vann and H. Wright&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012 in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) (Claassen and Ou 2007,&#160;T. Clements <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt. </em>2007, T. Clements <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>in prep.). <br/><br/>Additional recent records have come from Veunsai proposed Protected Forest in Ratanakiri Province (estimated at five pairs [T. Evans, H. Rainey, R. Vann and H. Wright <em>in litt</em>. 2012 in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) and the first observation south of Tonle Sap Lake since the 1920s was made by camera trap in 2011 (L. Perlman per T. Evans<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span>, Hance 2012). Further surveys may confirm other localities in suitable areas such as O Ya Dao Protected Forest (although the majority of suitable habitat in this area has now been converted to economic land concessions [Loveridge and Ty 2015]) and the unprotected areas west of Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (T. Evans <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Owing to large scale habitat loss the species's range is likely to have decreased between 2008 and 2015 (Loveridge and Ty 2015).<br/>  <p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong>The species was listed as Critically Endangered in Cambodia by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 2007 and hunting of the species was prohibited in Cambodia in 1994&#160;(Loveridge and Ty 2015). A 10-year Giant Ibis National Action Plan was published in 2015 (Loveridge and Ty 2015). The plan aims are that by 2025 the Giant Ibis population will be stable or increasing and the species will inhabit a network of well-protected sites. These objectives will be achieved via three channels: 1) protecting key habitat where the species is present; 2) implementing management interventions to increase survival and breeding success; 3) conducting research to inform conservation actions. The delivery of these activities will be monitored by the Ibis Working Group which is currently being established (Loveridge and Ty 2015).<br/><br/>Actions are ongoing to protect the species's breeding and foraging habitats. The Forestry Administration and Ministry of Environment in Cambodia are working to strengthen protected area management at key sites for the species, with support from organisations including Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity, BirdLife International, Conservation International, Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Wildlife Fund (Loveridge and Ty 2015). The entirety of the Western Siem Pang IBA has been designated as Wildlife Sanctuary, with the&#160;Prey Siem Pang Lech Wildlife Sanctuary forming the southwestern area of 65,389 ha., and the northern half (66,932 ha) upgraded from Protected Forest to Wildlife Sanctuary in the same decree on 9th May 2016 (BirdLife International Preventing Extinctions Programme, unpublished report).&#160;It occurs at least seasonally in Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA) and Dong Khanthung proposed NBCA, Laos, and Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Preah Vihear Protected Forest, Kulen Prumptep Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest in Cambodia. Ecotourism projects in the Northern Plains landscape (Tmatboey, O Koki and Prey Veng) and certified wildlife-friendly ""Ibis Rice"", sold for a premium, also benefits the species through restricting small-scale habitat conversion. Restoration of foraging habitats around waterholes is being trialled.<br/><br/>Management to improve breeding success currently involves targeted actions to protect nests and engaging with local communities. Ongoing community nest protection activities are taking place in the Northern Plains (Clements <em>et al. </em>2013), where&#160;local community members are paid to protect Giant Ibis and other waterbird nests. This not only removes a primary threat to the population, but instils local ownership and pride in the charismatic large waterbirds in this landscape. However there is some concern that additional people visiting the nest guardian may lead to additional disturbance. Giant Ibis is depicted on public awareness materials in Lao PDR and Cambodia as part of an on-going campaign to reduce hunting of large waterbirds. A predator-exclusion experiment in 2005-2006 found that nests with predator-exclusion devices (a smooth, hard plastic belt fixed around the base of the nest tree) were more likely to survive than those without (<strong></strong>Keo 2008). Such devices may alert hunters to the presence of nest sites and must be combined with community engagement work to deter hunting (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Work to improve habitat by deepening <em>trapaengs </em>has taken place at 19 of the water holes so far to early 2018 through the implementation of Species Guardian action and funding via the Darwin Initiative and Fondation Segre.&#160;<br/><br/>Monitoring is undertaken to assess the effectiveness of actions designed to benefit the species. Reproductive success is assessed through direct monitoring of breeding pairs whilst important populations are surveyed during the dry season (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Changes in forest cover are monitored using remote-sensing techniques (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Following the discovery of an individual in the Kampong Som Valley in Koh Kong Province, Cambodia, Wildlife Alliance plan to survey the area for breeding Giant Ibises (Hance 2012).<br/><br/>'Giant Ibis Transport' took on the role of Species Champion in 2013, agreeing  to provide $51,000 of funding over a three year period (Sartori 2013). It was nominated as the national bird of Cambodia in 2005 (Loveridge and Ty 2015).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Key actions as identified by the Giant Ibis National Action Plan are: to establish protected areas around key habitat for the species; at the site level, implement conservation actions designed to benefit the species and list the species as a conservation priority at these sites; improve law enforcement; encourage sustainable management of forest resources; provide support to local communities to reduce overexploitation of key habitat for the species (Loveridge and Ty 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Improved commitment to conserve protected areas in Cambodia is required by all stakeholders to stabilise the Giant Ibis population. Advocacy with the Cambodian government to raise the profile of the ecological needs of Cambodia’s national bird will help improve protection of the large undisturbed areas of deciduous dipterocarp forest that this species requires. Establish further protected areas encompassing large tracts of habitat found to support populations of the species, including strict protection of suitable permanent wetlands, especially in the dry season. At key sites, designate some suitable pools as for use only by wildlife. Ensure some pools remain wet during the dry season (e.g. by preventing people from draining them for fishing, and also potentially managing pools to increase their depth)&#160;<strong></strong>(Keo 2008). Restore foraging habitat. Protect and install anti-predator belts on all nest-trees and work with community groups to deter hunting behaviour (belts around trees may attract hunters to the species's nesting trees) (Loveridge and Ty 2015).&#160;Consolidate and promote further public awareness initiatives to reduce hunting of large waterbirds and wetland disturbance.<br/><br/>Conduct further surveys to locate and quantify remaining populations in Laos and Cambodia (particularly undersurveyed areas such as Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary [planned for 2018], Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Mekong Bird Nest Protection site near Kratie [Loveridge and Ty 2015]). Investigate its breeding requirements (including breeding season foraging ecology), demography and seasonal movements.&#160;Assess longer-term risk from climate change (T. Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).

Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2006), and may also nest in&#160;<em>Terminalia myriocarpa</em><em>&#160;</em>(G. Maheswaran <em>in litt. </em>2016). Four nests located in Bhutan in 2003-2007 were solitary and located in large Chir pines on ridges or steep slopes at 500-1,500 m, near the confluence of a small forest stream with a larger river (Pradhan 2007, Pradhan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Nesting took place in March-early June, and individuals then moved up to 30 km to feed on sand bars in large braided river systems in winter (Pradhan 2007, Pradhan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). <p></p>","The main threats are presumed to be widespread loss, degradation and disturbance of forest and wetlands. The species is also very sensitive to human disturbance, for example it took 48 hours for a pair to return to their breeding site following a disturbance (Mondal and Maheswaran 2014). Wetlands have become degraded as a result of pollution, rapid growth of aquatic vegetation, and the over-exploitation of resources. Increasing disturbance and habitat degradation from settlement, conversion to agriculture, harvesting of wetland resources and, more locally, poaching are thought to present significant threats in key protected areas (e.g. Namdapha National Park) in north-east India, Bhutan and Myanmar (W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Natural forest fires have destroyed nests in Bhutan. In Bhutan, hydroelectric dam developments as well as road improvements have resulted in significant habitat degradation, and can affect heron populations (Price and Goodman 2015).

The first confirmed record of this species in China was made in 2014 in Lushui County, Yunnan Province on the border with Myanmar (S. Chan <em>in litt</em>. 2014). It may also occur in south-east Tibet, China, but is now extinct in Nepal. Birds may visit the Brahmaputra lowlands in winter. Although historical reports suggest it was previously common in Myanmar, it has evidently declined throughout its range given the paucity of recent records. Most of the few recent records come from sites in Assam and&#160;Namdapaha in&#160;Arunachal Pradesh, India (Maheswaran 2007, A. Choudhury <em>in litt. </em>2016), a few sites in Bhutan, and parts of Myanmar. In Bhutan, there is a small population of 30 known individuals (with six juveniles) as of July 2007 (Pradhan 2007), with the total national population unlikely to exceed 50 individuals (Pradhan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The birds were observed along the Phochu, confluence of Phochu-Mochu, Punatsangchhu, Kamechu (Digchu), Zawa, Ngagshina and Burichu confluence (Pradhan 2007), with another recent sighting along the Drangmechhu River (Wangdi <em>et al. </em>2017). Six active nests were recorded in Bhutan in 2007, two from a new site, and by 26 July 2007 they held six chicks in total. Due to natural forest fires, three nests were abandoned. &#160;A further three active nests with five chicks were recorded in 2009, although only three chicks remained on a subsequent visit (Anon 2009)<strong></strong>. Six breeding sites from two rivers of central Bhutan have been recorded, and the eastern part of the country has not been thoroughly surveyed (Pradhan <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>2007)<strong></strong>.

White-bellied Heron has been recorded along rivers elsewhere in Kachin State, such as the Nam Sam Chaung, although little is known about its status in these areas<strong> </strong>(A. W.

Despite an increase in survey effort within the species's range in Myanmar there has been no corresponding increase in the number of records and the species was apparently absent from large areas of suitable habitat (J.

In north-east India, a few individuals are regularly seen in Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh (Maheswaran 2007). Up to six individuals were recorded in Namdapha Tiger Reserve in January 2014, this was followed by a breeding pair at the same location in March 2014, a first for India (Mondal and Maheswaran 2014). The nest observers had to leave the area before they were able to confirm whether the pair had successfully raised a brood, however a second visit was planned for July-August 2014. Further nest building was noted at this site in 2015, though nesting appeared to fail following a storm (G. Maheswaran <em>in litt. </em>2016). Records from other sites are sporadic and there are no recent sightings from a number of former sites including Jamjing Reserved Forest, Dibru-Saikhowa National Park,&#160;Kaziranga National Park, Nameri National Park&#160;and Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary (A.

In Myanmar, a small population occurs within the Hukaung Tiger Reserve<strong> </strong>(A. W. Tordoff <em>in litt</em>. 2006), and Hpon Razi Wildlife Sanctuary. A project studying White-bellied Heron began in Bhutan in 2003, and is run in conjunction with the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature, the World Wildlife Fund, the Felburn Foundation and the International Crane Foundation.&#160;A three-year study on the foraging ecology of the species has been undertaken in Namdpaha, Arunachal Pradesh&#160;and the results are awaited (G. Maheswaran&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;Recognising the importance of the riverbed in Punakha-Wangdue as a primary feeding ground for this species, the Royal Government of Bhutan has declared the area as protected habitat for White-bellied Herons. In May 2011, a White-bellied Heron was hatched in captivity for the first time (Tshewang Norbu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011), and in September 2011 it was released at Bumitsawa, Pochu, Punakha, in Bhutan, having been already tagged with a satellite transmitter (<a href=""http://www.rspnbhutan.org"">www.rspnbhutan.org</a>). Following the success of this a captive breeding centre is being built (RSPN 2017).

An investigation into the use of automatic pattern recognition software in acoustic monitoring was undertaken for the species in Nepal, which may enable remote monitoring of this highly sensitive species.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct extensive surveys for the species in north-east India, Myanmar and also south-east Tibet, to establish its distribution, population status and ecological requirements, particularly in breeding areas. Research from Bhutan suggests the Kurichu and Mangdechu basins could support suitable habitat for this species and these areas should also be surveyed (Anon. 2012). Support proposals to provide more effective protection for Namdapha National Park, including creation of buffer zones. Support requests to maintain habitat and minimise disturbance along the Manas river and around Ada lake, Bhutan. Initiate conservation awareness programmes in areas supporting populations, particularly in Myanmar and north-east India, using it as a flagship species. Consider satellite tagging individuals to improve current understanding of the species's movements and habitat preferences<strong> </strong>(J. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2006).

142404453,55997072,Cervus elaphus,Least Concern,,2018,2015-10-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,This species is listed as Least Concern due to a wide distribution and presumed large populations. There have been range contractions and presumably population declines in some parts of the species' range but it is not believed to approach the threshold for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in three generations). Genetic mixing as a result of introductions of deer from different areas is a problem that should be addressed.,"It inhabits open deciduous woodland, mixed deciduous-coniferous and coniferous woodland, upland moors and open mountainous areas (sometimes above the treeline), Mediterranean maquis scrub, natural grasslands, pastures and meadows (Koubek and Zima 1999). It prefers broadleaved woodland interspersed by large meadows. In woodland, its diet consists mainly of shrub and tree shoots, but in other habitats it also consumes grasses, sedges and shrubs. Fruit and seeds are important in autumn. <br/><br/>Generally found in mountainous regions, where it spends summers in alpine meadows and winters in valleys. On more level terrain, seeks wooded hillsides in summer, open grasslands in winter. In west central Asia it occurs in woody and shrubby thickets along riverbanks in desert areas (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011).<br/><br/>Found up to 2,800 asl on the Alps. Animals come lower into valleys in winter. They live in small herds of females and young, gathering into larger herds in winter. Stags live singly or form all male herds in summer, but gather harems in rut season in late summer, without obvious territories. Natural lifespan is about 15 years, but a captive animal lived up to almost 27 years. Calving peaks in May-June following a gestation of 235 days. Females drop single calves in late spring. Females are sexually and socially mature at 1.5-2.5 years. Males attain sexual maturity as yearlings but they continue growing until at least 6 years of age and cannot compete for females with other males until then, by which time they reach social maturity.","The main threat is the intermixing of the various subspecies, Asia to Europe and vice versa, including with <em>C. canadensis</em> from North America (Wapiti) and, as well as hybridisation with Sika <em>Cervus nippon</em> (Koubek and Zima 1999). The introduction of animals from North America to Europe has also resulted in the spread of parasites and diseases to previously unaffected subpopulations (e.g. liver worms). In many areas hunting is strictly regulated on this species and harvests are used to control population growth as large predators have been removed or ""controlled"" over much of the range. Overhunting and habitat loss and fragmentation as a result of agricultural intensification and urbanisation are other pressures in some areas and for some subspecies, but they are not thought to pose a major threat to the species at present.<br/><br/>In the former USSR, the species is heavily poached for food, and settlement, stock grazing (Petocz 1973). In Algeria and Tunisia, the species has declined due to overhunting, particularly during the Algerian War, and habitat degradation destruction and direct mortality from anthropogenic forest fires (DSG 1988). In Corsica and Sardinia, <em>C. e. corsicanus</em> declined as a result of hunting (Dolan 1988), similar to <em>C. e. maral</em> and <em>C. e. brauneri</em> in the Caucasus and Crimea.<br/><br/>The Mesola Red Deer <em>C. e. italicus</em> is highly threatened and prone to inbreeding depression. Habitat improvement and reduction of competition with Fallow Deer has helped this subspecies, the establishment of additional populations is recommended with exchanges of animals between them to maintain genetic diversity and minimise the effects of inbreeding (Zachos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). A National Conservation Plan for the conservation of Mesola Red Deer has been developed (Lovari and Nobili 2010).","It is a widespread and abundant species across much of its current range, although there is increasing fragmentation of populations in northern Africa and central Europe, and the species has been lost from some areas. In all Europe excluding Russia, the species numbered 1.25 million individuals in 1985 and 2.4 million in 2005. Densities are typically 1-5 individuals per km², sometimes up to 15 individuals per km² (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011). The annual harvest grew in the same period from 270,000 to 500,000 individuals. In Germany there are reports of 60,000 animals hunted per year. The most recent records indicate a population size of 150,000-180,000 in Germany (M. Stubbe pers. comm. 2006). The species has been extirpated in historical times from Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan. <br/><br/>In Russia, approximately 500 purebred <em>C. elaphus </em>(<em>C. e. hippelaphu</em>s) are estimated to occur in Voronezskii Zapovednik. Animals from here were translocated to European Russia, simultaneously with <em>C. e. sibiricus</em>, hybrid animals from Askania-Nova and Sika <em>Cervus nippon</em>, so the rest of the animals in European Russia (an estimated 20,000 individuals) cannot be considered pure <em>C. elaphus</em> (O. Pereladova pers. comm). Outside of European Russia, native populations number approximately 3,000 individuals (O. Pereladova pers. comm.). <em>C. e. maral</em> seriously declined in the Russian part of the Caucasus in the1990s but has recovered slightly since 2,000 although it is still seriously threatened. In Georgia and other parts of the Caucasus it is very rare. There are no data on <em>C. e. brauneri</em> from the Crimean Peninsula but it is thought to be very rare (O. Pereladova pers. comm.).<br/><br/><em>C.e.corsicanus</em>, and <em>C.e.barbarus</em> remain rare. <em>C. e. corsicanus</em> underwent a dramatic decline disappearing from Corsica in 1969 and decreasing to circa 100 individuals in Sardinia in 1970. The subspecies recovered slowly in Sardinia, numbering 8,000 animals in 2014 and in 1985 a reintroduction programme was started in Corsica (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011). <br/><br/>Populations in Northern Africa have been increasingly declining. In Algeria, <em>C. e. barbarus</em> persists in the Annaba, Bouchegouf, and El-Kala regions, where it is restricted to the Beni-Salah, Ben Abed, and El-Kala forests (DSG 1988). The total number of animals in the mid-1970s was reported to be 400–600 (Halisse 1975), and by the late 1980s reached around 2,000 animals (Dolan 1988, de Smet 1989). However, the population has been in a sharp decline since (K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007). In Tunisia, the population was reported to have expanded considerably during the 1970s, with populations known in El Feidja, Ain Draham, and Tabarka regions (DSG 1988). The total population of ten animals in 1961 had increased to around 2,000 by the late 1980s. Much of this increase is attributed to the success of the 1966 reintroduction protection program at El Feidja, which has resulted in colonization of an approx. 100 km length of coastal Tunisia (Dolan 1988). A survey in 2006 showed that population levels were significantly lower than estimated before. In Morocco it went extinct in the early 20th century (by 1932). During the first half of the 20th century, Spanish deer were introduced to northern Morocco from the royal estate of El Pardo (Madrid) (Lehmann 1969).There have more recently been reintroductions into two enclosures but wild populations have not yet become established (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>A regional assessment has been completed for this species as part of the European Mammal Assessment (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/ema/), which offers more details on European occupances, populations and threats.",Increasing,"The Red Deer has a distribution extending from Europe into North Africa and the Middle East (Corbet 1978, Koubek and Zima 1999, Wilson and Ruff 1999, Wilson and Mittermeier 2011). It is widely but somewhat patchily distributed throughout most of continental Europe, although it is absent from northern Fennoscandia and largely from much of Russia, except Voronez in northern Russia, the Crimean Peninsula and the Caucasus, where it extends into Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. It is present on a number of islands, including the British Isles and Sardinia. Whether the Red Deer is native to Ireland or introduced is still under debate (Carden <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011). In Ireland Red Deer became locally extinct at the end of the Pleistocene but were reintroduced by humans from Scotland during the Neolithic period. The only population descended from this early introduction is within Killarney, County Kerry. All other populations were introduced during the 19th century from outside of Ireland. (Carden <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). It became extinct on Corsica in 1970 but was reintroduced in 1985 from Sardinia. Apart from Mesola Wood (Po river delta), all the continental populations of Italy became extinct in historic times and were replaced by new stocks of foreign origin (Toschi 1965, Mattioli 1990, Mattioli <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Breber and Masseti 2007); in Sardinia the species did not belong to the fossiliferous horizons of the Upper Pleistocene and did not appear before the end of the 7th millennium BC (Masseti and Vianello 1991, Vigne 1992). On the small island of Lampedusa (Italy), in the Sicilian Channel, a population of deer possibly referable to <em>C. elaphus corsicanus</em> survived between the last part of the 18th and the first half of the following century (Masseti and Zava 2002). It is extinct in Albania. In Greece, the small isolated subpopulations are the result of reintroductions into areas where it previously occurred. The last native population of Greek Red Deer is supposed to have survived in the Sithonia peninsula (Chalkidiki, north-eastern Greece) where it became extinct in the 1980s (Masseti 2012 and references therein). Likewise in Portugal all populations result from reintroduction or natural expansion from transborder Spanish populations which in turn were reintroduced. It occurs from sea level to above the tree line (<em>c.</em> 3,000 m) in the Alps. The distribution is much more patchy and fragmented than the apparent continuity suggested by the distribution map. <br/><br/>In Africa it is found in the Atlas Mountains of NE Algeria and NW Tunisia and Morocco (reintroduced since 1989). It is in the Near and Middle East in Turkey, N Iran, and Iraq, but extinct in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.",,Terrestrial,"It is protected under Appendix III of the Bern Convention. Subspecies <em>C. e. corsicanus</em> is strictly protected under Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annexes II* and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. It occurs in numerous protected areas across its range and also in protected areas outside its range where it has been introduced. To preserve the genetic integrity of local populations, it is important that the introduction of red deer from other areas is stopped, unless there is evidence that they belong to the same taxon (subspecies).<br/><br/>Red Deer in Europe have been affected to a large extent by translocations not only between far distant populations and different subspecies within the continent, but also by translocations of deer within the same regions with admixture of different 'park deer' of various mixed stock with wild ranging deer of 'pure' stock, and also by imported conspecifics from Central Asia and of <em>C. canadensis</em> from North America, and introduced Sika (Niedzialkowska <em>et al.</em> 2011, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2014, McDevitt <em>et al.</em> 2009, McDevitt and Zachos 2014, Zachos and Hartl 2011). As a result, most of the present deer populations of Europe are either known hybrids on a subspecific or even specific level or their breeding background is insufficiently known for excluding such a possibility. Systematic investigation into the history and the genetics of all European Red Deer populations is therefore needed as a base for establishing a European Red Deer Management Plan. Part of this plan should be the identification of unpolluted autochthonous populations of this species and protection of their genetic integrity, thus preserving as much as possible of what is left of its natural variation. The development of stable meta-population networks by developing corridors and habitat connectivity will be important to ensure the viability of populations of Red Deer in the future (Zachos and Hartl 2011).<br/><br/>Populations from Algeria and Tunisia are listed on CITES Appendix III.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Individuals were found among leaves, under logs, and within bromeliads (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is not likely to tolerate habitat disturbance (J. Townsend pers. comm.

Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).","Cerro Ulloa is deforested up to and above 1,500 m asl on the southern slopes (Townsend <em>et al.</em> 2013). In 2013, it was estimated that there was 300 ha of intact cloud forest surrounding the type locality, but it is presumed to have diminished since (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). It is threatened by migratory agriculture and cattle ranching, and indirectly by an increase in international narcotrafficking in adjacent portions of Colón and Olancho (Townsend <em>et al.</em> 2013). There is also a major mining concession granted within the park boundaries, which faces intense local opposition and threatens the integrity of the remaining habitat on the northern slopes (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). Forest clearing and fires were continuous during the two night trip for the collection of the type series (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). From satellite imagery, there appears to be another patch of forest in the park between <em>ca</em> 1,500-1,600 m asl that may support this species, but surveys are needed to verify this (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><strong><br/></strong>Climate change is also considered to be a threat. Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabitat a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Honduras (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).","It is only known from four specimens (Townsend 2016). The population status is unknown as there have been no surveys since the collection of the type series, due to safety concerns of visiting the area (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). Based on the small patches of forest available within the species range,&#160;it is possible that the global population is fewer than 250 mature individuals, with 90-100% individuals occurring in a single subpopulation. Due to ongoing decline in the extent and quality of habitat, the population is suspected to be decreasing.",Decreasing,"This species is only known from the vicinity of its type locality on Cerro Ulloa in&#160;Parque Nacional Montaña de Botaderos, Olancho Department, Honduras, between 1,705-1,720 m asl (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2013).

The species is currently extirpated from the Indus, Irrawaddy and most rivers and tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra-Meghna systems, but persists in fourteen sites within the Ganges drainage (6 major and 8 minor), with confirmed breeding at only five locations (Table 1 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Surveys and counts in 2010-2017 indicate an adult global metapopulation conservatively estimated at 650 (median) with a range of 300-900.&#160; The largest and most populous location, the protected National Chambal Sanctuary in north India, spans 625 river km, with approximately 500 mature adults, comprising 77% of the global total, producing &gt;410 nests annually, or &gt;86% of the global total.&#160; Five other locations reporting breeding are small and highly disturbed.&#160; The remaining 8 minor locations together contain less than 10% of the world population (&lt;50 mature adults), with no recent breeding.

Cause of declines have been principally dams and barrages disrupting river hydrology, mortality in fishing nets, and historically, unregulated hide-hunting. Current serious threats include major water control and extraction activities, mortality in fishing gear, and increased anthropogenic river-bank disruptions, especially sand mining and boulder removal.&#160; These threats are known, continuing and not reversible, therefore criterion A2 applies. The expansion of threats and major declines have intensified since the 1950s, and continue presently with increasing demand for river resources.<br/><br/>Past population levels are inferred to be &gt;20,000 adult gharial globally.&#160; Calculating across the range of current and past population estimates, exponential declines are 94% or greater.

The species does not meet criteria E.</p>","<p>The gharial is a river dwelling crocodilian (Whitaker and Basu 1983) with adult gharial showing widespread use of river systems with seasonal migratory behaviours and social hierarchies (Lang and Kumar 2013, 2016). Gharials congregate for mating and nesting during the dry season in these highly seasonal, monsoonal rivers. &#160;Courting and mating occurs in mid–February followed by nesting and egg-laying in mid–March to early–April. Female gharial nest in seasonally exposed sandbanks along slow moving sections of medium- to large-sized rivers, and lay an average of 40 eggs. When concentrated in these areas, gharial are highly vulnerable to impacts from fishing and malicious killing. The eggs are also vulnerable because in some areas they are sought for food/medicine. Incubation takes 2-2.5 months with mostly females guarding nest sites. &#160;Hatching occurs in late May through mid-June. &#160;Adult care is well-documented. Females open the nests at the time of hatching but do not transport the young to the water. &#160;Hatchlings from multiple nests aggregate in crèches numbering from hundreds to a thousand or more.&#160; Females, and typically a single large male, guard hatchling crèches from potential predators for 1-2 months. Once monsoon waters start to rise, the guarding adults make long distance seasonal movements, and the crèches break up with hatchlings dispersing widely into aquatic shoreline habitats.&#160; Adult gharial are seasonal migrants in large, open river drainages, with movements of 50-200+ km recorded in Chambal. Upon release, non-resident, captive-reared individuals appear highly mobile, and some have moved in excess of 1,000 km. </p>  <p>In the Chambal subpopulation, most large females nest every year (reproductive frequency &gt;90%; Thorbjarbnarson 1996, Lang and Kumar 2016). Similar values appear to apply to other subpopulations, e.g. Katerniaghat subpopulation, but may not apply to the most northerly subpopulation, e.g. at Chitwan. The Nepalese subpopulations may show higher rates of biennial nesting.</p>  <p>A number of gharial subpopulations now exist in lentic, rather than lotic, environments, principally in reservoirs behind dams and/or barrages, formed in flooded water courses that were formerly river channels. These include the Katerniaghat subpopulation and the Corbett subpopulation.&#160; The Chitwan subpopulation is possibly impacted by the Tribeni Dam on the Gandak (=Narayani) River, but the distances between gharial concentrations and the dams in all three locations vary.&#160; Saikia <em>et al. </em>(2010) sighted gharial at natural lake localities on the Brahmaputra drainage, with presence confirmed by local inhabitants.&#160; A gharial photographed by local forest department staff, was caught there and translocated into a permanent channel (Saikia 2012).</p>  <p>Additional references on gharial habitats and ecology are noted in Groombridge (1982), Maskey (1989), Rao<em> et al. </em>(1995), Wildlife Institute of India (1999), Choudhury <em>et al. </em>(2007) and Stevenson (2015).&#160; </p>","<p><span class=""datalabel1""><strong>Dams and Barrages</strong>: Major water control structures, including dams, barrages (=low, gated diversion dams) and related constructions, have been detrimental to gharial distribution and abundance on all of the river drainages in which the species occurred. These structures resulted in serious habitat fragmentation and degradation. In freshwater systems, the extinction related to dam construction is not quantified nor understood, but apparently also affects freshwater dolphins (Braulik <em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1""> 2014, Paudel <em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1""> 2015, Braulik and Smith 2017). In the future, many dams and barrages are planned for major rivers and tributaries in areas where Gharials reside, or are suspected to remain, such as the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra. In this area recent studies predict major detrimental effects of hydropower and storage projects on the rich and diverse fishes inhabiting the Lohit river basin, a major Brahmaputra tributary (Kansal and Arora 2012). The relatively rapid disappearance and extirpation of the formerly common and abundant gharial in the Indus system is, perhaps, the best example of the magnitude and importance of this major threat to date (Lang 2018b). Rae (1933) notes unusual, high concentrations of gharial associated with new construction of a major barrage (Lloyd Barrage) on the Indus.&#160; He observed that local fishermen related such changes in gharial behaviour directly to newly closed dam gates trapping hundreds of gharial upstream, immediately following barrage construction. Dam construction on the Ramganga River, to create the Kalagarh Reservoir at Corbett National Park, involved extensive blasting, which caused gharial deaths. The formerly large numbers of gharial that frequented the deep pools, submerged by reservoir, were reduced to a few remnant individuals (Singh 1979). On the Narayani-Gandak River, when the Tribeni Dam was constructed on the Indo-Nepalese border, gharial distribution and abundance was altered, and fewer gharial frequented the areas despite previously being abundant (Maskey 1989). Irrigation and hydro projects on the Betwa River, a major Yamuna tributary, resulted in a marked reduction and eventual extinction of resident gharial (Singh 1979). On the Brahmani River in Odisha, east central India, dam construction also involved extensive blasting, killing many gharial, and eventually leading to the species’ extinction in this drainage (Singh and Bustard 1982). On the Kosi River in eastern Nepal, which flows into India and into the Ganges, the construction of the Kosi Barrage at the international border resulted in monsoonal flooding of upstream nests, and only allowed one-way downstream movements (Maskey 2008). In Nepal, Gharial no longer survive on the Kosi, despite numerous re-introduction attempts (Shah and Paudel 2016). In India, the Kosi was channelized in the 1970s, and embankments restricted river flow. As a consequence, hunting of Gharial increased, and numbers declined dramatically (Biswas 1970; Shahi 1974).&#160; Elsewhere in Nepal, dynamiting during bridge construction at Chisapani on the Karnali River resulted in declines in resident gharial in the Bardia National Park (Maskey 1989). </span><br/><br/><strong>Water Extraction /Irrigation</strong>: Lift stations on the Chambal threaten gharial survival because during the dry season, water flow and consequently river connectivity is greatly reduced. Such activities are illegal, but persist despite restrictive legislation and regulations (Hussain <em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1""> 2011; Nair 2017).&#160; During the last 20 years, the flow regime of the Chambal River has shown a declining trend and continued water withdrawal will negatively impact available riverine habitats important to the gharial in future years (Hussain <em>et al </em><span class=""datalabel1"">2011). Water management programs adversely impacting gharial are now evident on the Son River (location L; Table 2) (Sharma <em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1""> 2011; Nair&#160;and Katdare 2013), and a more informed water management strategy will be needed to overcome them (Nair&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1"">&#160;2016). On the Chambal, there is a major upstream project proposed that would likely divert much of the remaining water now available to the Chambal main channel, via the Parbati and Kali Sindh tributaries upon which the Chambal relies for water flow during the dry season.&#160; On the lower Chambal, its recent declaration as National Waterway No. 24, a part of the development corridor across northern India, seriously threatens this river sanctuary (Nair 2017). Vegetation intrusion at the major nesting site at Katerniaghat impacts hatchling survival (G. Vashistha per. comm. 2018).</span></span><span class=""datalabel1""><br/><br/><strong>River Interlinking</strong>: The proposed Ganges-Brahmaputra inter-link canal and dam project, envisioned under the Indian National Waterways Act 2016, is intended to convert 111 reaches of 106 rivers to inland waterways for transport of cargo, coal, industrial raw materials, and for tourism, without government seeking environmental approvals for bulk of the waterways (Hindustan Times 2018). The cumulative effects of these projects will severely affect the remaining extant populations of gharial which persist in the few remaining remnants of natural riverine habitat, presently under governmental and legal sanctions as protected areas, etc. Previously, the completion of the Farakka Barrage on the lower Ganges in 1974, coupled with the construction of at least 19 other barrages and 18 high dams in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna system since 1957, resulted in major impediments to seasonal migratory movements throughout the system, and dramatic declines in the quantities and qualities of riverine habitats available to Gharial and Ganges River Dolphins (Braulik and Smith 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Mortality in Fishing Nets/Gear</strong>: As legal and illegal net fishing, especially with monofilament gill nets, has intensified in large rivers, gharial losses to entrapment are increasing. Data on mortality rates due to net fishing are scarce, but observations on the Chambal and Yamuna over the past decade indicate the gharials most vulnerable are young animals, primarily juveniles and sub adults, despite some large mature adults occasionally getting caught.&#160; Net related mortality is the main cause of adult losses in the Ken and Son Rivers. In 2016, on the Son River, two adult males died after being entangled in fishing nets (Nair 2017). In the Chitwan subpopulation in Nepal, one of the few resident adult breeding males was caught and drowned in a fishing net (Lang 2017). On the Chambal, fishing in the National Chambal Sanctuary is prohibited, but persists, especially in the lower reaches near the Yamuna confluence, and in the Yamuna stretches above and below the Chambal confluence. Young animals are susceptible to being caught in nets, and either drown or are killed or injured deliberately or accidentally. Older gharial appear to be “net savvy” and tend to not be captured in nets.&#160; Near the Yamuna confluence, gharial of all sizes with damaged snouts are more often encountered than elsewhere in the NCS.<br/><br/><span class=""datalabel1""><strong>Sand Mining and Boulder Collection</strong>: Sand mining removes critical riverside substrate for nesting.&#160; Increasing and widespread development has resulted in high demand for sand for construction purposes. Sand removal operates on an industrial scale at some localities on the Chambal River, and also on the Ken and Son Rivers, as well as at unprotected minor locations where gharial still survive. In Nepal, boulder removal in addition to sand mining continue on unprotected stretches of river adjacent to and within both Chitwan and Bardia National Parks. Sand mining continues at a number of Gharial localities, and has widespread and detrimental effects on wildlife directly, as well as on the integrity and lateral connectivity of these important riverine habitats (Vagholikar and Moghe 2003; Taigor and Rao 2008, 2010a, 2010b; Nair&#160;</span><span class=""datalabel1"">and Katdare 2013, 2014b; Nair 2017; Lang and Kumar 2013, 2016; Rao <em>et al. </em><span class=""datalabel1"">2016; Nair 2017).<br/><br/></span><span class=""datalabel1""><strong>Introduced Species</strong>: Exotic fish species are now established and common in the Yamuna-Chambal system. Feral, exotic <em>Tilapia</em> species are now the most abundant fish in sample catches at multiple stations on the lower Yamuna (Ganie <em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1""> 2013; Singh <em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1""> 2014). Although <em>Tilapia </em>were suggested to be a major contributor to the mass die off of gharial in 2007-08, there is scant evidence to support this suggestion (Stevenson 2015), despite the fact that this species is known to contain high levels of &#160;industrial effluents and pollutants in Yamuna waters (Laxmi <em>et al. </em><span class=""datalabel1"">2015). A preliminary study in the NCS identified the dominant species of <em>Tilapia</em><span class=""datalabel1""> to be <em>T. mossambicus</em><span class=""datalabel1""> and fish from the upper Chambal were in better body condition than those collected in the lower Yamuna (Rainwater <em>et al. </em><span class=""datalabel1"">2009). Downstream, the dominant tilapia species is<em> T. niloticus </em><span class=""datalabel1"">(Dwivedi <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2016) although both species are found. Monsoon observations by Gharial Ecology Project researchers indicate that there are regular, seasonal concentrations of Gharial (&gt; 50+), primarily adults and large sub adults, assembled at the confluence of the Yamuna-Chambal rivers for feeding when currents and water levels are conducive. The dominant fish being caught and consumed by Gharials participating in these feeding aggregations is tilapia, and typically many fish are consumed by individual animals, on any given day when conditions are favourable (Lang and Kumar 2013, 2016, and unpublished observations). Elsewhere, the production of a strong male-bias in populations of the American Crocodile (<em>Crocodylus acutus</em><span class=""datalabel1"">) has been attributed to a novel environmental androgen added to fish feed (methyl testosterone) for rapid growth in <em>Tilapia</em> aquaculture operations adjacent to the natural riverine habitats of the affected crocodiles (Murray <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2017). The possible effects of <em>Tilapia</em> consumption, a relatively new food source for Chambal Gharial, have not yet been studied, but may be noteworthy, with reference to the recent mass die-off, as well as to environmental influences on sex determination (Lang and Andrews 1994, Andrews and Whitaker 2004), growth and overall health.<span class=""datalabel1""></span></span></span></span></span></span>  <br/></p><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""X-NONE""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""X-NONE""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","Historically, gharials were the most common river crocodylian within the species’ range, and were frequently mentioned in British India narratives describing river conditions in those areas, from the early 1800s into the 20th century (24 accounts 1834-1998 presented and discussed in Lang 2018c in press).<br/><br/>The species survives at 14 locations (Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Information), supplemented by releases of captive-reared juveniles, and an additional location where gharial appear to be successfully re-establishing themselves along a formerly occupied stretch of the Upper Ganges (Hastinapur; location O in Table 2 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Surveys for gharial are daytime counts, conducted at seasonally favourable times of year, either by boat or from riverside observation points (=stationary counts). Boat surveys result in counts 25-40% lower than stationary counts, which provides correction factors for adjusting boat counts and compensating for the two different survey methodologies (Nair <em>et al</em>. 2012, Chowfin and Leslie 2014, GEP 2017). Nest counts are made by observing the number of hatched nests at the end of the hatching period (mid-June), and adding these counts to direct observations of predated nests. Sighting counts of “adult female” (3-4 m in total length; no ghara visible) are potentially biased by sub-adult males (no ghara), and nest counts although biased by uncertainty about the proportion of adult females that nest annually, are a more conservative estimate within a subpopulation. With experienced observers, the variation in estimates is not great: on the Chambal River in the NCS, 442 adult females were estimated in early 2017 and in June 2017, ~420 nests were documented (GEP 2017, Khandal <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Major sites </strong>(six subpopulations; 1,100 km; ~600 mature adults in total): Five locations exhibit recent reproduction/recruitment and reproduction is likely at a sixth location (Babai River) in the future.<br/><br/><strong>Chambal subpopulation </strong>(A on Table 1 in the Supplementary Information): The single largest and most populous location, the protected National Chambal Sanctuary (NCS) in north India, spans 625 river km, and contains about 500 mature adults, based on recent, conservative survey estimates.&#160; This population comprises 77% (500/650) of the total global gharial population, with &gt;410 nests in 2017, or ~86% of the global nest total (&gt;410/475 nests).&#160; The Chambal subpopulation has been regularly surveyed since the 1980s, by boat counts on the stretches of river where gharial appear to live and nest year-round. Detailed nesting tallies on the lower Chambal are included in the Chambal Field Report (GEP 2017). The resident gharial in this population utilize the entire length of the 414 km of mainstream, from Pali (upstream) to Pachnada (downstream) throughout the year. In 2017, additional nests were located within the NCS protected Parvati River, an upstream tributary, joining the Chambal near Pali (Khandal <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; Nesting occurs at widely spaced sites up and down this length of protected river, changing locally every year with sandbank changes.<br/><br/>Despite the mass die-off in the winter of 2007-2008 of ~110 gharial, 2-4 m in total length, annual counts of basking gharial and nest counts have been stable and indicate an overall moderate increase in recent years in both indices.&#160; No comparable mass mortality has occurred subsequently (Nawab <em>et al</em>. 2013) and die-off details are discussed in Stevenson (2015). Releases of juveniles from a conservation ranching program are still occurring and typically result in 100-200 captive-reared animals per year being released. These programmed releases are largely unstructured, unstudied and the results are not monitored. The efficacy of such releases remains unknown, and the utility of continuing the Chambal release program has been questioned.&#160;&#160; In February 2018, juvenile gharial in the MPFD release program in the NCS, which were head-started at the Deori Eco-centre, were radio tracked upon release in the lower Chambal (Lang 2018a).<br/><br/>In comparison with other locations where gharial are still extant, the Chambal subpopulation has been relatively well-studied since the establishment of the National Chambal Sanctuary (NCS) in 1979.&#160; For decades, the Chambal River system has contained the largest, self-sustaining gharial population (Rao <em>et al</em>. 1995) and this region has been the focus of numerous ecological studies (Singh 1978, 1985; Whitaker and Basu 1983; Rao 1988; Hussain 1999, 2009; Katdare <em>et al</em>. 2011) and conservation landscape analyses (Hussain and Badola 2001). Annual surveys have been conducted (Sharma 1999, Sharma and Basu 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sharma and Dasgupta 2013), augmented by additional surveys (Katdare <em>et al</em>. 2011; Nair <em>et al</em>. 2012a, 2012b).&#160; Interactions between Mugger Crocodiles (<em>Crocodylus palustris) </em>and Gharial in the NCS, over a thirty year period (1984-2014), were reported by Sharma and Singh (2014). The Gharial Ecology Project, initiated in 2008 in response to the mass die-off on the lower Chambal, has documented long-distance seasonal migrations of 100-200+ km by adults, primarily nesting females, as well as complex social behaviours of adults and young, during the pre-monsoon hatch and post-hatch period (Lang and Kumar 2013, 2016; Khandal <em>et al</em>. 2017; Jailabdeen 2018; Singh <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Katerniaghat subpopulation </strong>(B on Table 1): The Katerniaghat subpopulation occupies a relatively small area, comprising about 20 km of river and reservoir shoreline, within a protected wildlife sanctuary that is part of Dudhwa National Park on the Indo-Nepal border in north central Uttar Pradesh.&#160; The Girwa River segment within it is inhabited by gharial, and is bounded downstream by the Kailashpuri Dam, a major barrage on the Ghaghara River into which the Girwa flows, and upstream by the international border with Nepal (=Geruwa River, in Nepal; eastern branch of the Karnali River). It flows from Nepal in the north into India.&#160; This location is currently estimated to contain approximately 50 mature adult gharial, 6-10 males and about 35 females.&#160; Nesting at Katerniaghat has been estimated at 24-35 nests per year, at four sites, of which the majority 22-25 are laid at one site where it is impacted by vegetation growth, and where hatchling mortality has been high in recent years.The Katerniaghat subpopulation has been studied in detail since the 1970s (Singh 1979, Srivastava 1981, Choudhary <em>et al</em>. 2017). This population has remained relatively constant since the last assessment (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2007), and is characterized by an annual reproductive output, in terms of number of nests, proportionate to the estimated number of mature females (30-35 females; 24-35 nests per year). Juvenile releases at this location apparently ceased after 2009, so the juveniles now in the population are presumably resulting from natural recruitment of successful <em>in situ</em> reproduction in this lotic reservoir habitat.<br/><br/>At the other major locations (C-F), extant gharial sub-populations vary in the number of mature adults estimated to inhabit each area, but the level of nesting does not appear to be commensurate with the number of mature females.&#160; Rather, in contrast to Chambal and Katerniaghat, annual reproduction appears to be limited at Chitwan in Nepal, on the Gandak River in Bihar, and at Corbett on the Ramganga River in north India. Recent nesting has not yet been documented at Babai River in Bardia National Park, but did apparently occur in the 1980s (DNPWC 2018). There is potential for nesting in this protected river segment, totally within park boundaries.<br/><br/><strong>Chitwan subpopulation</strong> (C on Table 1): The Chitwan subpopulation is estimated to be 40-60 mature adults, with few adult males (&lt;5 or less). At Chitwan, mature adults inhabit the Narayani and the East Rapti Rivers adjacent to the protected area, and have been recorded nesting along suitable stretches of both rivers within the last decade (Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). The number of nests found each year is relatively low, only 4 to 14 over the past decade. In most years, a majority of these nests have been removed for artificial incubation, and any resultant young were head-started by rearing in captivity for 5 to 10+ years (Archarya <em>et al</em>. 2017, Lang 2017b). Lower levels of nesting at Chitwan are enigmatic, but may be related to a lower reproductive frequency, e.g., biannual rather than annual nesting by females, or a recent scarcity of breeding males.<br/><br/><strong>Gandak subpopulation </strong>(D on Table 1): On the Gandak River (south of Chitwan in India), a separate subpopulation exists, and is fragmented into smaller groups of individuals living in a largely unprotected, riverine habitat extending over 300+ km. On the basis of recent surveys on the Gandak between Tribeni Dam on the Indo-Nepalese border and the Gandak-Ganges confluence near Patna, the resident gharial are widely dispersed, but do aggregate, primarily in the upstream 100-200 km of the river (Nair and Katdare 2014a). Although the Narayani-Gandak River is contiguous across the border, these subpopulations are treated as separate entities because there is limited exchange, especially in upstream direction, due to the water control structures on the border. In 2016, six nests were laid at a site 100 km downstream from protected habitat at the Indo-Nepal border, with successful hatching.&#160; However, in 2017, no nests were recorded, after early nesting attempts were interrupted when water was released at the upstream barrage (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2016; WTI 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Corbett subpopulation </strong>(E in Table 1): At Corbett National Park, gharial have been living in the Kalagarh Reservoir, occupying an approximate area 3,500-4,000ha with 32 km of shoreline habitat. Recent estimates of mature adults indicate a total of ~30 individuals, of which ~10 are males and ~20 are females (Chowfin and Leslie 2014, 2016). Nesting data at Corbett in recent years (2012-2017) are largely unavailable, but a 2013 report indicated &lt; 13 nests (Chowfin, 2013). Earlier reports in 2008 and 2011 indicated that few nests were observed (1-2 nests; Chowfin and Leslie 2013). Hatchling mortality to one year of age is high, ~99% (Chowfin and Leslie 2016). Available evidence indicates limited nesting habitat exists, and that the reproduction rate of approximately 38% of mature females nesting annually is low.<br/><br/><strong>Babai subpopulation </strong>(F on Table 1): The Babai River location, entirely protected within Bardia National Park, comprises 45 km of river, bounded downstream by a major barrage and upstream by unsuitable habitat containing shallow water and rapids, which restrict gharial movements. No nesting has been detected at this locality in recent years, and there have been no young gharial observed (Lang 2016b, 2017). Nesting near Kalinara on the Babai River was noted in the 1980s (pers. comm., K.M. Shrestha, p.16, cited in DNPWC 2018). A small group of mature adults (5-10 total, including males and females) may form the nucleus of a breeding group with the potential to recover the sub-population.&#160; Head-started juveniles were released in this location in 2014 and 2015, and it is considered an excellent candidate for future releases of captive-reared juveniles (Lang 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Minor locations </strong>(eight subpopulations; 1,200 km; ~50 mature adults in total): Four minor locations (I, L, M, N; Table 2) have very few confirmed resident adults (&lt;10 mature adults overall).&#160; A recent loss of large males and other adults, with habitat alteration, characterizes the Son River, Ken River, Mahanadi River, and Karnali River at Bardia NP locations.&#160; Of these, the Karnali River site (I) is possibly recoverable, if adequate protection was achieved through legislation and enforcement, and if a robust restocking program were initiated.&#160; The other locations (Son, Ken, and Mahanadi Rivers; L-N) lack adequate protection from water use, detrimental resource extraction and unregulated fishing, all of which are currently impeding recovery (Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2011; Nair and Katdare 2013, 2014b; Mohanty <em>et al</em>. 2010; Nair <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The other four minor locations are diverse and difficult to categorize (G, H, J, K; Table 2). Two sites (Hooghly and Jamuna; H, J) are long stretches of deltaic rivers in the Ganges-Brahmaputra drainages in which small numbers of gharial have been encountered and/or documented during intermittent surveys (Ghosh and Merrill 2010; Ghosh 2013; Rashid <em>et al</em>. 2014; IUCN Bangladesh 2016).&#160; In these areas, shoreline and potential nesting habitats are especially transient, and residency patterns and known nesting sites have not been documented.&#160; Protection in these areas will be particularly challenging. <br/>Upstream in the Gangetic tributaries, the Ghaghara River location (G; Table 2) may contain a small number of mature adults in the middle and lower stretches, but nesting/recruitment has not been documented.&#160; Downstream movements from the Katerniaghat location upstream, probably by juveniles crossing the barrage during high water episodes, may augment gharial numbers in the Ghaghara River location (G). In recent years (2013-2017), there have been multiple releases of captive-raised juveniles in the upstream Ghaghara, in the vicinity of resident gharial sighted during recent surveys (pers. comm., S. Singh 2017)<br/><br/>The remaining minor locations are in the Brahmaputra-Barack Rivers, grouped here as a single location (K; Table 2).&#160; Much less is known about gharial distribution and abundance in Northeast (NE) India, primarily in Assam and possibly Aranchal and Manipur (Das <em>et al</em>. 2013). Saikia <em>et al</em>. (2010) describes 11 sightings during 2004-2007, identifying four specific sites as “direct observations”, and others documented by the Assam Forest Department. One site is a natural lake, Uropod beel (=lake) where gharial have reputedly been captured and photographed (see Saikia <em>et al</em>. 2010). T. Ghosh (pers. comm. 2017) observed a gharial in Dibru Saikhowa National Park, and he reports local residents make additional sightings in this area. In contrast, a detailed assessment of potential gharial habitats in NE India, principally at Manas, Nameri, Orang, Kaziranga, Dibru National Parks, and&#160; D’ering Sanctuary in 2011, found no evidence of gharial in these protected areas (Das <em>et al</em>. 2011). Clearly, information about gharial persisting in NE India is lacking, and additional data are needed.<br/><br/><strong>Hastinapur subpopulation </strong>(O on Table 2): In addition to the 14 major and minor locations where gharial are extant, there is an additional location where head-started juveniles have been released from 2009 through 2017. This is a protected stretch of the upstream Ganges River mainstream, near Meerut in NW Uttar Pradesh, recently established as a wildlife sanctuary in the midst of an intensively agricultural, riverine landscape. Some juveniles released have evidently survived and become resident, mostly within the protected area. Now sub adults, they are expected to mature in the next 5-10 years.&#160; This section of the Ganges was formerly occupied by gharial, and the overall strategy for river conservation is to re-establish the resident fauna and flora, to the extent possible. This is an innovative project conducted by the WWF India Freshwater Program, in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department and Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, Government of India (Yadav and Khan 2016). However, since the generation time for gharial is estimated at 25 years, the lead time before intrinsic breeding is re-established at Hastinapur is likely to be at least 5 to 15 years into the future.",Increasing,"<p>Historically, prior to 1943, Gharial were common and abundant in the main rivers and tributaries of the Indus, Gangetic and Brahmaputra drainages, and also inhabited the Mahanadi-Brahmini system in north central India. The species may have occurred in other rivers in peninsular India, such as the Godavari-Indravati rivers, as well as in the rivers and tributaries of the Irrawaddy in Myanmar, but supporting data are scant, equivocal or lacking (Singh 1991, Ranjitsinh and Singh 2002, Thorbjarnarson <em>et al.</em> 2006, KoKo and Platt 2012).<br/><br/>The species is now limited to only 14 widely spaced, restricted localities in north India and lowland Nepal. Five subpopulations [Chambal River, Katerniaghat Reservoir (on Girwa River), Chitwan National Park (Nepal), Corbett National Park and Gandak River] exhibit recent reproduction/recruitment (Table 1 in the Supporting Information). Levels of nesting are commensurate with the estimated number of mature females occurring at Chambal River and at Katerniaghat Reservoir. Limited nesting, relative to the number of adult females, occurs at Chitwan, Corbett and on the Gandak River. Reproduction is not evident currently in the Babai subpopulation at Bardia NP, despite an apparently, a small number of mature females (~5-10+) inhabiting this protected stretch of river, where nesting may occur in future years. Taken together, these five locations (excluding Chambal) account for &lt;15% of the global population, and &lt; 14% of the known nesting abundance. Eight minor sites with no breeding evident account for less than 25 mature adults, or the remaining &lt;5% of the gharial metapopulation.<br/><br/>Only one locality—National Chambal Sanctuary—is an open, protected riverine habitat, with strong water flow, normal seasonal migration and natural unobstructed movements 625 km river km (A; Table 1 in the Supporting Information). The Katerniaghat locality (B; Table 1 in the Supporting Information) is very small in comparison (&lt;20 km) and is utilised by gharial living in a reservoir behind a barrage on the Girwa River. The other four potential breeding river locations are either limited in size, unprotected or subject to disturbances from variable water flow, fishing, sand mining, cultivation: they exhibit limited or no natural recruitment.&#160; Remnant subpopulations are known at eight minor localities (G-M; Table 2 in the Supporting Information), characterized by low numbers of adults, and unfavourable, mostly unprotected habitats. Currently, in 2018, gharial are extirpated in Pakistan, Bhutan, Myanmar, and possibly Bangladesh where only few, vagrant individuals may persist.</p>","<p>  </p><p>Eggs are known to be harvested as a food source and for medicinal purposes by river-dwelling local societies on the Girwa and the Rapti – Narayani Rivers (Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2007)<span class=""datalabel1"">. Hunting of the species is no longer considered a significant threat (Choudhury <em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1""> 2007). Gharial do not contribute to the local economies through consumptive uses but are featured in eco-tourism, which is primarily bird-based, at multiple localities in all three states along the National Chambal Sanctuary.&#160; </span></p>  <br/><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><p></p></span>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>For nearly half a century, serious concerns have been expressed about the status and continued survival of Gharial populations globally (Biswas 1970; Bustard 1975, 1999; Whitaker 1975, 1987; Maskey 1999, 2008; Sharma and Basu 2004; Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2007). In a recent commentary and review, Stevenson (2015) outlined a brief history of these conservation initiatives for gharial, and evaluates successes and failures. These efforts have included ex-situ activities focused on enhancing existing populations and re-establishing populations in places where the species has been extirpated. <em>Ex situ</em> activities include production of juveniles through conservation ranching and captive breeding, with releases and introductions into wild habitats. <em>In situ</em> activities, focused on enhancing and strengthening existing populations, include habitat protection, direct species protection measures, and local community programs aimed at species’ protection and continued survival.<br/><br/><strong> Head-starting</strong>: Conservation ranching of wild eggs, with rear and release programs, were at the centre of initial conservation actions in the 1970s and 1980s, in both India (Bustard 1999) and Nepal (Maskey 1999). To date, in excess of 6,000 Gharial have been reared and released in both countries (India: ~5,000; Stevenson 2015; Nepal: ~1,000; Khadka&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Lang 2016b; Acharya <em>et al</em>. 2017). However, the success of these programs is open to question, and remains largely untested. The initial restocking of suitable habitats such as the Chambal and Katerniaghat in India contributed to curbing the rapid rate of population decline prior to 1970s, helped stabilize existing numbers, and led to eventual population increases in selected localities. In fact many of breeding adults now living in the National Chambal Sanctuary may be animals released as juveniles 10 to 30 years ago. But a lack of any robust marking protocols or systematic follow-up on the fate of such releases, preclude objective evaluation of their effectiveness. Elsewhere, repeated releases of head-started juveniles have not resulted in appreciable population increases, and the fate of released individuals are either not known (Stevenson 2015) or known to have not succeeded in boosting the wild population (Shah and Paudel 2016, Acharya <em>et al</em>. 2017, Lang 2017). In general, relative to other species such as alligators, gharial eggs have proved difficult to transport and incubate successfully under artificial conditions. Likewise, developing suitable techniques for rearing gharial hatchlings (which prefer to feed on live fish) that thrive and grow in captivity has proved challenging. The head starting of gharials has proven to be more difficult than anticipated, expensive and has not become the panacea for gharial conservation anticipated, particularly when resources and manpower are in short supply.<br/><br/> <strong>Captive breeding</strong>: In India, successful captive breeding programs were established for gharial in the 1980s and 1990s, notably at Nandan Kanan in Odisha, at the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in Tamil Nadu and at the Kukrail Breeding Center in Uttar Pradesh (Bustard 1984, 1999; Whitaker 1987).&#160; These facilities, in turn, produced young Gharial for the various release programs, as well as for exchanges with Asian and international zoos worldwide.&#160; In Nepal, the major sources of gharial for the head-start programs have been <em>ex situ</em> incubation of eggs from wild nests, but this strategy has been augmented in recent years by captive breeding (Khadka <em>et al</em>. 2013). Outside of south Asia, success in the captive breeding of gharial in zoos has lagged behind successful programs for most other crocodilian species but recently there have been some notable successes in Europe and in the USA (e.g., Crocodile Zoo Protivin in Czech Republic; Saint Augustine Alligator Farm, Florida).<br/><br/><strong>Release strategies</strong>: Within a decade after the start of Project Crocodile in India, more than a thousand raised juvenile gharial, 2 to 5 years of age, were released back into protected habitats (Whitaker 1987). In addition to releases in the National Chambal Sanctuary, gharial were released in the Girwa, Sharda, Ramganga, main Ganges, Betwa, Ghaghara, and Suheli Rivers (Bustard 1999). In the intervening years, prior to the species’ listing to Critically Endangered in 2007, releases have continued apace, but as Bustard (1999) noted earlier, “no systematic monitoring is being carried out”. Since 2007, releases have continued, but are poorly documented by individual state Forest Departments within India. These have occurred at localities inhabited by Gharial at Chambal, Girwa (=Katerniaghat), Ghaghara, Gandak, and Ken Rivers. In addition, head-started Gharial have been released in previously occupied habitats, including the Upper Ganges in protected sanctuaries, at Hastinapur in Uttar Pradesh, and at Haricke, in a reservoir on the Beas River, a tributary of the Indus in the Punjab, India. These latter two releases are re-introductions of juvenile Gharial back into riverine habitats from which gharial had been extirpated previously. Here the objective is to re-establish Gharial where they used to occur historically, but were eliminated in recent times.&#160; Similar efforts were made in the Koshi River, Nepal on repeated occasions in the 1980s and 1990s, but these earlier attempts to re-establish gharial failed (Shah and Paudel 2016). Recent releases in Nepal (2007 to 2016) at Bardia and at Chitwan have not resulted in appreciable population increases (Acharya <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Extensive conservation work has likely driven the slowing rate of decline, but much more work is required to prevent the extinction of this species.<p></p>  <p></p>","The species has a very specialised breeding habitat, using only lagoon spits with crowberry-lichen vegetation or dwarf birch and willow sedges near lakes and marshes, together with adjacent estuary and mudflat habitats that are used as feeding sites by adults during nesting. It may also use stream-deposited gravel pits (Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species has never been recorded breeding further than 5 km (and exceptionally once 7 km) from the sea shore. Breeding birds are very site-faithful. It breeds either in single pairs or loose aggregations (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. It nests in June-July (Tomkovich 1992, 1995,&#160;Van Gils <em>et al</em>. 2020), with failed breeders potentially leaving on migration before others (Zhang Lin 2016). During winter, it prefers mixed sandy tidal mudflats with an uneven surface and very shallow water, mainly in the outermost parts of river deltas and outer islands, often with a higher sand content and thin mud layer on top. In the areas with total coastal conversion, it favours certain stages in the management of saltpans (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The species uses a&#160;variety of feeding techniques that includes a larger variety of food items across the range, including terrestrial insects, small seeds, larvae of beetles and small aquatic amphipods (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2018, Van Gils&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Evidence to support suspicions that immature birds spend their first summer on the wintering grounds until their second year come from ringing recoveries (Tomkovich 1995, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2010a), photographs of a  second calendar-year bird in Thailand in July 2010 (G. Chutima<em> in litt</em>. 2010) and another individual in Bangladesh in June 2015 (S. U. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016),&#160;as well as oversummering and passage birds in the Rudong mudflats (Clark&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Zhang&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;<p></p><p></p>","Throughout its migratory and wintering ranges, tidal flats are being reclaimed for coastal development (industry, leisure, infrastructure, aquaculture and agriculture) and are becoming increasingly polluted. The important staging area at Saemangeum and Geum estuary, South Korea, including the Mangyeung and Tongjin estuaries, has already been reclaimed, and remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2008). Since the reclamation at Saemangeum in 2007, only an average of a single individual has been recorded, in contrast to 'hundreds' prior to the development (Lee <em>et al. </em>2018). Plans for a large-scale reclamation project on the Tiaozini Sandbanks, (part of the Rudong mudflats) were feared to threatened over 60,000 ha of mudflats used by the species by 2020 (Moores 2015,&#160;J. Li and M. Tong to C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017), and elsewhere at Rudong new seawalls were being built in 2015 (Zöckler 2015, Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). However, the national announcement of an end to the reclamation of intertidal land in January 2018 (Anon. 2018, Lei 2018) appears to be a dramatic shift towards alleviating new impacts from this threat and these sites are included in the World Heritage Site nomination.<br/><br/>Smooth Cord-grass&#160;<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>&#160;is an invasive plant used to stabilise mudflats to assist in reclamation along the Chinese coast and rapidly leaves intertidal areas unsuitable for Spoon-billed Sandpipers, dramatically reducing habitat availability (Menxiu <em>et al. </em>2012, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017). At both Rudong and Dongling, <em>Spartina </em><em>alterniflora</em> has formed dense stands with considerable spread noted between spring 2014 and autumn 2015 (Peng <em>et al. </em>2017), and it has also been found on Leizhou mudflat (V. Fu&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2017). The Rudong mudflats are also&#160;the site for development of the largest wind farm in Asia, which could prove to be another threat to this species (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007, 2009, 2010, Li <em>et al. </em>undated)<strong></strong>.&#160;Plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia and cross-dams along the coast of Bangladesh continue to pose threats (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010a, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2011, Zöckler 2015); however, this plan is currently on hold and plans to protect the area have been developed (Zöckler&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009,&#160;<strong></strong>Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009,&#160;Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010b, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler<em> in litt. </em>2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b, Martinez &amp; Lewthaithe 2013)<strong></strong>, and this may be a particularly serious threat to birds wintering on Nan Thar Island and in the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b). A survey of hunting activities in five villages around Sonadia Island, Bangladesh, in September 2010 found that of the 53 hunters interviewed, eight of them claimed to have caught a total of 22 Spoon-billed Sandpipers between October 2009 and April 2010 (Chowdhury 2010). Hunting in the species's non-breeding range could be a crucial factor in the poor rate of recruitment into the breeding population, as immature birds do not return to the breeding areas until they are two years old and thus are more exposed to capture (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b)<strong></strong>. However, recent conservation action aimed at reducing trapping on the wintering grounds appears to have been successful (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014) and may have reduced this significant source of mortality (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016, Aung <em>et al</em>. 2016/2017).&#160;Large-scale wader trapping was observed at Fucheng, south-west Guangdong province, China, where four Spoon-billed Sandpiper were observed in December 2012 (BirdLife Asia 2013), but surveys for the species in south China in January 2017 did not find any illegal mist nets (V. Fu <em>in litt. </em>2017). Monofilament fishing nets set over high tides were found to be a serious problem on the central Chinese coast, with multiple parallel lines of nets set at Tiaozini&#160;in autumn 2015 were found to have captured scores of birds after just one nocturnal high tide, including one juvenile Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Peng <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;Hunting with nets has also been reported from Viet Nam (Long 2015). Recently the scale of hunting in the Russian far northeast has been found to be much greater than previously assumed, and may impact the species during the immediate post-breeding period particularly.<br/><br/>Between August and October 2014, more than a thousand dead wading birds, including two Spoon-billed Sandpipers, were found on the Tiaozini Sandbanks (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Peng <em>et al. </em>2017). Tests are ongoing to understand the cause of mortality; however, poisoned bait was discovered in the area.<br/><br/>There are no immediate threats to the breeding grounds, but nests in the vicinity of villages are sometimes destroyed by dogs (<strong></strong>E. Syroechkovskiy <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Poor breeding productivity in recent years has been attributed to heavy nest predation and bad weather (Syroechkovskiy<em> et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>. Significant habitat degradation has been observed in 5 of 30 visited breeding locations (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010)<strong></strong>. Human disturbance, both by residents and researchers, may cause increased levels of nest desertion and predation by foxes and skuas (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Shorebirds, including this species, are also occasionally killed by children with slingshots (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>; one male was also shot by a Russian hunter near the Chinese border in 2008 (Zöckler &amp; Syroechkovskiy 2008)<strong></strong>. Small but significant numbers of birds and their eggs have been collected for scientific purposes in the last 20 years, with one small colony completely wiped out due to this activity (Syroechkovsky 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and other species dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 57% of the breeding habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler &amp; Lysenko 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;Recent observation on the breeding grounds unfortunately confirm a worrying trend of increasing bushes intruding on the coastal tundra habitats in the southern range, as well as drying of the tundra in the northern range with significant&#160;consequences on food access for breeding waders (C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020)<p></p><p></p>","A total of ten repeats of a Lincoln-Peterson method to estimate the global population have resulted in a weighted mean single global estimate of 490 mature individuals (95% confidence limits 360-620) for the six-year period between 2014-2019 (Green <em>et al. </em>2021). However, the most recent winter counts suggest a total number of birds in the order of 330-340 individuals (Zöckler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021), indicating that the total of mature individuals may actually already have fallen below 250 if we assume fewer than three-quarters of these are mature individuals. As such the population is placed within a custom band of 240-620 mature individuals, with a best single value of 490 (Green <em>et al. </em>2021) but noting that this figure may already be outdated.<br/><br/>The trend of these estimates, albeit over a short-time frame, was a mean rate of reduction of 8% (Green <em>et al. </em>2021), similar to the 9% estimated from surveys of the most important wintering population in Myanmar (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010a). However, the confidence interval of the more recent trend estimates overlapped zero, such that there is low confidence in the accuracy of the trend magnitude. In the absence of better information, and noting the congruence with the rate of reduction estimated from wintering surveys, this rate of decline is taken to be the best estimate for the population as a whole for the current timeframe. This rate of reduction is equivalent (using an exponential model of decline) to a three-generation reduction of 68% (over 13.4 years), estimated as a rate of continuing decline of 31.5% in one generation (4.5 years) and 52.7% in two generations (9 years). However, prior to 2009 the rate of population reduction, based on counts of breeding pairs at surveyed locations, was reported to be extremely rapid at an annual rate of 26% between 2002-2008 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010a). As such, the past rate of reduction for the most recent three-generation period (2007-2021) is suspected to have been at a higher rate, and, given the uncertainty, is placed in a band of 70-80%.",Decreasing,"This species has a naturally limited breeding range on the Chukotsk peninsula and southwards to the isthmus of the Kamchatka peninsula, in north-eastern <strong>Russia </strong>(BirdLife International 2001,&#160;Zoeckler &amp; Lappo 2008). It migrates down the western Pacific coast through Russia, <strong>Japan</strong>, <strong>North Korea</strong>, <strong>South Korea</strong>, mainland <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Hong Kong</strong> (China), <strong>Taiwan</strong> (China) and <strong>Viet Nam,</strong> to its main wintering grounds in southern China, Viet Nam, <strong>Thailand</strong>,&#160;<strong>Bangladesh </strong>and <strong>Myanmar </strong>(Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is a vagrant visitor in <strong>Cambodia </strong>and <strong>Indonesia </strong>(during non-breeding seasons here particularly; C.&#160;Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Wintering birds have also been recorded from <strong>India </strong>(with a recent sighting in 2018 possibly the first for 14 years [Roy 2018]), <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, the Fujian province in China (the Min Jiang estuary in Fujian has recently been identified as an important wintering site for the species [F. Cheung <em>in litt. </em>2010, Bai <em>et al</em>. 2015,&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016]), Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China&#160;((Martinez &amp; Lewthwaite 2013,&#160;Fu 2015), and peninsular&#160;<strong>Malaysia</strong>. It occurs regularly at only a few sites within this wintering range, with important sites in Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and China. Sonadia Island and Meghna Estuary (Bangladesh), the Gulf of Martaban and Nan Thar (Myanmar) were believed to support over half of the wintering population (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2018); over 80% of the entire population were considered to winter in Myanmar and Bangladesh (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). However, recent surveys show that the Southern China coast in Guandong and Guanxi Provinces also host significant numbers (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016) and that the numbers in Bangladesh and Myanmar are falling more rapidly than at sites further north along the migratory route (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). It seems likely that the bulk of the population now winters along the Chinese coast.<br/><br/>Records of wintering birds in&#160;Myanmar are of 84 individuals in 2008, 73 in January 2009, and 89 in 2010 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>; 150-220 in the Bay of Martaban in 2010-2012&#160;<strong style=""FONT-WEIGHT: normal"">(</strong>Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2014) and approximately 155 in the upper bay of Martaban in January 2015 (Clark 2015). In 2016, an estimated 100-112 individuals were present in the upper Gulf of Mottama, Myanmar (Aung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, 2020), a reduction from 244 individuals observed in 2009 (Aung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Recent counts reinforce this rapid reduction, with only 47 individuals counted in January 2021 despite high coverage (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>In March-April 2010, a minimum total of 49 individuals were recorded during targeted surveys along the coast of Bangladesh (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2011)<strong></strong>. A new site along the Meghna Estuary was discovered in 2015, which supported a minimum of 48 individuals in February 2016 (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Surveys along the Bangladesh coast from December 2015 to February 2016 found a record number of a minimum of 76 individuals from different sites along the coast, the highest numbers recorded since 1989 in Bangladesh (Chowdhury 2016). However since 2016 numbers located in Bangladesh in winter have fallen rapidly, with fewer than ten counted in January 2021 (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>During the winter of 2015-2016, it was estimated that 10 adults used the Gulf of Thailand (K. Sutasha <em>in litt</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>China Coastal Waterbird Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2013 (Bai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) identified the following sites as of international importance for the species: Yalu Jliang estuarine wetland (Liaoning), Rudong coast (Jiangsu), Dongtai coast (Jiangsu), Dongling coast (Jiangsu), Minjiang Estuary National Nature Reserve (Fujian), Dadeng Island and Weitou Bay (Fujian) and Xitou coast (Guangdong).&#160;<br/><br/>A total of 61 individuals was recorded wintering in southern China (present at ten of 36 surveyed sites) in the January 2021 coordinated surveys (Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance&#160;2021). The Leizhou Peninsula has been identified as an important area, holding about 50 birds (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016, C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2016): 33 were counted in January 2021&#160;(Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance&#160;2021).<br/>&#160;<br/>China is of primary importance during post-breeding and migration periods. It is likely that a large proportion of the adult population of the species spends time at Rudong, China, in both autumn and spring (Menxiu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is currently the only known moulting site for the species (Bai <em>et al</em>. 2015, Peng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Counts of up to 103 individuals at Rudong in October 2011, 106 in October 2012, 140 in October 2013 (Zöckler and Li 2013), a minimum of 226 in September 2014 and 177-190 in October 2014 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2015) are likely to have accounted for a substantial proportion of the global population (M. Tong <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). A maximum of 100 birds were recorded on the Tiaozini mudflats (part of the Rudong mudflats), Dongtai County, in October 2014 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2015), with more than 100 birds recorded at Tiaozini in October 2015 (Li and Chowdhury 2016). A survey in May 2015 on the Rudong mudflats recorded at least 62 individuals, including a number of head-started birds (Phillips 2015). Modelling work has shown Rudong to be too far for the species to reach in a single flight from its breeding grounds and work is underway to identify another stopover site in the Russian Far East (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Due to its specialised breeding habitat requirements, it was probably always a scarce species, but numbers dropped rapidly, at least between 2000 and 2010 (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Surveys on the breeding grounds revealed a dramatic decline from 2,000-2,800 pairs in the 1970s (which assumes equal distribution of the species and may have potentially excluded unknown sites; C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2019) to fewer than 1,000 pairs in 2000, 402-572 pairs in 2003, 350-380 pairs in 2005 (Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong> and not more than 150-320 pairs in 2008. The breeding population in 2009-2010 was optimistically estimated at 120-200 pairs (<strong></strong>Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a<strong></strong>)<strong></strong> in an estimated total population of 500-800 individuals, perhaps indicating an 88% decline since 2002, equating to an annual rate of decline of 26%<strong></strong><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""> </span>(Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a)<strong></strong>. These declines have taken place across all known breeding sites, and it is unlikely that significant colonies remain undiscovered (<strong></strong>Zöckler 2005, <strong></strong>Zöckler &amp; Bunting<em> </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Declines were also observed at wintering grounds. For example, no birds were sighted wintering in Viet Nam in 2009 at a site that supported at least 27 birds in the mid 1990s (E. Syroechkovskiy <em>et al. in litt.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. However, over the last few years (2013-2015), there are signs that active conservation interventions may have stemmed this rapid population decline and the small remaining population appears decline at a slower pace of still 8-10% (Aung <em>et al</em>. 2018,&#160;Aung <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Breeding success is quite low: average productivity was 0.66 young fledged per nest in 2005, and much lower in 2007, and this is compounded by a very low rate of juveniles and adults returning to the breeding grounds. Until recently, the species has had an ageing and rapidly declining population with little recruitment (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2010). For example, data collected on birds at one breeding area from 2003 to 2009 suggest that recruitment into the adult breeding population was effectively zero in all years apart from 2005 and 2007 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010a)<strong></strong>. In 2013, for the first time there was no decline detected at the core breeding area of Meinypylgino, where the population was stable at c.10 pairs (Zöckler 2013). In June 2014, an expedition to Russkaya Koshka recorded an increase in the number of breeding territories recovering from a low of 1-2 pairs in previous years (Nitschke <em>et al</em>. 2015), but numbers are still not near levels known from the early 2000s (Tomkovich <em>et al.</em> 2002, C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In July 2011 and 2016, an expedition in Kamchatka located each a previously unknown breeding area for the species (Heritage Expeditions 2016), with around 3 pairs each.&#160;<em></em><p></p>","Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007, 2009,&#160;<strong></strong>Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009,&#160;Bird<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2010, Zöckler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010b, Martinez and Lewthaithe 2013). Trapping using monofilament nets is also frequent on the Chinese coast during migration periods and Spoon-billed Sandpipers have been observed being caught (Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I and II. The species has been added to the list as a Class 1 protected species on the National Key Protected Wild Animal List of China: it is forbidden to hunt, capture, kill, sell, acquire and use the species (Choi 2021).  Fourteen sites along the coast of Bohai Gulf and the Yellow Sea in China have been nominated for World Heritage Site status. Protected areas in its breeding, staging and wintering areas include Moroshechnaya and several local wildlife refuges on the Chukotsk peninsula (Russia), Yancheng and Chongming Dongtan (China), Mai Po (Hong Kong), Lanyang estuary (Taiwan, China), Point Calimere and Chilka lake (India), and Xuan Thuy Nature Reserve (Vietnam). In September 2019 the Bird Conservation Society of Thailand completed the purchase of 8 hectares to conserve habitat at Pak Thale, within the Pak Thale-Laem Phak Bia Flyway Network site recognised by the Government of Thailand (Jearwattanakanok &amp; Yong 2019). The Gulf of Mottama (160,000 ha), Myanmar has also been proposed as a Ramsar site and the area belonging to Mon State is soon to be designated (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zöckler 2015). This work across the Gulf of Mottama headed by the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Task Force, with support from the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Rainforest Trust, also ensure sustainable development in line with conservation goals (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is also legally protected under the Wildlife Act of Myanmar, however the law lacks full implementation (Aung <em>et al</em>. 2020). In 2019, the main stop over sites in Tiaozini (Rudong) were also included into the World Heritage Site nomination (C. Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Hunters within the area have also signed agreements to surrender trapping equipment and engage in alternate livelihoods (Ceci 2017). Work by the group 'SBS in China' recently lead to the local government designating a 10,000 ha area for Spoon-billed Sandpipers in Rudong (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Chinese government have additionally declared a moratorium for future coastal development (P. Insua-Cao <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Shellfish protected areas have also been designated, which will provide suitable feeding habitat for birds and protect local livelihoods. <br/><br/>Annual surveys of breeding sites on Chukotka are undertaken and over 450 adults and young have been ringed on the breeding grounds since 2000 (Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Annual searches of potential new breeding sites have taken place from 2011 to at least 2013 (Zöckler 2013).&#160;Recent advances on the protection of important site for the species have additionally accelerated. In Myanmar, 2 further Ramsar sites protects the species in&#160;the the Ayeyarwady Delta (50,000 ha) and Nan Thar Island (40,000), with a vast increase in the official protection level, including preparations for the last remaining site in the south of the country to be protected (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). &#160;Since 2018, the government of Chukotka is also supporting the development of a 300,000 ha large protected area that is adequately named the Land of the Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Syroechkovsky 2019).<br/> <br/>A range of awareness and outreach programmes have taken place. Local support groups have been established in some breeding areas and negotiations have taken place to reduce short-term hunting pressure at one of the key wintering sites in Myanmar (Zöckler &amp; Htin Hla 2009, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>. Researchers and a local environmentalist group convinced two villages on Nan Thar Island, Myanmar, to agree to a hunting ban of the species, with a view to develop an ecologically and economically sound alternative in the future (C. Zöckler <em>in litt. </em>2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler <em>et al. </em>2010b)<strong></strong>. The development of ecotourism at Nan Thar generated extra income for local people and encouraged them to protect the birds (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Bay of Martaban, socio-economic surveys carried out in early 2010 indicated that bird-hunting is undesirable and that most hunters would readily switch to alternative livelihoods if assisted<strong></strong> (BANCA 2010)<strong></strong>. These surveys were swiftly followed by mitigation activities in the same year, in which hunters agreed to stop their activities in exchange for equipment to provide them with an alternative income source, and awareness-raising events and materials were provided for whole communities (BANCA<em> in litt</em>. 2010)<strong></strong>. On the eastern shore of the Gulf of Martaban, 9 out of 15 hunters targeted by the mitigation activities had increased their livelihood status, the remaining six had neither increased nor decreased their livelihood status (BANCA 2012). Conservationists in Bangladesh successfully raised funds to provide hunters with loans so that they could establish new livelihoods, such as farming (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The Bangladesh Spoon-billed Sandpiper Conservation Project conducted a one year awareness-raising project on Sonadia Island, an important wintering site for the species (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). Activities involved former hunters visiting schools to talk about conservation work, film showings, boat races, mural painting and photography exhibitions (S. U. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;In 2011, awareness-raising and advocacy activities including two training workshops took place in schools in China. Schoolchildren living close to the species's breeding grounds in Russia have also been taught about the species and sent letters to other schoolchildren living along the flyway asking them to protect the species (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>A Species Action Plan was produced in 2006 (Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2008), and updated in 2008 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong> and 2010 (Zöckler <em>et al.</em> 2010b)<strong></strong>. At the fifth meeting of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership in Cambodia in December 2010, the partners agreed to establish a Task Force for this species, charged with implementing the action plan (Fowlie 2011).&#160;In 2012, the 'Saving Spoony's Chinese Wetlands' project came top in a vote organised by the Disney Foundation, winning $100,000 to support conservation efforts for the species (Clark&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Headstarting, or artificial incubation and captive rearing on the breeding grounds, avoids the high levels of natural predation that occur at egg and chick stage. This significantly increased breeding success, with the number of wild birds fledged increasing by approximately five times per pair (D. Pain&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). In addition, by taking eggs within days of them being laid early in the season, some birds lay a second clutch that they incubate and raise themselves. Headstarting expeditions in 2012 and 2013 have resulted in the release of a total of 25 juveniles from 35 eggs collected (Zöckler 2013). In 2015, 37 eggs were collected for headstarting in Chukotka, of which 35 were fertile (B. Hughes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015). In July 2016, the headstarting programme successfully released 30 fledglings, the most birds released in a single year. 22 chicks from 30 eggs survived to fledging in 2020, but despite continued releases the number of headstarted birds appears to have ceased offsetting the decline at the release site in 2019 (Syroechkovskiy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).<br/><br/>A&#160;captive-rearing and breeding programme started in 2011, when eggs were collected in Chukotka, and the young birds reared in captivity in Russia were subsequently transported to purpose-built conservation breeding facilities at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust headquarters at Slimbridge,<strong> </strong>UK (Pain 2010)<strong></strong>. In 2012, eggs were transported from Chukotka direct to Slimbridge (Pain <em>et al</em>. 2011, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2013). In May 2014 the captive population numbered 25 birds (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2014). Two pairs of captive birds at Slimbridge started to breed in 2016 (D. Pain <em>in litt</em>. 2016). One chick fledged in 2018 but unfortunately died shortly after, but two chicks were successfully reared fledging in 2019 and remain alive in 2021. No further successful breeding has occurred, and in 2020 several of the eight and nine year-old founders of the captive population died, possibly due at least in part to age (Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust 2021).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to develop captive breeding programmes and continue to monitor numbers at known breeding sites and carry out searches of suitable habitat in north Kamchatka. Continue to survey wintering sites to monitor the population and identify key sites in the East Asian Flyway to help ensure their protection. Campaign against the continued reclamation of intertidal mudflats along the entire migration route. Restore reclaimed wetland sites.&#160;Continue to search for stopover sites in the Russian Far East (Clark&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Actively prevent collection of eggs and birds for scientific purposes, museums and private collections. Take measures to ensure that researcher activity does not increase mortality. Ensure effective legal protection of all known breeding sites. Survey existing and potential wintering sites in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Stop hunting and trapping at key sites in Myanmar, Bangladesh and Russia. Ensure awareness-raising activities are maintained in the long-term. Ensure protection of newly discovered sites and existing sites, especially in South Korea. Legally protect it in all range states. Identify and mitigate pressures at breeding grounds. Lobby against plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia, Bangladesh (Bird<em> et al</em>. 2010, Chowdhury 2012) and protect important sites along the Meghna Estuary, Bangladesh (Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Pursue protected area status for the Bay of Martaban and other coastal sites in Myanmar (BANCA<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Zöckler <em>et al</em>. 2014). Encourage initiatives that promote opportunities for ex-hunters to become bird guides (P. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<p></p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
154915043,22695231,Aegypius monachus,Near Threatened,C1,2021,2020-06-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has a moderately small population which appears to be suffering an ongoing decline in its Asiatic strongholds, despite the fact that in parts of Europe numbers are now increasing. Consequently it qualifies as Near Threatened. <p></p>","The species inhabits forested areas in hills and mountains at 300-1,400 m in Spain, but higher in Asia, where it also occupies scrub and arid and semi-arid alpine steppe and grasslands up to 4,500 m<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Thiollay 1994). It forages over many kinds of open terrain, including forest, bare mountains, steppe and open grasslands.  Nests are built in trees or on rocks (the latter extremely rarely in Europe but more frequently in parts of Asia), often aggregated in very loose colonies or nuclei.  Its diet consists mainly of carrion from medium-sized or large mammal carcasses, although snakes and insects have been recorded as food items. Live prey is rarely taken. In Mongolia, at least, the species is reliant on livestock numbers for successful nesting (Batbayar <em>et al</em>. 2006).  <p></p>","The two main threats to the species are direct mortality caused by humans (either accidentally or deliberately) and decreasing availability of food. The main cause of unnatural death is the use of poisoned baits for predator extermination<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b), although shooting and destruction of nests also occurs<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b; N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005), and they may accidentally get caught in traps set for other predators (Zhatkanbaev 2011)<strong></strong>. Shooting and poisoning are increasing in Mongolia<em></em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, and many birds are trapped or shot in China for their feathers. There are fears that veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several <em>Gyps</em> vultures in India, may have a negative impact on <em>A. monachus</em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005; Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016)<strong></strong>, particularly as increasing numbers of the species are wintering in northern India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(T. Katzner <em>in litt. </em>2005). The recent approval for commercialisation of veterinary diclofenac in Spain may have devastating effects on European vultures - in 2020 a Cinereous Vulture was confirmed as the first individual to die from veterinary diclofenac in Europe (BirdLife 2021). A study in central Spain during 2003-2005 found high concentrations of antibiotics in blood samples from 57% of nestlings tested<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Lemus <em>et al</em>. 2008). The same study found two antibiotics in the liver samples of all dead nestlings that were tested. It is hypothesised that antibiotic residues, particularly quinolones, cause liver and kidney damage, deplete lymphoid organs and alter bacteria flora, facilitating pathogenic bacterial and fungal infections<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Lemus <em>et al</em>. 2008). The anti-inflammatory drug nimesulide, suspected to be highly toxic is also considered to be present widely across Nepal (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2018). In Europe, decreased food availability was formerly caused by European Union legislation on carcass disposal<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b), however, recently passed regulations will allow the operation of feeding stations for scavengers<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(A. Brunner <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In eastern Europe and central Asia, particularly in the former Soviet Union, changes in agricultural practices and human migration from the countryside to the cities have greatly reduced numbers of domestic livestock. In Georgia and Armenia, declines may be linked to the loss of subsidies for sheep-herding in the post-Soviet era (M. McGrady <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Additionally, there have been steep declines in many populations of wild ungulates which provide a major food source for the species. The Saiga antelope (<em>Saiga tartarica</em>), for example, numbered over one million individuals ten years ago, and has now been reduced to a population of 30,000-40,000 owing to uncontrolled hunting and severe winters (W. Fremuth <em>in litt.</em> 2005). In South Korea, food limitation is a serious problem such that the species relies on supplementary food (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong style=""""></strong>. Habitat loss is also thought to be important<strong style=""""><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004). For instance, in Portugal, there may be suitable foraging areas, but nesting sites are limited (Lourenço <em>et al. </em>2013). The majority of brood losses occur during the incubation period and it is suspected this may be partially due to low and fluctuating temperatures (Batbayar <em style="""">et al</em>. 2006) and so changes in air temperatures resulting from climate change may be a potential future threat to the species. Nest abandonment can also occur as a result of disturbance, for instance cork exploitation (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2011). Recent studies surrounding the core population of Cinereous Vultures in the Balkans (thought to be genetically distinctive and geographically isolated) also found wind farms to be a potential threat towards the species (Vasilakis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Where operational wind farms existed, collision mortality was thought to affect c. 5-11% of the core population (Vasilakis&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Low mitochondrial diversity and demographic bottlenecks were also found in Turkish populations, likely preventing population expansion (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a, b). The exact effect genetic vulnerability however requires further investigation. Due to proximity to urban areas, electric shocks and collision can further impact migratory birds, especially across the species's migration route to China (Ming 2019).<br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated to number 8,400-11,400 pairs, equating to 16,800-22,800 mature individuals, or c.&#160;25,200-34,200 individuals. This consists of 2,900-3,400 pairs in Europe (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>) and 5,500-8,000 pairs in Asia (Anon. 2004). The population in Korea has been estimated at c.50-10,000 wintering individuals (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"This species breeds in <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, <strong>Greece</strong>, <strong>Turkey</strong>, <strong>Armenia</strong>, <strong>Azerbaijan</strong>, <strong>Georgia</strong>, <strong>Ukraine</strong>, <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, north <strong>India</strong>, northern <strong>Pakistan</strong> (A.

It was considered to occasionally breed in Portugal, North Macedonia and Albania, but no longer breed in Slovenia, Italy, Cyprus, Moldova and Romania. However, the species was seen in Romania, Italian eastern Alps, and in northern France recently, as well as being recorded in a rehabilitation center in Jordan (Bowden and Botha 2017).&#160;Recolonisation was also confirmed in Portugal following reintroduction programmes (Bowden and Botha 2017). Further monitoring is thus required to confirm its presence across south-western Europe. There are wintering areas in <strong>Sudan</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, Pakistan, north-west India, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan, Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Lao People's Democratic Republic, North Korea</strong> and <strong>South Korea</strong>. Its global population is estimated to number 8,400-11,400 pairs, with 2,900-3,400&#160;pairs in Europe<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>)<strong></strong> and 5,500-8,000<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004)<strong></strong> pairs in Asia. In Europe, populations are increasing in Spain (minimum 1,500 pairs [Barov and Derhé 2011]), Portugal and France&#160;(Barov and Derhé 2011) as well as Greece (BirdLife International 2015). Populations are&#160;stable in Macedonia<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Barov and Derhé 2011). Numbers are decreasing or fluctuating in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey and the Ukraine<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2004; Barov and Derhé 2011; BirdLife International 2015), though new nesting areas have been recently found in Turkey (Kirazli and&#160;Yamaç 2013)<strong></strong>. A recent study moreover suggests that the Turkish population (the largest in the Western Palearctic) is likely to number c. 112 individuals, existing as a single subpopulation (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a). Overall, the European population underwent a large increase between 1990 and 2000, possibly &gt;30% overall<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2004;  I. Burfield <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong> and increased from 1,330-1,874 in 1993-1996 to 1,995-2,852 in 2000-2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). The current European population trend is increasing (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).<br/><br/>Much less information is available regarding the status and population trends of the species in Asia, where the bulk of the global population resides.  There are probably over 1,000 pairs in the Asian part of Russia and a further 1,760 pairs in China<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Ye Xiao-Ti 1991). It appears that breeding populations are more or less stable in Mongolia<strong></strong> (where the species is described as common [<em></em>N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005]) and Pakistan (A. Khan, A. Parveen and R. Yasmeen <em>in litt.</em> 2005) (where it is described as scarce), although fluctuations in distribution and breeding success occur, and populations within some nature reserves in Mongolia (where there are few domestic livestock) are declining<em></em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005).  In Kazakhstan, however, populations of all vulture species are in severe decline, owing to a precipitous decline in their main food resource, the Saiga antelope (<em>Saiga tartarica</em>) (W. Fremuth <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. This trend may be mirrored in a number of other central Asian countries where populations of both domesticated livestock and wild ungulates have declined greatly in recent years<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(T. Katzner <em>in litt. </em>2005). Very little is known about population trends on its wintering grounds, although, in Nepal, wintering populations are declining in the east and possibly increasing in the west (but this may be due to better coverage) (Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016).<strong></strong>&#160;It may be increasing in India (T. Katzner <em>in litt.</em> 2005) and South Korea (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. CMS Appendix II. Raptors MOU Category 1. A Multi-species Action Plan for African-Eurasian Vultures has been produced (Botha <em>et al</em>. 2017). The Flyway Action Plan for the Conservation of the Cinereous Vulture (CVFAP) was additionally finalised in 2017 (Andevski <em>et al</em>. 2017). The EU Birds Directive has contributed to the recovery and conservation of the species in Europe, particularly Spain (see Moreno-Opo and Margalida 2014), where the population has increased from an estimated 290 pairs in 1984 to 2,068 pairs in 2011<strong style=""""></strong><span style=""font-weight: bold; ""> </span>(BirdLife International 2015). Co-operation between Spanish government agencies and conservationists under the 'Antidote Programme' also appears to have been effective in mitigating the effects of poisoned baits. Both the Spanish and the Andalusian Governments have produced anti-poisoning strategies, but the former still remain to be financially supported while the latter need more decisive official endorsement. A reintroduction project in Grands Causses, southern France has resulted in the establishment of a small breeding population (16 pairs were breeding in 2006 [Eliotout <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2007]) with good prospects. Following further transfer of eight Cinereous Vultures from Spain to France, in 2017, 35 breeding pairs were subsequently observed, with confirmed recolonisation in the Alentejo Region of Portugal (Bowden and Botha 2017). The species has also been seen in Romania, Italian eastern Alps, and in northern France, as well as a recent record in a rehabilitation center in Jordan (Bowden and Botha 2017). Supplementary feeding programmes have been initiated in Spain and France to provide a safe, poison-free food source, although there are concerns that the species may be not very prone to feed at conventional feeding stations. Captive breeding populations have also been established (Tewes <em>et al.&#160;</em>1998). In the Balkans, the species has only one stable colony in the Dadia forest reserve in northern Greece, where WWF has long been involved. Supplementary food is also provided in Bulgaria for breeding birds<strong style=""""></strong> (Anon. 2007)<strong style=""""></strong> and South Korea during the winter, which may be the factor attracting birds from Mongolia (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong style=""""></strong>. In eastern Europe and central Asia, fewer conservation actions are known, although the species occurs within a number of protected areas in the region. The Balkan Vulture Action Plan aims to transfer expertise and technology relating to the conservation of the species from western to eastern parts of Europe<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b)<strong style=""""></strong>. In Nepal&#160;in 2006, a ban was introduced on the production and importation of diclofenac for veterinary use and pharmaceutical firms were encouraged to promote a safe alternative called meloxicam (Swan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The use of diclofenac has since declined by 90% across parts of Nepal; however its complete elimination from the scavenger food chain has yet to be achieved (Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).&#160;The Government of Nepal endorsed the first Vulture Conservation Action Plan (VCAP) for Nepal (2009-13), and a second was launched in 2015.&#160;Approaches&#160;include: advocating additional bans on NSAIDs; continual education programmes; continual monitoring of NSAID use; swapping diclofenac with meloxicam; collection of veterinarian pledges to stop using diclofenac; operation, maintenance and expansion of vulture-safe feeding sites. Diclofenac-free Zones have been created in 46 Districts covering a total area of 101,160 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(68.73% ) of Nepal (DNPWC 2015). Further bans are progressing on aceclofenac in Haryana, India, and ketoprofen and aceclofenac in Bangladesh and Pakistan (C.

Research threats, particularly the decline in abundance of prey species. Carry out reintroductions to link up the western and the eastern sub-areas of the present range, following the recommendations of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Black Vulture Conservation Foundation; possibly focusing on releasing immature individuals rather than juveniles because they can breed earlier and so lead to faster settlement and breeding in the wild (Mihoub <em>et al. </em>2014). Develop the captive breeding programme to support both this and future reintroduction and supplementation efforts. Restore wild rabbit <em style="""">Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> populations in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands (Spain) as this may help to increase food availability, particularly during the breeding period. Promote cooperation and information exchange among people working on the species, both at a national and international level. Remove drugs like diclofenac and other harmful NSAIDs from the environment and control the illicit use of human diclofenac for veterinary purpose (H. S. Baral and C. Inskipp&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Strengthen and enforce legislation regulating trade in pesticides that are used to poison meat baits. Increase the rate of prosecution and the severity of judicial sentences for illegal poisoning. Protect appropriate breeding habitat (e.g. Moreno-Opo <em>et al. </em>2013). Investigate the extent to which operational wind farms could affect major breeding populations such as core populations in the Balkans (Vasilakis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Provide effective protection to the Turkish population (the largest in the Western Palearctic), specifically during breeding seasons and investigate impact of demographic bottlenecks and low genetic diversity (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a, b). At the European level, to prevent ecological barriers, stronger integration is needed in environmental policies across political borders (Arrondo <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/>The European Species Action Plan for the Conservation of the Cinereous Vulture (2017) provides a comprehensive overview of the conservation and research actions necessary to conserve this species in Europe (Andevski <em>et al. </em>2017). In addition to the above, the plan recommends: reintroducing or restoring wild ungulate populations; increasing the monitoring of poisoning of vultures; improving legal measures to reduce poisoning incidents; banning lead ammunition; and raising public awareness of the risks to Cinereous Vultures and the positives of maintaining vulture populations.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Nests are placed in a tree or shrub, with a clutch size of one (Baptista <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 1899, the species was found to breed in large numbers with <em>Ducula bicolor</em> on Burung Island (Baptista <em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>","Although little is known about the species, it may be speculated that settlement, deforestation, disturbance, hunting on small islands and the introduction of mammalian predators have caused widespread declines, as is the case for a number of other declining columbiformes.

Eaton<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Eaton 2011)<strong></strong>. Poaching to supply the pet trade may be a further threat, as exemplified by two captive birds in Hong Kong (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2009, Eaton<em> et al.</em> 2015)<strong></strong>. Habitat loss is likely to be a major threat, with extensive clearance for logging and conversion to agriculture and plantations taking place throughout the species's range (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2009, Iqbal 2010)<strong></strong>.

In the Caucasus, it occurs in steppe, lowland and riverine forests and semi-deserts. Eastern populations breed in natural steppe and agricultural habitats. Both adults and immatures of the eastern populations are migratory, wintering in the Middle East, East Africa south to Tanzania, the Arabian peninsula, the Indian Subcontinent and south and east Asia; wintering birds have also been reported in Hong Kong (China). These birds make their southward migration between September and November, returning between February and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Wetlands are apparently preferred on the wintering grounds. Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs, with small groups sometimes forming on migration or at sources of food or water (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In exceptional cases large groups of up to 200 have been known to form on autumn migration (Snow and Perrins 1998). Adults in central Europe, the Balkan peninsula, Turkey and the Caucasus are usually residents, whilst some immatures move south. Non-territorial birds often associate with other large eagles such as<em> A. clanga </em>and<em> Haliaeetus albicilla</em><em> </em>on wintering and temporary settlement areas. <p></p>","Breeding sites are threatened primarily by intensive forestry in the mountains, and by the shortage of large indigenous trees in the lowlands (e.g. illegal tree cutting affected several pairs in Russia [Karyakin <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2009a] and Bulgaria).&#160;The species is sensitive to human disturbance, which means its breeding range can be highly restricted by human presence and infrastructural development in Central Europe (and probably elsewhere in its range e.g. Karyakin<em>&#160;</em>2011) (M. Horváth <em>in litt. </em>2016). Infrastructural and settlement network was the primary cause for the absence of the species at more than 30% of its potential habitats at the Hungarian Plain (Horváth 2009).&#160;<br/>Other threats are loss and alteration of feeding habitats, shortages of small and medium-sized prey species (particularly ground-squirrels S<em style="""">permophilus </em>spp.), nest robbing and illegal trade, shooting, poisoning, electrocution by powerlines and collisions with vehicles. An average of c.450 Eastern Imperial Eagles were killed by powerlines during the 2009 breeding season in the Altai region – 25% of the total population of the region (Karyakin <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2009b). Habitat alterations associated with agricultural expansion threaten historical and potential breeding sites in former range countries. In Central Europe intentional predator poisoning became the first cause of mortality from 2006 onwards affecting more than 80 specimens in 10 years only in Hungary (Horváth <em>et al.</em> 2011, M. Horváth <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Hunting, poisoning, prey depletion and other mortality factors are also likely to pose threats along migration routes and in wintering areas. Competition for nest sites with Greater Spotted Eagle <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Aquila clanga</span> has been reported in the Altai region, Russia (Karyakin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009c).<p></p>","In Europe, the breeding population was estimated to number 1,300-1,900 breeding pairs, equating to 2,500-3,800 mature individuals. Recent population estimates from Russia and Kazakhstan suggest the global population may exceed 10,000 mature individuals, but in light of criticism of these estimates the population is precautionarily retained in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals here. This equates to 3,750-14,999 individuals in total, rounded here to 3,500-15,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species breeds in <strong>Austria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, Macedonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey </strong>and <strong>Ukraine </strong>(Heredia 1996, M. Horváth &amp; I. Karyakin <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species possibly breeds or is found in very small numbers in Armenia, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Kosovo, Moldova and Romania (BirdLife International 2015). In addition, breeding has not been proved but possibly occurs in Afghanistan, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. On passage and in winter, birds are found in the Middle East, east Africa south to Tanzania, the Arabian peninsula, the Indian Subcontinent and south and east Asia (from Thailand to Korea). The European population is estimated at 1,300-1,900 pairs, which equates to 2,500-3,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). This estimate alongside a previous estimate of 1,800-2,200 pairs for the period 2000-2010 (Demerdzhiev <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011) is higher than previous estimates of 1,051-1,619 pairs reported in 2000 (Horváth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002) and 1,110-1,624 pairs in 2008 (BirdLife International 2008, Barov and Derhé 2011), and is partly due to increased survey effort rather than a genuinely large population increase. There was a rapid decline in Europe and probably in Asia in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Recently the central European population (240-260 pairs mostly in Hungary and Slovakia [M. Horváth&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2016]) appears to have been increasing (Horváth <em>et al.</em> 2005, Demerdzhiev <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011, BirdLife International 2015) as a result of conservation efforts, although the majority of the threats to the species persist (D. Horal<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in <em>litt</em></span><em>.</em> 2012). In the last six years the occurrence of persecution incidents significantly increased (Horváth<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2011), with more than 70  Eastern Imperial Eagles poisoned in Hungary (M. Horváth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2016). The Balkan population (76-132 pairs mostly in Bulgaria and Macedonia [Demerdzhiev <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2011] ) is apparently stable (although the last proven breeding in Greece took place in 1993). Recent surveys in Azerbaijan found relatively high densities in the north-western plains, estimating 50-60 pairs within a 6,000 km<sup>2</sup> study area (Horváth <em style="""">et al.</em> 2007), and a total population size of 50-150 pairs (Horváth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008, Sultanov 2010). This suggests that the Caucasian population may have been underestimated (it was previously assumed that less than 50 pairs bred in Azerbaijan and Georgia) (Horváth <em>et al.</em> 2007), and the population of Turkey may also have been underestimated with 32 pairs found in European Turkey and another 50 in north-west Anatolia (Demerdzhiev <em>et al. </em>2014, Horváth&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). However, a large proportion of these Turkish nesting areas are threatened by intensive infrastructural development and habitat loss (M.&#160;Horváth <em>in litt. </em>&#160;2016). Populations in the Volga Region of Russia are relatively stable, but are suspected to decline in the future due to the presence of threats at breeding sites (M. Korepov and R. Bekmansurov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). At least half of the world population (and possibly more) breeds in Russia (900-1,000 pairs<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>[Belik <em>et al.</em> 2002]) and Kazakhstan (750-800 pairs [Bragin 1999]). More recent surveys conducted by Karyakin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2008, 2011, 2013) estimated 3,000-3,800 pairs in Russia and 3,200-4,000 pairs in Kazakhstan, which includes the breeding population in western Kazakhstan increasing from 1 pair in 2006 to 34 pairs in 2015, with all of the new pairs consisting of young birds (I. Karyakin <em>in litt. </em>2016). However further studies are required to gain more precise population size and trend estimates for the species in these countries.

Some patches of habitat, including the type-locality, are under constant human pressure and have been reduced by fires, allotments and landfills.

It occurred in isolated pairs, often in rather large areas, suggesting that it must have been a naturally low-density species. Breeding season was May to June in West Java (Wiersma and Kirwan 2013). It was probably resident, although it may have undergone local movements or migration, as suggested by its erratic and off-shore occurrences (van Balen and Nijman 2007). Its diet is thought to have consisted of freshwater invertebrates and plant seeds (Wiersma and Kirwan 2013).<p></p>","Its decline has been attributed to 'merciless' hunting and trapping. However, it seems far more likely that high levels of human disturbance and conversion of its habitat to aquaculture and agricultural land were the principal agents.

There is a high risk of rapid conversion of virtually all remaining habitat to plantations, which could plausibly take place over just a few years.&#160;<br/><p></p>","It occurs in a range of forest habitats (Donald <em>et al. </em>2014) including primary and secondary, regenerating, lowland semi-evergreen and bamboo forest, usually below 160 m (although with records up to 259 m [Donald <em>et al. </em>2014])&#160;in flat areas with slopes less than ten degrees, with an understorey containing <em>Salacca</em> palms, in which it nests. Recent research suggests the species uses different habitat types in Thailand and Myanmar, which is encouraging for habitat restoration work (Donald 2008). Territories are centered on gulley systems where moist conditions prevail year-round, usually with access to water, and often close to forest edge. It is likely to show ""a heavy reliance on earthworms"", in line with other members of the genus. It breeds during the wet season, between April and October. <p></p>","The key reason for its decline has been the almost total clearance of lowland forest in southern Myanmar and peninsular Thailand through clear-felling for timber, unofficial logging and conversion to croplands, fruit orchards, coffee, rubber and oil-palm plantations. Conversion of flat forest to oil-palm plantation in Myanmar&#160;is ongoing in southern Tenasserim with large concessions including significant tracts of Lenya Reserve Forest (P. Insua-Cao <em>in litt. </em>2016; see also Donald <em>et al. </em>2015). An added complication is that future deforestation rates will also be strongly influenced by internal politics in the region and the strength of the insurgency groups (P. Donald <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. A concerning recent development is the removal of the status of 'Proposed National Park' for Lenya Reserve Forest (T. D. W. Aung&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2019), indicating that the hope that this will become a strictly protected area is unwarranted.<br/><br/>In Thailand at least, snare-line trapping for the cage-bird trade was also a serious threat, and there are reports of targeted trapping in Myanmar to supply demand from Thailand (P. Insua-Cao <em>in litt. </em>2016). Predation by cat snakes (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Boiga</span> spp.) appears to limit reproductive success in Thailand. These predators are native, but may be present at a higher-than-natural density, having been favoured by habitat fragmentation in the area (Donald <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><p></p>","In Myanmar, on the basis of previously reported population densities and extent of suitable habitat, the population was estimated in 2004 to be 5,152-8,586 pairs, equating to 10,300-17,100 mature individuals, or roughly 15,000-26,000 individuals in total. More recently it has become evident that the species has suffered very rapid declines and the population in 2019 is much lower, and is now believed to be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals and may be even fewer, although there has not been an attempt to update the population estimate using the same methodology (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2015, Lay Win <em>et al. </em>2015, T. D. W. Aung&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). As such, the population is currently placed in the band 1,000-2,500 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Pitta gurneyi</em> is now restricted to few remaining areas of lowland forest in<strong>&#160;</strong>Tenasserim, <strong>Myanmar</strong><em>, </em>following what appears to be its extinction within&#160;adjacent peninsular <strong>Thailand</strong>. The species was only discovered in Myanmar in 2003, when it was found at four sites with a maximum of 10-12 pairs at one location (BirdLife International 2003, Eames&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>. It was found to be not uncommon at some sites, and on the basis of previously reported population densities and extent of suitable habitat, the population was estimated to number 5,152-8,586 pairs (Eames&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>. In 2007-2008, the species was recorded at 101 census points in Myanmar (Donald&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009). Since 1999, an estimated 81% of the available intact lowland flat forest within the range has been lost, primarily through conversion to plantations for palm oil or rubber. The extent of remaining suitable habitat was estimated at 656 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2015 (Lay Win <em>et al. </em>2015). In tandem with this habitat loss, 2016 surveys revisiting 141 points where the species had been recorded between 2003 and 2012 found that it remained only at 41 of these sites (Shwe <em>et al. </em>2018.).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Historically it was apparently common in Thailand, but there were no field observations in Thailand between 1952 and 1986 <strong></strong>(BirdLife International 2001). Since 1986, intensive surveys found it in at least five localities, although it disappeared from all but one of these, Khao Nor Chuchi, in the late 1990s. This population has declined from 44-45 pairs in 1986 to just nine pairs in 1997, most of which are outside protected-area boundaries. Detailed work in 2003-2007 recorded birds at 27 sites in Khao Nor Chuchi, and a further survey of the area in 2009 found 12 individuals responding to tape playback (Anon. 2009, Donald <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).&#160;Intensive surveys of the site in 2015 and 2016 recorded no individuals, until a single female was recorded in April 2016 (P.

In addition the project is seeking to engage major plantation concession holders within the landscape (P. Insua-Cao&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).Much effort was exerted in Thailand following its rediscovery in Thailand, which quantified the population by 1989, designated Khao Nor Chuchi as first a Non-Hunting Area in 1987, then a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1993. However, economic incentives continued to govern land-use decisions, and despite a comprehensive series of projects the population continued to decline (Round 2014). The process and key tree species for habitat restoration are understood and have been tested around Khao Nor Chuchi (Elliott&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and a tree nursery was created (Anon. 2009).

This trend currently shows no sign of reversing, and immediate conservation action is required to prevent further declines. Recent count data for the number of breeding pairs suggests that the rate of decline may actually have increased in recent years. If the estimated rate of population decline is confirmed to have accelerated, the species may require uplisting.&#160;<p></p>","<p><strong>Behaviour </strong>Adults are largely resident, but some movements occur in response to prey movements (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Adults generally remain within 400 km of their breeding locality, although they have been recorded up to 900 km away (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005, Roberts 2015). They breed and moult on land before taking to the sea, where they can remain for up to four months (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Roberts 2015). On gaining independence, juveniles disperse up to 2,000 km from their natal colonies, with those from the east heading west, and those from the west and south moving north (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2017). Most birds later return to their natal colony to moult and breed (Randall <em>et al.</em> 1987, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2014a), although the growth of some colonies has been attributed to the immigration of first-time breeders tracking food availability (Crawford 1998, Crawford<em> et al. </em>2013).<strong> </strong>Adults nest colonially, but may also nest in isolation. At sea they forage singly, in pairs or sometimes co-operatively in small groups of up to 150 individuals (Wilson <em>et al. </em>1986, Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Ryan<em> et al. </em>2012, McInnes <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). African Penguins forage more successfully in groups when feeding on schooling fish (McInnes <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;The species breeds year round with peak months varying locally (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the north-western part of the range, peak laying occurs during the months of November to January; in the south-west it occurs between May and July, and in the east between April and June (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2013). The average age at first breeding is thought to be 4-6 years (Whittington <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2005). </p><p><strong>Habitat </strong>This species is marine and usually found within 40 km of the coast (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 1988, Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2006, Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2012), coming ashore on islands or at non-contiguous areas of the mainland coast to breed, moult and rest (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <em>Breeding: </em>Breeding habitats range from flat, sandy islands with varying degrees of vegetation cover, to steep rocky islands with little vegetation (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). African Penguins are sometimes found close to the summit of islands and may move over a kilometre inland in search of breeding sites (Hockey 2001). They usually feed within 20 km of the colony when breeding, although at some colonies the distance is greater (Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2009, Waller 2011, Ludynia<em> et al.</em> 2012, Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;<em>Non-breeding: </em>At sea, their distribution is mainly restricted to the greater Benguela Current region (Williams 1995).&#160;Juveniles have been observed to travel ~600 km from their natal colonies (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2017), while immatures up to 700 km with an average of ~370 km from the colony (Grigg and Sherley 2019).&#160; Pre- and post moulting adults have been observed up to 550 km from their colonies (de Blocq <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;</p><p><strong>Diet</strong> Adults feed predominantly on pelagic schooling fish of 50-120 mm length, with important prey including sardine <em>Sardinops sagax,</em> anchovy <em>Engraulis capensis</em>, bearded goby <em>Sufflogobius bibarbatus</em> and round herring <em>Etrumeus </em><em>whiteheadi</em> (Crawford <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1985, Ludynia <em>et al.</em> 2010, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2011). In some localities, cephalopods represent an important food source (Crawford <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1985, Connan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Juveniles are thought to prey on fish larvae (Wilson 1985).<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Breeding site </strong>In the past, nests were usually built in burrows dug in guano or sand (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1976a, Shelton <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1984). Today, with the lack of guano at most colonies, nesting in open areas has become increasingly common (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2012, Pichegru 2013). At some sites, artificial nest-burrows made from pipes and boxes sunken into the ground, and shelters shaped from dry vegetation have been regularly used by the species (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2012, Pichegru 2013).   </p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Population declines have been attributed to food shortages resulting from shifts in the distributions of prey species, competition with commercial purse-seine fisheries and environmental fluctuations (e.g. Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2011). A decrease in foraging effort at St Croix Island (Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2012, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2019b) and an increase in chick survival and chick condition at Robben Island (Sherley <em>et al. </em>2015,&#160; 2018, 2019b) following the establishment of 20 km no-take zones provides some support for this theory. In the early 2000s, there was an eastward shift in sardine and anchovy stocks, with the mature biomass of these species decreasing near the breeding islands north of Cape Town (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2011). The abundance of these prey species is known to influence foraging success (Campbell <em>et al. </em>2019, McInnes <em>et al.</em> 2019), breeding success (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2006, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2013b), adult survival (Sherley <em>et al. </em>2014a, Robinson <em>et al. </em>2015), and juvenile survival (Weller <em>et al. </em>2016; Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2017), all of which may often be too low off South Africa’s west coast to maintain population equilibrium (Weller<em> et al. </em>2014, 2016). Western Cape populations declined by 69% between 2001-2009, considered at least partly due to this climate-induced shift in fish stocks. African penguin fledglings travelled to areas of low sea surface temperatures and high chlorophyll-a which were historically reliable cues for fish availability.&#160; Climate change and industrial fishing have depleted forage fish in these areas, resulting in an ecological trap for the species and associated low juvenile survival (Sherley<em> et al. </em>2017).&#160; In Namibia, where sardine and anchovy are virtually absent from the foraging ranges of breeding penguins, breeding birds feed principally on the energy-poor Bearded Goby <em>Sufflogobius bibarbatus</em> (Ludynia <em>et al. </em>2010). Limited penguin mortality in fishing nets may increase if gill-nets are set near colonies (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1998, Crawford <em>et al. </em>2017).</p><p>Human disturbance and egg-collecting were important factors in the decline of the species in the early 20th century (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1976b, Ellis<em> et al.</em> 1998, Shannon and Crawford 1999). While egg collection is now illegal.&#160; an incident of egg poaching was recorded in South Africa in 2016 (Brophy 2016). Guano collection was historically a major cause of disturbance at many colonies and the removal of guano deprived penguins of nest-burrowing sites, causing birds to nest on open ground where they are more vulnerable to heat stress resulting in the abandonment of nests, flooding of nests by rain, and increased predation (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1976b, Shannon and Crawford 1999, Pichegru 2013, Kemper 2015). Guano harvesting is no longer practiced in South Africa, and, according to the Namibian Island’s Marine Protected Area Regulations, guano scraping is not permitted following the expiry of existing guano rights for Ichaboe Island in 2016 (MRA 27 of 2000). <br/><br/>Both chronic oil pollution and individual large oil spills appear to have long-term significant impacts on colonies. Past mortality from oil spills has been serious (Wolfaardt <em>et al.</em> 2009) and may increase if proposed development of harbours close to colonies proceeds. Most of the population is confined to areas that are near existing or planned major shipping ports (Nel and Whittington 2003, J. Kemper pers. comm.). There has been a dramatic increase in the number of birds oiled since 1990: two individual oil spills (in 1994 and 2000) killed 30,000 individuals, despite successful rehabilitation programmes (Nel and Whittington 2003, Wolfaardt <em>et al. </em>2008, 2009). Ship to ship bunkering activities off the south east coast in Algoa Bay in 2016 and 2019, resulted in 200 African penguins and 125 seabirds oiled respectively (SANCCOB unpubl. data).&#160; Breeding success on Robben Island fell to 0.23 chicks per pair in 2000, compared with an average of 0.62 ±0.19 over the other 15 years from 1989 to 2004 (Crawford<em> et al.</em> 2006). Rehabilitation does not necessarily prevent problems in the years after a spill. During 2001-2005, pairs involving at least one bird rehabilitated from the oil spill in 2000 achieved lower fledging success (43%) compared to unaffected pairs (61%) and those involving at least one bird affected by a previous oil spill (71%), mostly owing to higher mortality in older chicks (Barham <em>et al.</em> 2007). This may indicate physiological or behavioural problems that reduce the parents ability to meet the food requirements of older chicks, perhaps owing to the toxicity of the heavy oil in the 2000 spill; the effects of prolonged captivity; or the time between oiling and washing (Barham <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p><p>The Cape Fur Seal <em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em> competes with penguins for food, displaces them from breeding sites and imposes significant mortality at some colonies (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 1989, Makhado <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weller <em>et al.</em> 2016, MFMR unpubl. data). Modelling of the interaction of multiple pressures on the colonies at Robben and Dyer Islands indicate that predation by Cape Fur Seals is a key driver in current population declines at Dyer Island (Weller <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, this was found to be in addition to immature emigration, suggesting there may be additional bottom-up pressures impacting the viability of colonies.</p><p>The potential effects of individual storms on breeding colonies at certain sites has been highlighted (de Villiers 2002) and, as such, the increased frequency and severity of storms may cause localised losses. Sharks take some birds at sea and Kelp Gulls <em>Larus dominicanus</em>, dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> and feral cats <em>Felis catus </em>prey on eggs and chicks at colonies (Underhill<em> et al. </em>2006, Pichegru 2013, Weller<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016). In some mainland colonies, predation by mongooses <em>Herpestes </em>spp., leopards <em>Panthera pardus&#160;</em>and caracals <em>Caracal caracal</em>, or illegal egg collection may have notable impacts (e.g. Underhill <em>et al.</em> 2006), with the Simonstown colony experiencing considerable mortality due to caracal (SANParks and City of Cape Town, unpubl. data, Vanstreels <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;</p><p>While a number of diseases have been documented in African penguins, few records of mass mortality through disease have been observed in the wild, up until 2018 and 2019, when a high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain killed approximately 100 penguins in South Africa and up to 600 in Namibia respectively (Khomenko <em>et al.</em> 2018, Molini <em>et al.</em> 2020)&#160; &#160;</p><br/><p>  </p>","<p>In 2015, the overall number of pairs was about 20,850 pairs, or 41,700 mature individuals (Sherley <em>et al. </em>2019a).

It has been recorded as far north as Gabon and Mozambique (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>  </p><p>In Namibia, Neglectus Islet and Penguin Island were recolonised in 2001 and 2006 respectively (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007a). In the 1980s, the species colonised Stony Point and Boulders Beach on the South African mainland and recolonised Robben Island, all in the southwest of the country (Underhill <em>et al</em>. 2006). A colony formed on the southern mainland at De Hoop in 2003, but disappeared after 2007. The northernmost colony at Lambert’s Bay became extinct in 2006 (Underhill <em>et al</em>. 2006, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2011). </p><p>In 2015, the population for Namibia was estimated at 5,700 to 5,800 pairs (MFMR <em>unpubl. data</em>), the uncertainty in the estimate arising from a few islands that had not been counted for several years (J.

Just seven colonies now support 97% of the South African population. Recent declines at South African colonies are coincident with changes in the abundance and availability of forage fish and an eastward movement of spawning forage fish (Crawford<em> et al.</em> 2011, Waller 2011, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2014a).&#160;</p><p>  </p>","Previously egg-collecting and guano harvesting were carried out at a significant scale, but both have now ceased and are prohibited or illegal.

CMS Appendix II. US Endangered Species Act. Continuous monitoring of population trends is carried out at all colonies annually in South Africa but less regularly in Namibia. In South Africa, most breeding localities are national parks or nature reserves. The colonies at Simonstown and Stony Point are in the process of receiving formal protection status. Collection of guano and eggs is prohibited within penguin colonies (Harrison <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Currie <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/>The Namibian Islands’ Marine Protected Area (NIMPA), proclaimed in 2009, protects almost 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> of ocean in southern Namibia, including all penguin breeding localities and key foraging habitats (Currie <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ludynia <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/>Oiled birds are rehabilitated with success (Barham <em>et al.</em> 2007, Wolfaardt <em>et al</em>. 2008). More than 80% of birds admitted for rehabilitation are returned successfully to the wild (Nel and Whittington 2003). <br/>Lost nesting habitat has been augmented using artificial nests at a number of colonies. Some designs have proved successful, increasing breeding success (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2012). At other locations, the same designs have not been as successful (Pichegru 2013, Lei <em>et al.</em> 2014). The optimal design of artificial nests is currently being researched. Maintenance of natural breeding habitat takes place where possible. <br/>Research into foraging behaviour using biologging technology (GPS and satellite-transmitters) is ongoing (Ludynia 2007, Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2010, Waller 2011, Ludynia <em>et al.</em> 2012, Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2012, Waller 2011, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Campbell<em> et al.</em> 2019, BirdLife South Africa unpubl. data). In South Africa, a research project into the potential positive impacts of small marine no-take zones surrounding breeding colonies is underway. Results suggest a decrease in adult foraging effort and increases in chick survival and condition, but not uniformly across the colonies involved (Pichegru <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010, 2012;<strong> </strong>Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2018, 2019b). South Africa declared new Marine Protected Areas in 2019, including around some of the seabird colonies, but they are largely ineffective in protecting penguin foraging habitat. <br/>Population reinforcement through hand rearing of abandoned chicks, or chicks removed from nests in compromised areas where survival was unlikely, added over 7000 fledglings to the population between 2001 and 2019. These hand-reared fledglings survive and recruit in to breeding populations at similar rates to their wild counterparts (Sherley<em> et al.</em> 2014b). Attempts are made to decrease predation of eggs, chicks and grown birds (e.g. Makhado <em>et al</em>. 2013, Pichegru 2013). A national (South African) capture-mark-recapture programme using Passive Integrated Transponders has been implemented to monitor survival, recruitment and movements amongst colonies.</p><p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/> In South Africa, the African penguin Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP), gazetted in 2013, guided the conservation actions to be implemented with the aim to halt the decline of the species. This 5-year BMP included the above actions and identified additional ones, such as: ensuring adequate prey for penguins during the breeding and non-breeding seasons; spatial management of the pelagic fishery; investigating conservation translocations in this species; improving the disaster response to oiling, disease and fire; establish minimum standards for rehabilitation and rehabilitation facilities; improving penguin numbers through targeted interventions at existing but declining breeding localities where the reasons for the decline can be addressed.&#160;<br/>This plan did not achieve its aims, and a revised plan has been prepared for the next 5 years and is expected to be approved for implementation in 2020. Threats such as predation and disaster prevention and mitigation are addressed in this plan as well as conservation translocations, habitat improvement and ongoing essential population monitoring and disease surveillance. Critically, actions dealing with the food availability threat with protecting at sea habitat and the management of resources that are critical for the penguin’s survival at all phases in its life-cycle are included.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>  </p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

As such, while declines over the next three generations are not expected to exceed thresholds for listing as threatened,&#160;future climate scenarios predict a rapid increase in the rate of population decline, such that without mitigation the species will begin to decline rapidly within one to two generations.","Emperor Penguins are high latitude, ice obligate seabirds; they breed throughout the austral winter, are highly cold adapted and spend their entire lives in the Antarctic region, generally in association with sea ice. The vast majority of colonies are dependent upon land-fast sea ice, which they use as breeding habitat, and upon pack ice that they use as foraging habitat. <br/><br/>Information for most colonies is based upon remote sensing, only available recently, as colony access by researchers is limited. Nevertheless, the general life cycle of the species is reasonably well understood, especially for adults at colonies in the north of the species range.&#160;<br/>Breeding takes place almost exclusively on coastal land-fast sea ice, sometimes tens of kilometers from ocean access.&#160;Only one known colony occurs wholly on land, where the gradation from fast ice to land ice is continuous (Robertson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2014), while a small number uses available land for parts of their breeding cycle. Four colonies are known to locate at least temporarily onto the top of ice shelves (Fretwell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Emperor Penguins breed throughout the austral winter. They arrive at their colonies in late March to April, and lay eggs in May to June. Chicks hatch after about 65 days and fledge in December to January (Stonehouse 1953; Prévost 1953, 1961). Chicks disperse widely often heading north into waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Kooyman and Ponganis 2008, Wienecke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Labrousse&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). Adults moult in summer (January to March) and may travel up to 1200 km to areas of seasonally persistent pack ice, suitable for haul out for several weeks (Kooyman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004).<br/><br/>Emperor Penguins feed mainly on fish, krill and cephalopods. The relative importance of these dietary items varies with colony location and season (Cherel and Kooyman 1998, Kirkwood and Robertson 1997, Klages 1989, Wienecke and Robertson 1997)","<p>The species is threatened by the effects of projected climate change, primarily through ongoing and future decreases in sea ice concentration, thickness and duration, which are affected by wind speed and persistence, as well as changes in other climatic variables that affect ocean properties (e.g. Ainley <em>et al.</em> 2010; Jenouvrier <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2017, 2020). Global emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuels and industry have increased on average by &gt;1.5% per year between 2008 and 2017 (Le Quéré <em>et al. </em>2018), and by 1.7% in 2018 leading to a concentration of 407.4 ppm in the atmosphere, despite reductions in some developing countries (Le Quéré <em>et al.</em> 2019). Similarly, atmospheric methane has grown very rapidly each year between 2014 and 2017, and the climate warming impact of methane, if continued at &gt;5 ppb per year in the coming decades, will be highly significant (Nisbit <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>Most climate models agree that future global climate change will lead to reductions in sea ice area of close to 30% (or 40%) in the latter part of the 21st century following medium (or high) emissions scenarios (Bracegirdle <em>et al. </em>2008, 2015, Palerme<em> et al.</em> 2017) and therefore will affect Emperor Penguins (Ainley <em>et al. </em>2010; Jenouvrier <em>et al. </em>2014, 2017). However, it is important to note that already by mid-century, Emperor Penguins are highly likely to be affected as a destabilization of their breeding platforms prior to fledging, seriously diminishes their chances of breeding successfully.</p><p>The decrease of a colony on Emperor Island from c.150 pairs in the 1970s to fewer than 20 pairs by 1999, with the apparent disappearance of the colony by 2009, has been linked to a decrease in seasonally stable sea ice suitable for breeding (Trathan<em> et al.</em> 2011); in the west Antarctic Peninsula region, there has been a statistically significant negative trend in sea ice in March, over the satellite era (IPCC 2019). The colony appears to have moved to a location with more stable ice (LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>In recent years, until 2014, circumpolar Antarctic sea ice had increased in extent. In September 2014, the extent was over 20.11 million km<sup>2</sup>. Antarctic sea ice extent then rapidly decreased, but since 2016 has increased (IPCC 2019), but remained below the long-term average (see nsidc.org/data/seaice_index; accessed 2 January 2020). Trends in sea ice extent are potentially independent of changes in coastal fast ice: e.g. altered winds may lead to more extensive large-scale sea ice, but possibly reduced fast ice (Ainley <em>et al. </em>2010). Nevertheless, in the long-term, the loss of large-scale sea ice in general means that ultimately fast ice is also affected. Modelled projections of sea ice remain a key issue, including uncertainty about recent sea ice anomalies. As the Antarctic continues to change, hence so too does Emperor Penguin habitat. In the long term, Emperor Penguin habitat is likely to deteriorate to a point where suitable locations occur only in restricted refugia or, in the worst case scenario, may be completely unavailable (Jenouvrier<em> et al.</em> 2020).</p><p>The relocation of Emperor Penguin colonies will be limited by decreases in sea ice thickness and duration, making it more difficult for them to find stable, long-lasting fast ice for breeding (Ainley&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010). Colonies could conceivably move to any area of coastline where breeding habitat remains (e.g. LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2015, Trathan and Fretwell 2019). However, importantly, a simple latitudinal gradient in the loss of sea ice has not occurred and is unlikely in the future (Zwally&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2002, Turner <em>et al.</em> 2009, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2011, Stammerjohn <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fretwell <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p>Reductions in sea ice concentration and duration reduce the buffering capacity of sea ice to shield fast ice from ocean wave energy (Kim <em>et al. </em>2018). Such energy can contribute to disintegration of breeding habitat. In addition, basal melting of glacier around the Antarctic continent is increasing, potentially leading to further destabilization of Antarctic sea ice (Bronselaer <em>et al.</em> 2018, Massom <em>et al.</em> 2018, Rignot <em>et al.</em> 2019, Shen <em>et al.</em> 2018). Thus, existing and potential breeding areas of Emperor Penguins are subject to a variety of pressures and much uncertainty.</p><p>Out of the water, Emperor Penguins are not agile and cannot easily negotiate rough terrain; they are unable to ascend steep slopes, especially with eggs or small chicks, and require relatively flat, gradual access, either to sea ice, or to beaches (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2019). Loss of suitable breeding habitat is therefore one of the most important challenges that Emperor Penguins face. Recently, breeding on ice shelves has been reported (Fretwell <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, this was only possible where the ablation of shelf fronts or the presence of snow bridges enabled access. Similar opportunities in the future may remain limited, as access varies between years (Zitterbart <em>et al.</em> 2014). In a warming environment potentially causing increased calving of ice shelves, opportunities for this might change. Furthermore, if the rates of flow of ice shelves alter, surfaces may be more highly crevassed. In the long-term, moving onto ice shelves may not be a viable strategy (Fretwell <em>et al. </em>2014). Ice-free ground is rare in Antarctica (less than 1% of Antarctica; Burton-Johnson <em>et al. </em>2016) and the probability that suitable rock areas will emerge is difficult to predict.<br/> <br/> Another threat to Emperor Penguins is a change in food availability; changes to ocean circulation due to increasing melt of Antarctic ice may interfere with the natural processes that bring nutrients and carbon from the deep ocean back to the surface waters (Lago &amp; England 2019). How this will affect marine organisms, especially those that penguins rely on for food, is as yet unknown. Furthermore, fisheries for Antarctic silverfish <em>Pleuragramma antarcticum</em>, part of the diet of Emperor Penguins, could be developed in the future. Harvesting of silverfish and Antarctic krill <em>Euphausia superba </em>could pose a threat, if management does not adequately take into account the needs of species that feed upon these species. Protection of habitat at sea is important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging, moulting and rafting areas at sea.</p><p>              Human disturbance is a threat in some areas, where problems to colonies are caused by the proximity to scientific bases and aircraft movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Sites visited by tourists collectively account for a very small percentage of the global population (J. Croxall <em>in litt. </em>2017), but the impacts of tourism on breeding penguins remain uncertain (Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2019). Other human impacts potentially include disturbance from researchers, construction of new science facilities and Antarctic krill fisheries. Oil spills may also be important at local scales.</p>","<p>A survey of satellite images from 2009, updated in 2019 considered 54 colonies containing approximately 256,500 breeding pairs to be a plausible breeding population estimate (Trathan <em>et al. </em>2019). The numbers of juveniles, sub-adults and non-breeders are unknown, and the small colonies found since 2014 are not included.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em> has a circumpolar range with approximately 54 breeding colonies located around the entire coast of <strong>Antarctica</strong>, (Trathan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2019). The largest colonies (&gt; 15,000 breeding pairs) occur in the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea. In recent years, some colonies may have relocated (Ancel <em>et al.</em> 2014, LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2015, Fretwell and Trathan 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>Future reduction in the suitable breeding habitat is strongly predicted (Jenouvrier <em>et al. </em>2020) with major changes predicted from the middle of the current century (Bronselaer <em>et al. </em>2018). The breeding habitat of Emperor Penguins is discontinuous, and only a seasonal feature. Extent, thickness and duration of sea ice are all changing, with regional differences. Refugia may continue to exist in the higher latitude Weddell Sea and Ross Sea, but the areas suitable as breeding habitat are likely to be only a fraction of those currently available.&#160;</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is the subject of on-going international research. Most on-the-ground studies have been undertaken at colonies in the northern part of the species range. Less is known about the southern colonies in the Ross Sea or Weddell Sea, where the intensity of winter darkness is much greater and it is colder. Pair bonding, breeding, and laying occur later in these high-latitude colonies (G Kooyman <em>in litt.</em> 2019). The natural history beyond post-moult and before return for breeding are unknown and&#160; only one study, conducted in the eastern Ross Sea, focused on non-breeders (Goetz <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/>Human disturbance is regulated in some areas; to date, seven active breeding sites are designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA), and seven are protected by the Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area (RSR MPA), of which three are also designated ASPAs. More colonies may eventually become protected. MPAs may afford protection for different life history processes, including potentially breeding, foraging and moulting, as MPAs may provide for more comprehensive protection than do ASPAs. MPAs are essential to protect food resources while ASPAs only protect breeding areas: the RSR MPA will protect over 1.5 million km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of the Southern Ocean from commercial fishing over the next 35 years (Australian Birdlife 2016).<br/>Currently however, the RSR MPA protects only one of the Emperor Penguin meta-populations proposed by Younger <em>et al.</em> (2015, 2017). Protection of more genetically distinct meta-populations might be important for future resilience to environmental change.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct regular satellite surveys to monitor population trends in the context of habitat availability (e.g. Fretwell <em>et al. </em>2012, LaRue <em>et al. </em>2015). Continue monitoring at the individual level and ground-based monitoring of some colonies located along a latitudinal gradient to estimate demographic parameters and their responses to environmental change (e.g. Barbraud and Weimerskirch 2001, Ancel <em>et al.</em> 2014, Jenouvrier <em>et al. </em>2014, Robertson<em> et al.</em> 2014, Kooyman and Ponganis 2016).&#160; Continue to improve on existing modelling work to improve predictions of future population changes (see Jenouvrier <em>et al.</em> 2019). Carry out further research into the species' marine ecology (e.g. age-specific migration routes/distances and foraging strategies) and meta-population structure (e.g. Cristofari <em>et al.</em> 2016; Younger <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2017) to improve understanding of how environmental changes will affect the population. Continue to monitor Antarctic sea ice as well as other environmental variables and processes to assess the availability of suitable breeding habitat and foraging grounds.

157660553,22697758,Pygoscelis adeliae,Least Concern,,2020,2020-09-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The population has been stable or increasing recently throughout most of its breeding range, particularly in East Antarctica, the Ross Sea and on the southern Antarctic Peninsula south of 66° S (Sailley <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lyver <em>et al</em>. 2014, Southwell 2015a,b). This contrasts with the well-documented population decrease among colonies on the South Orkney Islands (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2016) and on the west coast of the northern Antarctic Peninsula (e.g. Fraser <em>et al</em>. 1992, Lynch<em> et al</em>. 2012, Cimino <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Modelling exercises now replicate some of the strongest population changes observed (Che-Castaldo <em>et al</em>. 2017). East Antarctic regional and Ross Sea populations have almost doubled in abundance since the 1980s and have been increasing, or stable, since the earliest counts in the 1960s (Taylor and Wilson 1990, Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Lyver <em>et al</em>. 2014, Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2015a, Southwell and Emmerson 2019). The population changes are associated with five-year lagged changes in the physical environment, suggesting that the changing environment impacts primarily on the pre-breeding age classes (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2015a,b). Recently, improved reporting of some large colonies, including mega-colonies on the Danger Islands (Borowicz <em>et al</em>. 2018), also highlight the probable stability of the colonies on the north eastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, though further studies would help reduce uncertainty in this region.<br/><br/>Currently, the net change in world population is positive (Lynch and LaRue 2014), which, along with the size of its total population numbering in the millions, qualifies the species to be listed as Least Concern. However, modelled projections suggest a future decrease at a circumpolar scale (Ainley <em>et al</em>. 2010). The species is considered to be an ice obligate (Ainley 2002), and recent population increases are coincident with increasing sea ice extent and coastal polynya persistence (cf Ainley <em>et al</em>. 2005, Massom and Stammerjohn 2010, Massonnet <em>et al</em>. 2015, Parkinson 2019), although at some sites, too much ice during critical times in the breeding season can reduce breeding success (Massom <em>et al</em>. 2006, Emmerson and Southwell 2008, Ropert-Coudert <em>et al</em>. 2018a). It will be important to review such coincident trends on a regular basis.","This species nests on ice-free rocky coasts, often in extensive open areas to accommodate typically large colonies, which may be far from the open sea at the time of arrival (Emmerson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Females lay one, or more usually two eggs, which are incubated by both sexes in alternating shifts.<br/><br/>The species mainly feeds on krill, fish, amphipods, cephalopods and jellyfish (Thiebot <em>et al</em>. 2016), though these latter three taxa are probably of minor importance.&#160;It captures such prey by pursuit-diving to maximally 150-180 m, with the majority of foraging down to 30 m (Watanuki <em>et al</em>. 1997, Lyver&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Ropert-Coudert <em>et al</em>. 2018b), becoming deeper as shallow prey are depleted at least off large colonies (cf Ainley <em>et al</em>. 2015, Cimino <em>et al</em>. 2016b) during the summer breeding period. During winter, dives tend to be deeper than during summer (maximally to 130 m), with foraging constrained by short day-length (Takahashi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Adélie Penguins tend to winter far enough north that there is some daylight each day (Ballard <em>et al</em>. 2010), as they are hesitant to dive into the water during darkness for fear of not being able to see predators (Ainley and Ballard 2011).<br/><br/>The species is migratory. Patterns of movement are well-known for adults during breeding, with foraging within 10-180 km of the coast depending upon colony size (Ballance <em>et al</em>. 2009). Foraging trips can be as far as 380 km during the incubation period (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2006). During the non-breeding period, adults move into the pack-ice up to 1,000-2,500 km from the breeding colony, depending upon the distance to the sea ice edge (e.g. Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2003, Ballard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Dunn<em> et al</em>. 2011, Hinke <em>et al</em>. 2015, Takahashi <em>et al</em>. 2018, Thiebot <em>et al</em>. 2019, Warwick-Evans <em>et al</em>. 2019). In most cases, this involves moving to the north, although individuals in the northern Antarctic Peninsula shift east or west, and those of the central western Antarctic Peninsula shift south; previously, when winter sea ice was more persistent, there was little movement, with many individuals remaining in the vicinity of their colony sites year round (Parmelee <em>et al</em>. 1977). Patterns of movement for juveniles are poorly known, but during their first year they remain in the pack-ice (Ainley <em>et al</em>. 1984).","The global population has been exhibiting a net increase (Lynch and LaRue 2014). The population on the west coast of the northern Antarctic Peninsula is beginning to stabilize after decades of significant decrease (Fountain<em> et al. </em>2016). Recent reports of the sizes of the mega-colonies at the Danger Islands on the east ice-bound coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (Borowicz <em>et al</em>. 2018) also suggest that populations in this area are probably stable. Results of computer modelling work suggests that the net overall increase will continue in the near term, but that net population change may reverse in the future if climate change continues on its current track. An analysis by Ainley <em>et al. </em>(2010) indicates that owing to sea ice retraction, all colonies north of 67-68°S could be lost by the time that Earth's average tropospheric temperature reaches 2.0°C above pre-industrial levels, with negative impacts on all colonies north of 70°S, despite limited growth south of 73°S. In this study, 2042 is the median year (range 2025-2052) at which a 2.0°C warming is predicted, based on the four climate models in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) that most closely replicate recent environmental conditions and trends in the Southern Ocean (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 2010). More recent model predictions are consistent, though freshening of coastal water by ice-shelf melt may delay slightly the predicted overall decrease in Antarctic sea ice (Bronslaer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Colonies along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula that are experiencing novel conditions due to increased sea surface temperature and reduced sea ice seasonal persistence were found to be decreasing or to have an unknown trend, strongly supporting ongoing physical changes as a driver of population change in the species (Cimino <em>et al.</em> 2016a). Furthermore, annual migration and winter survival may be negatively affected by decreases in sea ice coverage at northern latitudes (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 2010, Ballard <em>et al.</em> 2010, Emmerson and Southwell 2011, Hinke <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, a simple latitudinal gradient in sea ice loss is unlikely, as change so far has been regional in the Antarctic (Zwally <em>et al.</em> 2002, Turner <em>et al.</em> 2009, Massom and Stammerjohn 2010, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fretwell <em>et al.</em> 2012). During the summer, nesting habitat in the Antarctic Peninsula has been affected by an increase in the incidence of severe snowfall (Fraser <em>et al.</em> 2013, Cimino <em>et al</em>. 2019), which is consistent with climate models (Turner <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ainley <em>et al</em>. 2010). On the basis of this and more recent modelling (Cimino <em>et al. </em>2016a), as well as continuously improved understanding relating to climate change impacts (e.g. Fraser <em>et al</em>. 1992, 2013, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ropert-Coudert <em>et al</em>. 2019), it will be vital to periodically review population responses to ongoing climate variability and change. It currently remains a challenge to extrapolate population trends, due to significant unexplained interannual variability in abundances (Che-Castaldo <em>et al. </em>2017), suggesting improved understanding is needed about, for example, prey availability, competing species and demographic change (i.e. estimates of change in adult and juvenile survival, age of forest breeding or reproductive success by age).<br/><br/>Population trajectories in some locations have been considered in relation to the historical depletion and subsequent recovery of trophically competing cetacean or fur seal populations (Ainley <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, Trivelpiece <em>et al</em>. 2011) and possibly more recently the depletion of competing fish (Ainley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further studies to understand foodweb connections that involve Adélie Penguins, their prey and species that compete for the same resource will be important, as such information will help in understanding unexplained interannual variability in abundance.<br/><br/>Flightlessness and proximity to Antarctic stations (over 1 million birds breed within 10 km of stations in East Antarctica; Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2017) and associated traffic makes the species susceptible to pollution (Culik <em>et al.</em> 1991) and mortality from oiling. For example, the 1989 <em>Bahia Paraiso</em> oil spill near Palmer (Culik <em>et al.</em> 1991) was estimated to have killed 16% of local penguins. The risk of future spills remains, with potential for similar local scale impacts (Trathan <em>et al</em>. 2015, J. Croxall <em>in litt. </em>2017, Ropert-Coudert <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>The location of research stations near colonies has also led to reductions in suitable ground for breeding, excessive visits to colonies and disturbance caused by aircraft movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although the impact of disturbance in relation to environmental conditions appears to vary with location (Bricher <em>et al.</em> 2008) and only impacts a small minority of sites. Human impacts potentially include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries, particularly those targeting Antarctic krill. Harvesting of krill could be a threat, if no ecosystem-based management is implemented to properly take into account the needs of species that feed upon krill (Agnew 1997). Relevant (overlapping) fisheries are CCAMLR-regulated, and though unlikely to overlap with the majority of the population (J. Croxall <em>in litt.</em> 2017, Trathan <em>et al</em>. 2018, Warwick-Evans <em>et al</em>. 2018), consideration will be needed where they do overlap. Protection of habitat on land and at sea remains important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging and moulting. Increased understanding about the potential impact of tourism development on colonies in the northern part of the range will be important, given the growing number of tourists visiting the Antarctic (cf Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2019).","<p>The total global population was previously estimated at c.2.37 million breeding pairs (range 1.83-2.88 million pairs), equating to 4.74 million breeding individuals, based on survey data collated up to the mid-1990s (Woehler 1993, Woehler and Croxall 1997). More recently, Lynch and La Rue (2014) estimated the global breeding population to be 3.79 million pairs (range 3.52-4.10 million pairs) spread amongst 190-250 colonies (depending on the definition of a colony), equating to 7.58 million breeding individuals, based largely on satellite imagery of breeding colonies obtained between 2006 and 2011. These estimates do not include mature individuals that have skipped breeding in a season, which have been estimated to comprise up to 20% of the total breeding-age population (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2017), nor pre-breeding individuals (the species not beginning to breed until an average of 4-5 years; Ainley 2002). The global population of breeding-aged individuals is thus likely to be around 10 million mature individuals; the total population including both mature and pre-breeding birds is around 14-16 million individuals (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/></p>",Increasing,"<p><em>Pygoscelis adeliae</em> breeds on land, but is a sea ice obligate species. It is found along the entire <strong>Antarctic</strong> coast and at some of its nearby islands. Individuals are dispersive in the post-breeding and winter periods, moving towards areas of persistent sea ice to moult after breeding (Trivelpiece and Fraser 1996, Ainley 2002, Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2003, Ainley <em>et al.</em> 2010, Hinke <em>et al</em>. 2014, Warwick-Evans <em>et al</em>. 2019). Many colonies are associated with polynyas as well as with cross-shelf troughs and canyons (Fraser and Trivelpiece 1996, Ainley 2002, Arrigo and van Dijken 2003).<br/><br/>Numbers are increasing in Victoria Land in the Ross Sea (Lyver <em>et al</em>. 2014) and in other areas of East Antarctica (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2015a). They are also increasing in the southern Antarctic Peninsula regions (Sailley<em> et al.</em> 2013, Lyver <em>et al.</em> 2014, Southwell <em>et al. </em>2015a), but are decreasing or stable in parts of the northern Peninsula region (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fountain <em>et al.</em> 2016). Two mega-colonies on the Danger Islands (Borowicz <em>et al</em>. 2018) highlight the probable stability of the colonies in the colder north-eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula, where sea ice prevalence has remained little changed. The net global population has increased over the last 30 years (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 2010, Lynch and LaRue 2014, Che-Castaldo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Analyses based on the modelling of climate effects indicates the possibility that the global population could start to decrease after the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Ainley <em>et al. </em>2010, D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2012). These projected decreases may only commence after a warming of 2.0°C above pre-industrial levels has been reached; the projected overall global trend will potentially be positive before this point (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2012). There still remains considerable uncertainty in these projections due to the inherent difficulty of modelling the species complex interactions with both physical and biological processes and the evolving skills of climate modelling (Ainley <em>et al</em>. 2010, Bronselaer <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong></strong><br/>This is one of the most studied penguin or seabird species (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Ainley 2002) and is the subject of on-going research throughout its circumpolar range. A number of breeding sites are designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs), especially in regions with human traffic. The foraging areas of some colonies are located within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area (RSR MPA) protects a number of colonies, though not moulting areas; other proposed MPAs elsewhere in Antarctica should afford protection for other colonies. Well-designated MPAs, coupled with protection at breeding sites, through either MPAs or ASPAs, are likely to be the most effective means for conservation, as both breeding sites and foraging areas will then be protected.<br/>Human disturbance and scientific research are strictly regulated. <br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong></strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends and relate to the extent and persistence of sea ice and associated climatic variables.

However, recent population estimates suggest that the future prospect of some subpopulations or subspecies is of some concern, particularly that of the Eastern White-bearded Wildebeest (which, it seems, may have undergone a precipitous decline in numbers). Furthermore, several subpopulations remain entirely dependent on management regimes, particularly the migratory wildebeest population of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, which accounts for some 70% of total population numbers.","This species occurs in short-grass plains, and bordering Acacia savanna open bushland and woodland in drier areas. Serengeti wildebeests thrive on short grasslands on alkaline and volcanic soils during the rainy season, and withdraw to longer grasslands in areas of higher rainfall and permanent water during the dry season. They are rarely found above 1,800-2,100 m (e.g. the Ngorongoro Crater). Common Wildebeest are pure grazers, requiring water at least every day or two in the dry season (Estes 2013).","Once often found in large concentrations, the numbers and distribution of Common Wildebeest have been reduced by the spread of settlement and livestock, elimination of water sources through watershed deforestation and expropriation for irrigation, poaching for meat, the loss of the seasonal ranges of some migratory populations, and  game eradication programs in failed efforts to eliminate the wild hosts of sleeping sickness (nagana) and other diseases of domestic livestock (East 1999, Estes 2013). Fences that blocked migration between wet and dry-season ranges have caused mass die-off events, by denying access to water and to higher-rainfall refuges during severe droughts. A notorious example is the decline in numbers and episodes of mass mortality of Botswana wildebeest caused by veterinary cordon fences that blocked drought-induced migrations, particularly after thousands died at Lake Xau in the north-east of the Kalahari Desert in 1980 (Owens and Owens 1980).","During the late 1990s, estimates were available for all of the major surviving populations of this species, mainly from aerial surveys, producing a total population in excess of 1,200,000 (correcting for undercounting bias in aerial surveys). The migratory Serengeti-Mara population represented about 70% of global species numbers (942,000, having dropped below one million following the severe 1993 drought). Other population estimates were: Blue Wildebeest, 150,000 (with about half in protected areas, and one-quarter on private land and conservancies); Cookson’s Wildebeest, 16,000 (about 60% in protected areas); Nyassa Wildebeest, 96,000 (about two-thirds in protected areas, particularly Selous); and Eastern White-bearded Wildebeest, 94,000 (with about two-thirds in and around protected areas) (East 1999). <br/><br/>The most recent estimate of the total population size of Common Wildebeest is around 1,550,000 (Estes and East 2009), largely due to the rebounding of the Serengeti population to about 1,300,000 (Thirgood <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004); other subspecies populations are estimated at 130,000 Blue Wildebeest, 5,000-10,000 Cookson’s, and 50,000-75,000 Nyassa. However, estimates of Eastern White-bearded Wildebeest indicate a steep decline in the subspecies’ populations to a current level of perhaps 6,000-8,000 animals.<br/><br/>Citing various authors, East (1999) indicates that population densities estimated by aerial surveys range from less than 0.15/km² in areas such as Kafue, Etosha, Hwange and the central and southern Kalahari, to 0.6-1.3/km² in areas such as Kruger, North Luangwa, Selous and Kajiado, and 3.6/km² in Tarangire. Recent total counts in areas where the species is abundant have produced population density estimates as high as 34.0-35.0/km², e.g., Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater.",Stable,"The Common Wildebeest (<em>Connochaetes taurinus</em>) is formerly distributed from southern Kenya southwards to northern and eastern Namibia, Botswana, the Orange River in South Africa, and Mozambique (East 1999, 2013). This species have also been introduced to regions outside their former distribution range, such as the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe and private farmland in Namibia (East 1999).<br/><br/>The ranges of the five subspecies are as follows (following East 1999, 2013):<br/><br/><em>C. t. taurinus</em> (Blue Wildebeest). Namibia and South Africa to Mozambique north of the Orange River, and from Mozambique to Zambia south of the Zambezi River, and from south-west Zambia to south-east and southern Angola.<br/> <em>C. t. cooksoni</em> (Cookson’s Wildebeest).

Northern Tanzania and southern Kenya west of the Gregory Rift Valley, reaching Lake Victoria at Speke Bay.",The Common Wildebeest is hunted for food and sport.,Terrestrial,"The vulnerability of this species to illegal hunting and loss of habitat caused by the encroachment of settlement is increased by the dependence of some migratory populations on seasonal access to unprotected rangelands. In these cases (e.g., Liuwa Plain, Tarangire and Kajiado) effective protection and management of national parks which contain only part of the population’s annual range may be insufficient to prevent major population declines. Loss of range outside protected areas may result in the replacement of migratory populations with much smaller (but nevertheless substantial) resident populations within protected areas, as has occurred in areas such as Etosha National Park and Central Kgalagadi Game Reserve. Some wildebeest populations are naturally relatively sedentary and/or their seasonal movements are generally accommodated within protected areas (e.g., Kafue, Luangwa, Hwange and Selous). The overall status of the species may not change in the long term if it continues to be well represented in protected areas and on private land, but if current trends continue its populations will become increasingly sedentary within fenced parks, reserves and farms (East 1999).<br/><br/>The future of the enormous migratory wildebeest population of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem will have a major impact on the species’ overall conservation status. This population has shown signs of recovery from its decline in the early 1990s (Thirgood <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), but two sections of the migration route – the Ikoma Open Area and the Mara Group Ranches – currently receive limited protection and are threatened by poaching or agriculture. Other smaller, but substantial populations, of Common Wildebeest occur in areas such as: Kafue and Liuwa Plain (Zambia), Etosha (Namibia), Okavango, Makgadikgadi-Nxai Pan, Ngamiland and the central and southern Kalahari (Botswana), Hwange (Zimbabwe), Kruger, Hluhluwe-Umfolozi and Mkuzi (South Africa), Hlane (Swaziland) and private farmland (Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa) (Blue Wildebeest); the Luangwa Valley (Zambia) (Cookson’s Wildebeest); the Selous ecosystem (Tanzania) (Nyassa Wildebeest); Ngorongoro Crater (Tanzania) (Western White-bearded Wildebeest); and Tarangire (Tanzania) and Kajiado (Kenya) (Eastern White-bearded Wildebeest).

Both this decrease in suitable habitat and increase in human-otter conflict are currently occurring and will certainly increase over the next three generations.<br/> <br/> This reassessment is based on a perceived (in regions where studies have been conducted) (Akpona <em>et al</em>. 2011, Akpona <em>et al. </em>2015, Dognimon <em>et al. </em>2019, Reed-Smith in prep.) and assumed (in regions where no studies have been done) population decline over the last 16 years and beyond. In much of their range, populations of Spotted-necked Otters are faced with habitat loss or degradation, polluted waters, and/or degraded aquatic ecosystems due to the introduction of exotic species such as Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes</em>) and Nile Perch (<em>Lates niloticus</em>) and marginal agricultural practices. This habitat disturbance is exacerbated by poor sanitation infrastructure and growing industrial pollution. Additionally, the regional human populations are poverty-stricken, thereby, increasing pressure on all natural resources including water, vegetation, otters’ prey base, as well as reducing suitable resting and denning sites vital to the survival of the species.<br/> <br/> For all the above reasons and the lack of effective conservation measures, currently a continued decline in the overall Spotted-necked Otter population of at least 20% is suspected for the next three&#160;generations (23 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Therefore, the species is listed as Near Threatened as it almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A3cde; this is a precautionary listing.<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""></span>","<p>The Spotted-necked Otter inhabits freshwater habitats where water is  unsilted, unpolluted, and rich in small to medium sized fishes  (Reed-Smith 2010, d'Inzillo Carranza and Rowe-Rowe 2013). The species is  comparatively common in Central and East Africa, where suitable habitat  constitutes of large lakes and open waters, such as the Okavango Delta  (Rowe-Rowe and Somers 1998). Elsewhere, it is found in streams, rivers  and impoundments up to altitudes of 2,500m (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996).  Wherever it occurs, the spotted-necked otter prefers shallow to deep  waters (Larivière 2002). In a telemetry study conducted in Kwa-Zulu  Natal, South Africa, the core areas of habitat included highland river  and tributaries, natural oxbow lakes and some man-made lakes  artificially stocked with alien trout (Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2000). Human  presence negatively influences spotted-necked otter, but human presence  alone cannot explain the absence of spotted-necked otters in an area,  because other habitat features such as presence or absence of vegetation  cover along the banks also determine the occurrence of otters (Dognimon  <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Benin, West Africa the Spotted-necked Otter is  frequently observed in the <em>Ouémé </em>valley especially along the River Hlan,  possibly due to the abundance of fish (Akpona, 2004). In riparian and  lacustrine habitats adequate vegetation in the form of long grass,  reeds, dense bushes, overhanging trees and large boulder piles are  essential to provide cover during periods of inactivity and for denning.  Unlike African Clawless Otter, they do not occur in marine or estuarine  waters (Angelici <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Predominantly a piscivore,  the Spotted-necked Otter, also occasionally feeds on crabs, frogs,  insects and birds. In L. Muhazi (Rwanda) and L. Victoria (Tanzania) diet  consists almost entirely of fish of the genus <em>Haplochromis</em>, followed by  fish of the genus <em>Tilapia </em>(Procter 1963, Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990,  Lejeune 1990). Kingdon (1977) in L. Bunyoni (Uganda/Rwanda) reported  that the main prey before the introduction of <em>Tilapia </em>spp. was the Clawed Toad (<em>Xenopus laevis</em>), and the otter population at that time was  thriving. In South Africa, where fish faunas of inland rivers are poor,  the species appears to forage on almost equal amounts of fish, crabs and  frogs, supplemented by small amounts of dragonfly (Odonata) larvae  (Rowe-Rowe 1977a, Somers and Purves 1996, Perrin and Carugati 2000). In  South Africa, the fish was consumed more during autumn and winter while  crabs were consumed more during spring and summer (Rowe-Rowe 1977a,  Perrin and Carugati 2000). This could be related to the effects of  water temperature on the prey: during the cold season crabs retreat into  inaccessible places and at the same time the efficiency of locomotion  of fishes is reduced by cold water (Rowe-Rowe 1977a). In all studies to  date, Spotted-necked Otters fed mainly on small fish, 80–90% being  smaller than 100–150 mm fork length (Rowe-Rowe and Somers 1998). When  preying on crabs, specimens with a carapace width &lt;45 mm appear to be  selected (Rowe-Rowe and Somers 1998) and Rowe-Rowe (1977) found that  most crabs with a carapace width &gt;50 mm were avoided. Somers and  Purves (1996) in the Bushman R. also found fish of the genus <em>Tilapia </em>to  be the main component of its diet, and they did not find remains of any  other species of fish. Rowe-Rowe (1977) and Perrin and Carranza (2000)  suggested that they hunt mainly by sight. However, in the lakes where  both small fishes and Spotted-necked Otters are most abundant, the water  is very turbid (Lejeune and Frank 1990, H. Kruuk pers. comm.),  suggesting that senses additional to sight are used. Foraging occurs  mainly within 2–10 m of the shore (Procter 1963, Lejeune 1989, Kruuk and  Goudswaard 1990, Reed-Smith <em>et al.</em> 2014). Foraging dives  generally have a duration of 16–25 sec in deep water (Lejeune 1989) and  shorter (5–20 sec) in shallower water (Rowe-Rowe 1977). Surfacing  periods between unsuccessful dives are brief (6–10 sec) as are those  when small fish are caught and eaten in the water (11–16 sec) (Lejeune  1989). Larger prey is taken to the shore and eaten out of the water  (Procter 1963, Rowe-Rowe 1977). Prey appears to be always captured in  the mouth. Very small fish (&lt;60 mm) are eaten from the head, but all  larger fish and frogs are eaten tail first, with the heads sometimes  being discarded (Rowe-Rowe 1977, Power and Slater-Jones 2010). Foraging  is mostly solitary, except in lakes where the otters fish in large  groups (Procter 1963, Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990, Reed-Smith <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>","The Spotted-necked Otter is decreasing throughout its range, mainly as a result of the alteration or degradation of freshwater habitats and riparian vegetation. This rapid habitat loss is exacerbated by a growing, poor population engaged in unsustainable agricultural activity (Rowe-Rowe 1990, 1992, 1995;&#160;Kipkemboi<em> et al.</em> 2007) and unsustainable fishing practices (LVFO 2008, Yan 2017). These practices have led to bank and shoreline erosion, denuding the rivers of important vegetative cover used by the otters, increased human presence which is disruptive to otter denning, increased use of smaller mesh nets and poisoning to improve catches, and the change or depletion of the otters’ prey base (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990). Pollution of waters with agricultural, livestock, and societal wastes also are threatening with evidence of the bioaccumulation of organochlorines and other biocontaminants recorded in Spotted-necked Otters (Mason and Rowe-Rowe 1992). The rate of otters becoming entangled in set and discarded fishing nets is impossible to determine. However, based on known entanglement of other species it has likely increased over the occasional drowning reported previously (Stuart 1985, Rowe-Rowe 1990).<br/> <br/> Otters are also killed for food or skins, as a perceived threat to poultry, or as a competitor for fish (Rowe-Rowe 1990, Akpona <em>et al.</em> 2011, Reed-Smith <em>et al. </em>2010,&#160;Mgomo and Reed-Smith 2020). Introduction of alien fish species that out-compete the smaller indigenous fish was identified as a main threat for the Lake Victoria population (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990).&#160;Increased commercial use of Africa’s fish resource as well as increasing dependence on fish as a source of protein for local populations is leading to an increase in conflicts between otters and fishermen (Akpona <em>et al.</em> 2015, Abdallah 2017, Ergete <em>et al.</em> 2018, Mgomo and Reed-Smith 2020.&#160;The Spotted-necked Otter is the most expensive species of small carnivore species sold in the animal-based medicine market in Benin (Djagoun and Gaubert 2009). Ammouso 2003 record that the hunting pressure on H. maculicollis for food and ritual practices is increasing because their capture does not require expensive investment in equipment. <br/> <br/> Habitat loss and increased conflict with people is impacting all populations. The increase in human numbers dependent on fish as a source of protein is particularly threatening in the large East African lakes which are historically important refugia for this species. It has been reported that the introduction of Nile Perch (Lates niloticus) into Lake Victoria and their impact on the diversity of the fish biomass in the lake is forcing a dietary shift for the otters (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990). This shift in prey base has been observed (Reed-Smith 2010) but its full impact is unknown at this time particularly for areas outside of the protected national park where recent studies have occurred. The introduction of invasive alien species such as water hyacinth (Eichhornia&#160;crassipes) is also degrading the water ecosystem.<br/> <br/> The impact of global climate change throughout Africa (Magadza 1994, Dixon <em>et al. </em>2003, Hendrix and Glaser 2007,&#160;Cianfrani <em>et al.</em> 2018) also has the potential of decreasing suitable habitat for otters and increasing human/otter conflict for increasingly scarce resources such as water, land, and fish. UNECA projected in a 1999 study that portions of the Spotted-necked Otter’s current range would be experiencing fresh water stress and scarcity by 2025 with much of the rest of its range considered vulnerable to these hydrologic issues.","Like other otter species, abundance and density of Spotted-necked Otter appear to be dependent, in part, on the availability of fish; consequently, this species historically was common or fairly common in the fish-rich Central African lakes, but generally uncommon or rare in the rest of Africa where fish fauna tends to be poor (Rowe-Rowe 1990, 1995; d'Inzillo Carranza and Rowe-Rowe 2013). In an area that included a highland stream and man-made lakes in South Africa, Perrin <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated one otter/1–2 km of stream, while in less suitable habitat Rowe-Rowe (1992) estimated one otter/6–11 km. In a more recent study (Kubheka <em>et al</em>. 2013) detected only 25% of the number of spraints located during two previous studies in an area of intense human disturbance but roughly the same number of spraints located in an undisturbed area during the latter 1993 study indicating a reduction in otter numbers in areas of increased human presence. In the Central and East African lakes, density was estimated at between one and two otters per kilometre of shoreline (Procter 1963, Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990, Lejeune and Frank 1990 cited in D’Inzilla-Carranza and Rowe-Rowe 2013). A more recent study (2006 – 2011) of Lake Victoria detected what could be a similar abundance on portions of the protected shoreline of Rubondo Island National Park, but local sources reported a perceived decline in, or absence of otters along other portions of the lake’s shorelines.<br/> <br/> Their abundance also appears to be dependent on suitable habitat (Reed-Smith 2010) which includes dense vegetative cover (Dognimon <em>et al.</em> 2019) and/or the presence of large, piled boulder shorelines. Early studies of this species inhabiting large East African lakes and South African riverine systems reported observations of group size ranging up to approximately 20 individuals (Rowe-Rowe and Somers 1998, Reed-Smith unpublished data). Recent studies in East Africa (Reed-Smith <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. in preparation, and unpublished data for Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda) indicate population declines due to habitat loss, water course changes due to drought, increased human populations, and increased eradication of otters as perceived competitors as well as for consumption and traditional medicine. Based on informant interviews in East Africa (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2010 and unpublished data) as well as reports from other range countries, this species is seldom observed or not seen as often as it was 10 years ago and groups of more than five are rarely seen. Over the last six years, in areas of Lake Victoria where otters were routinely observed, informants now report rarely or never seeing them. From West Africa, recent studies have reported the presence of the Spotted-necked Otter to the south of Benin (Dognimon <em>et al</em>. 2019) based on field observation. Overfishing and destruction of the wetland habitat for agriculture are the main reasons of the declining population trend according to the local perception.&#160; Although the species has been previously reported form the Northern Cape Province from the Vaal River (Stuart 1981, Skinner and Chimimba, 2005), Power and Slater-Jones (2010) reported a&#160; range extension up to the Orange River, 1200 km downstream of the existing range, though they have mentioned that intensive surveys are required to determine their extensive occurrence in the Orange River.<br/><br/> Unfortunately, beyond these personal accounts, there is a lack of data availability on the status and ecology of this species throughout most of their historic range for the last fifteen years and only marginally more for the last 30 years. An additional problem in assessing their status is that throughout most of their range there is often no distinction made by local people between <em>H. maculicollis</em> and <em>Aonyx capensis</em> or <em>A. congicus</em> which are sympatric species in some parts of their range countries.",Decreasing,"Spotted-necked Otters are found in lakes and larger rivers throughout much of Africa south of 10°N latitude. They are common in Lake Victoria and across Zambia, but for some unexplained reason often are absent from what appear to be suitable habitats, such as the lakes and rivers, of East Africa and the Zambezi below Victoria Falls (Estes 1992). It is likely to be present throughout most of its historic range albeit, in reduced numbers due to habitat degradation, civil strife, polluted waterways, increasing human animosity towards this species, and use as a meat source (Reed-Smith 2010).<br/> <br/> However, due to the paucity of current information, their continued presence in Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Sudan is presumed. The species is believed to be extinct in Burundi, Ghana, Lesotho, and Togo (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Current reports indicate the Spotted-necked Otter is present in reduced numbers in Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2014, Akpona <em>et al.</em> 2015). The large lakes of Central and East Africa and possibly the larger river systems are important sites for the conservation of this species.","The species is hunted for food, medicinal purposes, and pelt&#160;(De Luca <em>et al.</em> 2018, Reed-Smith <em>et al.</em> 2010, Mgomo and Reed-Smith 2020).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Currently there are only a few regionally based conservation actions in place for this species (e.g African Otter&#160;Network and IUCN SSC-Otter Specialist Group projects, listed as Vulnerable in South Africa) and it is technically protected in all national parks. The species has also been listed as Vulnerable in the Benin Red List (Neuenschwander <em>et al.</em> 2011), informing about urgent conservation actions required on the species. <br/> <br/> They are present in several protected areas across their range but are little known and seldom seen by staff or visitors. Efforts should be made to educate range country park staff about all otter species and the role they play in a healthy ecosystem to increase awareness and protection for this species. This lack of knowledge by range country professionals can be mitigated by initiating an awareness campaign for all range country wildlife professionals. This campaign should be expanded to target human populations sharing their ecosystems with otters, particularly where traditional tales about otter behaviour are deleterious to the species future survival (e.g. otters rape women or raid young maize crops).<br/> <br/> Another significant conservation action is taking steps to create a network with field biologists working in ecosystems where otters are found. The creation of a user-friendly system to report otter sightings would significantly contribute to our knowledge of their current distribution and aid researchers in future assessments of status and population trends in Africa where they inhabit areas that are hard to reach, or dangerous to survey due to the presence of crocodiles, hippopotamus, etc. Networking with other researchers to create synergy between conservation efforts also would benefit preservation of important otter habitats and ecosystems.<br/> <br/> There is need for detailed studies on the distribution and current status of this species as well as conducting public relations campaigns to increase awareness of the presence of otters in Africa.<br/> <br/> It is listed in CITES Appendix II.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Since the total occupied area in India has been variously estimated at between 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chauhan 2006) and 400,000 km² (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), or even more (Puri <em>et al</em>. 2015), it is impossible to gauge population trend from changes in occupied area. However, there is, throughout most of the range, a clear trend in deterioration of habitat, which has caused Sloth Bear populations to decline (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008). This deterioration in habitat is expected to accelerate in the future.<br/> <br/> Habitat outside of protected areas is under severe and growing pressure due to demands for natural resources and the ever increasing populations of both humans and livestock in the region (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006a). This problem is compounded by many factors including that in India, where the vast majority of Sloth Bear habitat is located: 1) the per capita forest area is only one-tenth of the world’s average; 2) there is a demand–supply gap for construction timber leading to over-harvesting and degradation of natural ecosystems; 3) an estimated 78% of forests are subjected to heavy grazing causing degradation of forest habitat; and 4) vast stretches of forest are still diverted for a variety of developmental and infrastructural projects (Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India 2009). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2015) reported that India had a 0.3% rate increase of forest area during 2010-2015, due to afforestation. However, the type and location of all the forest planted is unspecified. Much of this afforestation effort is occurring in more urban areas and it is not known how much is accessible to Sloth Bears.<br/> <br/> The human population growth in India is presently the greatest threat to Sloth Bears. It drives the loss and degradation of habitat and is likely the cause for growing human-bear conflicts in the country. The population of India is expected to increase by 366,000,000 people (roughly 30%) over the next 30 years&#160; (US Census bureau, International database <a href=""http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php"">http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php</a>). This extraordinary population growth is likely to have major direct and indirect impacts on Sloth Bear populations, especially those existing outside protected areas. The human population growth of India is particularly alarming because 90-95%of the range of Sloth Bears is in India. Likewise, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> (2007) predicted a future decline in Sloth Bear numbers in Sri Lanka due to burgeoning human densities and commensurate habitat deterioration and increasing conflicts.<br/> <br/> The recent extirpation of Sloth Bears in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013) highlights serious concerns over persistence of small, isolated Sloth Bear populations, especially outside of protected areas, where half or more of the populations exist. Sloth Bears are particularly vulnerable to loss of habitat because of their reliance on lowland areas, which tend to be the places most readily used and developed by people. Moreover, the aggressiveness of this species makes them incompatible with high human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Given the lack of effective measures to control the rate of habitat loss and exploitation, Sloth Bear populations are expected to continue declining, at an increasing rate, resulting in a &gt;30% loss over the next 30 years (three generations).</p>","<p>Sloth Bears subsist primarily on termites, ants, and fruits. Sloth Bears are the only species of bear adapted specifically for myrmecophagy (ant and termite-eating; Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). Like other myrmecphagous mammals, they have especially small home ranges compared to other ursids (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006b). The ratio of insects to fruits in the diet varies with the seasonal and geographical availability of each food (Baskaran <em>et al.</em> 1997, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1997, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Mewada and Dharaiya 2010, Sukhadiya <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fruits may comprise 70‒90% of the diet during the fruiting season, whereas termites and other insects may comprise &gt;80% of the diet the rest of the year (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears occupy a wide range of habitats on the Indian mainland including wet and dry tropical forests, savannahs, scrublands, and grasslands (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ramesh <em>et al.</em> 2012). They are primarily a lowland species. Most Sloth Bear range in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is limited to habitats below 1500 m, although the species may occur as high as 2,000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats (Johnsingh 2003, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Sri Lanka, Sloth Bears are confined to the remaining dry forests in the north and eastern parts of the island, mostly below 300 m (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006). In areas where forest cover is sparse but daytime temperatures are high (a large part of the range), the bear is principally nocturnal or crepuscular and shelters in rock outcrops, thickets, and tree cavities during the heat of the day. Although some Sloth Bears may be active during the day in protected areas (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999), they tend to be almost exclusively nocturnal in disturbed and fragmented forests interspersed with human habitations (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004; Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2012).<br/> <br/> Studies in Nepal and Sri Lanka suggest that Sloth Bears avoid areas where human disturbance is high, so crop depredation by Sloth Bears is uncommon (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). However, in some parts of India, Sloth Bears routinely raid peanut, maize, and fruit crops (Chhangani 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160; In some of these areas the habitats are severely degraded and affected by human exploitation, including the extraction of several food sources of the Sloth Bear.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears typically breed May through July, and females give birth, usually to one or two cubs, from November to January (Laurie and Seidensticker 1977, Iswariah 1984, Gopal 1991, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999, Chauhan <em>et al.</em> 2003, Spady <em>et al.</em> 2007). Cubs often ride on the mother's back during their first nine months, presumably to reduce the risk of predation. Cubs remain with their mothers for 1.5-2.5 years resulting in a 2 or 3 year interbirth interval (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999).</p>","<p>Major threats to this species are habitat loss or degradation (often related to human population growth), retaliation from human‒bear conflicts, and (to a lesser degree) poaching (Johnsingh 2003, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bargali <em>et al. </em>2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (e.g. teak, eucalyptus), over-grazing, extraction of minerals, quarrying, settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990).<br/> <br/> In some parts of the range, encounters between people and Sloth Bears have led to numerous serious human injuries and many deaths (Rajpurohit and Krausman 2000, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Such incidents occur where people frequently use bear habitat, and where the habitat has become severely degraded, prompting bears to seek food and water in closer proximity to humans. Most attacks occur when people and bears surprised each other in thickets or around rock outcrops, where visibility is obstructed: the bear(s)—sometimes multiple adult bears are involved—rush at, pursue, and knock down the person, and often attack the face. Bears that attack or threaten to attack people may ultimately be killed. Sloth Bear attacks outside protected areas are increasing, and hostility of local people towards bears has made bear conservation more difficult (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Mardaraj 2014). Increasing numbers of Sloth Bear attacks appear to be related to rising human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> The only natural (non-human) threats to Sloth Bears are Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and possibly Leopards (<em>P. pardus</em>). The threat of Tiger predation may account for the aggressive nature of Sloth Bears (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999). Sloth Bears have been observed fending off Tigers, but they are also occasionally killed by Tigers (Gopal 1991).</p>","<p>Information is available on the area of potentially occupied range in India (Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar<em> et al. </em>2012), Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a), and Sri Lanka (Ratnayeke <em>et al</em>. 2007a,b). The potential Sloth Bear distribution in India was estimated to be <em>ca.</em> 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al. </em>2004, Chauhan 2006) but the more recent National Bear Conservation and Welfare Action Plan 2012 (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the occupied range is twice that large (400,000 km²). An even more recent survey suggested that Sloth Bears may occupy 52% of the land area of India (Puri <em>et al.</em> 2015). Notably, though, the latter study was based on very large sampling cells (2,800 km² across a sampling region of nearly 3 million km²), and any cell estimated to be occupied would have been considered as fully occupied; this would inflate the range area considerably. In short, the results of this study do not appear to reflect the reality of Sloth Bear distribution in India as they clearly do not occur in &gt;50% of the land area. Additionally, the model predicts Sloth Bear occurrence in specific places where they are known to be absent, such as Gir Forest. However, the study does demonstrate that Sloth Bears can live in relatively small degraded areas.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears can occur at high densities. However, there are few reliable Sloth Bear density estimates: most estimates have been based on opinions gleaned from interviews and questionnaires (e.g., Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006). The one robust density estimate for this species, which was based on mark–resight of radio-collared bears, yielded an estimate of 27 bears/100 km² for Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and as high as 72 bears/100 km² in a core area of the park (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). Gopalaswamy (2006) attempted a rigorous estimate based on presence-absence records at camera traps (as per Royle and Nichols 2003), but detection rates were too low to produce a useful estimate.<br/> <br/> Attempts have been made to apply estimated densities in various protected areas to all occupied areas to obtain a range-wide population estimate. Depending on methods and data employed in this process, range-wide estimates have varied from &lt;10,000 to &gt;20,000 bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). None of these estimates are considered reliable enough to track changes in population size, especially since the total range area is not well defined. Estimates for individual Indian states are also not reliable enough to track population trends (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The population of Sloth Bears on the island of Sri Lanka is equally not well understood. Santiapillai and Santiapillai (1990) tentatively reported a population of 300–600 bears for the island. Ratneyeke <em>et al.</em> (2007a) estimated, based on home ranges of radio-collared bears that Wasgomuwa National Park alone may support more than 100-150 sloth bears. This national park only makes up roughly 5% of the known Sloth Bear range in Sri Lanka and therefore the population likely well exceeds the previous estimate.<br/> <br/> Increased habitat fragmentation and a decrease of occupied habitat have been observed in many parts of the Sloth Bear range (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008, Bargali 2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). However, rigorous assessments of population change are rare. Jhala <em>et al.</em> (2011) compared occupancy of Sloth Bears in select areas from 2006 to 2010, during a comprehensive Tiger survey across India, and reported five decreasing, four increasing, and three stable bear populations; although the methods and short time span between surveys probably precluded a reliable indication of population trend.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sloth Bear’s historical distribution includes a large portion of India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, as well as the southern lowlands of Nepal and presumably Bhutan. Some unverified reports suggested that they once occurred in the western-most corner of present day Myanmar (Erdbrink 1953), but this was never confirmed and seems unlikely based on the mountainous habitat. Historically this species overlapped the distributions of Asiatic Black Bears (<span class=""sciname""><em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) in northern India (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2012), and with both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears (<em>Helarctos malayanus</em>) in northeastern India (Choudhury 2011).&#160;Historical records are confusing, though, because Sloth Bears and Asiatic Black Bears look alike and were often not reliably distinguished.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>India</u></strong><br/> At least 90% of the present Sloth Bear range occurs in India. Within India their distribution is constrained to the south by the ocean, to the northwest by deserts, and to the north and east by mountains. Although Sloth Bears were once common and even abundant throughout the Indian Peninsula (McTaggart Cowan 1972, Krishnan 1972, Brander 1982), their range has shrunk and densities reduced due to continuous habitat loss and human-caused mortalities. Although still found scattered across much of its former range, their actual distribution is now highly fragmented and confined mainly to five distinct regions, namely northern, northeastern, central, southeastern, and southwestern (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a, Johnsingh 2003, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The northern distribution region occurs largely within the state of Uttarakhand (Bargali 2012), but also includes the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and the northwestern tip of Bihar. This northern region borders the southern and western areas of Nepal and includes trans-border populations. However, the northern region remains completely isolated from the other population regions in India due to large scale forest removal and agriculture and human settlements.<br/> <br/> The northeastern region is the farthest east that this species occurs and is perhaps the least understood region in terms of Sloth Bear distribution. The bulk of the distribution appears to occur in the state of Assam (Choudhury 2011, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), though Sloth Bears are also known from Manipur, Megalaya and Arunachal Pradesh (where it is very rare). The fact that the distribution of Sloth Bears in this region overlaps with that of both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears has made reports of Sloth Bear occurrence less reliable.<br/> <br/> The central region is the largest region. The bulk of the distribution occurs in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, but includes the states of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Just south of this region, in the southern half of Andhra Pradesh, is the southeastern region, which occurs along the Eastern Ghats. It is not known whether bears move between the central and southeastern regions.<br/> <br/> The southwestern area follows the Western Ghats and principally falls within the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where there may be a connection to the southeastern region. They have been observed up to 2,000 m elevation in the Western Ghats (A.J.T. Johnsingh, personal communication, in Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a). They also stretch northwestward into Gujarat and Rajasthan.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Nepal</u></strong><br/> In Nepal, Sloth Bears are most common within the narrow strip of lowland grassland–forest mosaic called the Terai. They also range into the lower Siwaliks (maximum elevation is unknown). The bears are mainly in protected areas in the central and western portions of the Terai. Since the mid-1980s, they were thought to have been extirpated from the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve in western Nepal, an area containing the largest patch of continuous grassland in Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). However, during a 2013 Tiger camera trap study in the reserve a photo of a Sloth Bear was captured. Then in 2014 Sloth Bear tracks and scat were recorded in the reserve as well (Babu Ram Lamichane, National Trust for Nature Conservation—Suklaphanta Conservation Program, pers. comm., 2015). Therefore, it appears that Sloth Bears have recolonized Sulka Phanta Wildlife Reserve, likely from adjacent Piliphit Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh, India, which is known to have Sloth Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012); alternately, Sloth Bears persisted in such small numbers that they went undetected for several years (Johnsingh 2003). Some of the Sloth Bear populations in Nepal remain connected with the Indian northern region (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bangladesh</u><br/> </strong>Sloth Bears have been extirpated from Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013). The last documented records are from the mid-1990s (NCSIP-1 2001, Sarker 2006). Although they had been present in the southeastern, eastern and northeastern parts of the country, the forest patches in which they persisted have been largely removed (Sarker 2006).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bhutan</u></strong><br/> Recent investigations suggest that if Sloth Bears occupy Bhutan, they are very rare. Garshelis <em>et al.</em> (1999a) mapped two populations of Sloth Bears in Bhutan, including Royal Manas National Park (RMNP) and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Their range map was based on habitat-elevation information and purported documentation of presence.&#160; However, due to frequent confusion in distinguishing Sloth Bears from Asiatic Black Bears, it is now apparent that this range map was wrong. Sloth Bears appear to have a much narrower range in Bhutan, if at all. One camera trap photo in RMNP, taken in 2009, 2 km from the Indian border, is the only current verified record of presence (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Grasslands, which are preferred habitat for Sloth Bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999 a,b; Choudhury 2011) are present in both RMNP and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and both of these protected areas are connected to protected areas in India, known to contain sloth bears. However, it is not known whether a true trans-boundary population exists anywhere along this border, or if just a few vagrant bears occasionally come across to the Bhutan side (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Sri Lanka</u></strong><br/> The Sri Lankan Sloth Bear subspecies is distributed in the north and east sides of the island and is closely tied with forest cover (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). Sloth Bears occupy roughly 17% of the island and there is still a high connectivity between occupied areas. However, recent civil war activities largely occurred in the northern and eastern sides of the island, which are home to the largest contiguous forest patches and which historically supported healthy Sloth Bear populations. These areas have gone largely unprotected and it is still unknown how sloth bear distribution may have been affected (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007a).</p>","<p>Poaching of Sloth Bears for trade in parts has been reported (Servheen 1990, Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), but its current extent and impact on bear populations is uncertain. Compared to other Asian bear species, commercial trade in Sloth Bear parts appears to be relatively low (Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014). Poaching also occurs for local use: male reproductive organs used as aphrodisiac; bones, teeth and claws used to ward off evil spirits; bear fat used for native medicine and hair regeneration (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997, Chauhan 2006). Occasional rashes of poaching incidents have been reported. For example, in Madhya Pradesh in 2014, at least eight male bears were found professionally poached, as indicated by the skilful removal of their reproductive organs, gall bladders and claws (Basu 2014, Naveen 2014). Two of the dead bears were found near the buffer area of Khana Tiger Reserve, while the others were found in less protected forests in the state. The manner in which the bear parts were removed led many to speculate that that the poaching may be taking place on a larger scale and that the parts may have been removed for illegal international trade.<br/> <br/> The capture of cubs, which often includes the killing of the mother bear, for use as street-show ""dancing bears"" (Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997) used to be a threat in some parts of India, but has been controlled to a significant level (D’Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2011). This practice has been illegal in India since 1972, though it continued in earnest until 2009. However it persists to a small degree in southern Nepal. It is unclear if the practitioners were always in Nepal or if they crossed the border to Nepal from India due to the political pressure to end the practice in India. Several dancing bears have been confiscated at the Nepal-India border while they were being brought into India (K. Satyanarayan, Wildlife SOS, personal communication, 2015). Additionally, a cub was rescued that was being smuggled into Nepal with clear signs that it was to be sold for use as a dancing bear (Wildlife SOS 2015).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Sloth Bears are listed in Appendix I of CITES and are completely protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. They are also protected to varying degrees by national laws in the other range countries. However, they can be killed to protect life or property.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears are reported to exist in 174 Protected Areas (PAs) in India, which include 46 National Parks and 128 Wildlife Sanctuaries (Chauhan 2006). Populations appear to be reasonably well protected when inside these PAs, but face deteriorating habitat conditions outside (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dharaiya, 2009). Reduced cover and food resources outside PAs (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004) have led to increased human–bear conflicts, including frequent maulings (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is estimated that half to two-thirds of the Sloth Bears in India live outside PAs. Roughly half the occupied range in Sri Lanka occurs outside PAs (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b).<br/> <br/> Human-bear conflicts, both crop raiding and bear attacks, are a growing concern for this species. Given the aggressive nature of this animal, and the increasing number of encounters between bears and people, these bears are widely feared. Although education may help reduce human-bear conflicts and enhance a conservation ethic among locals, the root of the problem is largely related to the expansion of human settlement and deteriorating habitat, which increases the chance of interaction between people and bears. Thus, habitat improvements (government or community-based reforestation) would be helpful in alleviating such conflicts. Potential solutions to this problem have not been studied in depth and further research on this issue is critical to getting this problem under control. The planting of fruit trees, to provide both food and cover, has been undertaken in several states in India.<br/> <br/> Other projects to help ameliorate human-bear conflicts will probably need to be implemented for a number of years to produce useful outcomes; long-term funding will thus be needed to advance the science of human-bear conflict resolution. Where sufficient human resources and funding exist, conflict rapid-response teams (staffed by NGOs, government personnel, and local people) can be effective. Safety guidelines can be devised and disseminated, based on knowledge of bear behaviour and ecology, to help people avoid bears or minimize chances of being attacked. Better methods to deter bears are also needed. Additionally, educational efforts to increase awareness and promote greater tolerance are likely to be keys to success.<br/> <br/> Aside from the global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species, published by the IUCN in 1999 (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), India developed a National Conservation Action Plan for bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). This action plan was developed through a wide range of consultations with stakeholders and covers all four species present in India. The plan emphasizes mitigation of human-bear conflicts, increased habitat management, enhanced research and information gathering, capacity building, and improved communication and education. Priority actions in the action plan include: strengthening methods of crop and livestock protection; reducing bear-caused human injuries, creating rapid response teams to investigate conflicts with bears (and possible claims for monetary compensation); enhancing human tolerance toward bears; identifying critical habitats and corridors used by bears, especially those outside PAs; increasing habitat protection and restoring degraded habitats outside PAs; reducing dependency of local communities on resources needed by bears; discouraging shifting agriculture; developing methods to track population size and trends; involving communities in bear monitoring programs; equipping forest and wildlife staff with adequate knowledge and modern equipment to manage all types of human-bear interactions; and developing an advocacy program for bear conservation through active communication to the public and pressure on corporations and politicians.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
166520460,7951,Equus hemionus,Near Threatened,,2020,2015-05-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is assessed as Near Threatened (NT) because a population decline of at least 20% is projected over the next three generations, based on old prevailing and newly emerging risks, thus approaching Vulnerable (VU) under A3bcd. <br/><br/>Although the global population is large and currently appears stable, the rapid infrastructure development and the associated influx of people in large parts of the species range could quickly result in the re-emergence of old threats (e.g. increased competition with livestock for water and pasture, high poaching levels). Furthermore, linear infrastructure (e.g. roads, railways, canals) - if not carefully designed and mitigated - are likely to result in high mortalities if Wild Asses are impeded in their long-distance movements and become cut-off from important resources or refuge areas. Mongolia, which currently houses over 75% of the global population, is at a crossroad and the outcome will depend on Mongolia’s ability to become “a global model for demonstrating that major economic development projects can proceed without degrading ungulate migrations” (Batsaikhan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Though global dynamics are primarily driven by the large Mongolian population, locally there are both increasing and decreasing trends with some populations in Turkmenistan, Iran, Kazakhstan and China being threatened with immediate extinction. Furthermore, several population estimates are rather old and methods are rarely standardized. Consequentially, the different subspecies have also been assessed individually.","Asiatic Wild Asses inhabit mountain steppe, steppe, semi-desert and desert plains, but nowadays have become mainly confined to the low productivity semi-desert and desert plains (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a). Wild Asses can be found in hill country and are able to cross over mountain ranges, but generally seem to avoid steeper terrain, particularly slopes &gt;20° (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have a feeding strategy similar to that observed in other equids in xeric environments. When grass is plentiful, Asiatic Wild Asses are predominately grazers. During the dry season and in drier habitats, Asiatic Wild Asses will supplement their diet with shrubs and switch to become mixed-feeders during certain seasons (Bannikov 1981, Xu <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Burnik-Sturm in prep.). Wild Asses, like all equids, need regular access to water and in captivity drink 1,020 litres daily, although they seem to be able to go without water for two to four days depending on ambient temperature and moisture content of the feed (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Water availability is a key resource and in summer months the species primarily occurs within 10-15 km of standing water. In Mongolia where the ground water level is high, Asiatic Wild Ass have been observed digging holes as deep as 60 cm in dry riverbeds to access water (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>Wild Asses are highly mobile, in the Mongolian Gobi collared animals covered average daily straight line distances of 11.9 km (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006) or cumulative distances of 21.8 km (Kaczensky unpubl. data) within 24 hours. Wild Ass movements do not seem to follow easily predictable patterns (classical migration), but are rather nomadic. This is likely the result of the unpredictability in the availability of pasture and water in space and time (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, von Wehrden <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In the past, when Wild Asses still occurred on mountain steppe and steppe habitats, they made seasonal migrations between summer ranges on the productive steppe habitats in the north to winter ranges in the drier, but less snowy areas in the south (Bannikov 1981).<br/><br/>Asiatic Wild Asses in Mongolia have huge annual ranges, the size of which increase from east to west, likely as a result of increasing unpredictability of pasture and water availability. In the Dzungarian Gobi annual ranges averaged 5,860 km<sup>2</sup>, in the Transaltai Gobi they ranged between 14,695-16,907&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, but in the southeast Gobi ranged from 18,186-69,988&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, Batsaikhan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Age at first reproduction seems to be three years for mares and five years for stallions. Mares can produce a foal annually under favourable conditions up to at least 15 years of age. Sex-ratio at birth is close to 50/50 (Bannikov 1981, Saltz and Rubenstein 1995, Volf 2010). Area specific data of Asiatic Wild Ass population dynamics parameters are largely lacking or anecdotal. For the re-introduced and intensively studied population on Barsa Kelmes Island average fertility of adult mares was estimated at 66.6%, but varied depending on pasture condition and winter severity (Bannikov 1981). Foal survival in the wild likely is in the magnitude of 50% and yearling survival is lower than adult survival (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Nowzari <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Kaczensky pers. obs.). Age determination of 350 skulls of Asiatic Wild Ass carcasses from the Mongolian Gobi documented a mean age of 9.1 years (for animals ≥3 years) and a maximum age of 29 years (Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). Average annual foal rates seem to be somewhere in the range of 1,020% (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). The species is polygynous and thus only a portion of the adult males contributes to reproduction, though what percentage is unknown, particularly as there is still limited understanding of the social organization of the species (Solomatin 1973, Bannikov 1981, Rubenstein 1986, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Klingel 1998 Shah 1993, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002 Neumann-Denzau and Denzau 2007, Rubenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Shah and Qureshi, 2007, Sundaresan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Data on population composition and age specific mortality rates are unavailable and most surveys did not state if and how foals were included in the estimates. Without more robust population dynamics data we assumed that the number of mature individuals roughly equals 50% of the total population making for a global population of mature animals of 27,900 animals.<br/><br/>We also compared our estimate with the known population composition of one re-introduced Przewalski’s horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalski</em>) population that shares part of the range of Asiatic Wild Asses in the Mongolian Gobi and nine Cape mountain zebra populations in South Africa. In the Przewalski’s horse population the proportion of mature individuals (≥3 years for mares and ≥5 years for stallions) averaged 61% (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data 2009, 2014) and for the Cape Mountain zebra populations ranged between 55-65% (S. King pers. comm. 2014, based on H. Hrabar unpubl. data).","Threats to Asiatic Wild Asses stem from illegal hunting for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties (Bannikov 1981, Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007), competition with humans and livestock over water and pasture use (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006), and crop depredation (primarily in India, Iran and Turkmenistan; S. Esmaeili pers. comm. 2013, N. Shah pers. comm. 2014, N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014, Feh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Other threats are habitat loss as a result of human settlement and cultivation, overgrazing and degradation, and limited access to open water sources (the mere presence of people and their livestock at water points can limit or block access for wild ass; Denzau and Denzau 1999, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Of increasing concern is the continued habitat fragmentation by linear infrastructure development projects (mostly roads and railways) associated with the booming extractive industry in Mongolia and China. Asiatic Wild Asses are unable to cross fences (e.g. along the border between Mongolia and China or Iran and Turkmenistan, or fenced transportation corridors like the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway), have long flight distances from vehicles in areas with a high poaching pressure, and suffer from vehicle collisions (e.g., from 2009-2013, 26 Wild Asses were killed by traffic in Israel; Waner 2014). If not mitigated, fenced and/or high volume traffic corridors can be expected to create serious movement barriers (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have become largely confined to semi-desert and desert areas with a high variability in water and pasture availability. To cope with this unpredictable environment and track the scarce resources available, Wild Asses need to have access to large tracts of land. This is particularly true in times of weather extremes, when&#160;Wild Asses&#160;need to outrun summer droughts or extreme winters (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b). Although protected areas may provide important refuges, long-term conservation of&#160;Wild Asses&#160;will have to happen on the landscape scale. New planning tools are needed, like the “planning for a moving target” approach suggested for Saiga (<em>Saiga tatarica</em>) in Kazakhstan (Singh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Bull <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Small, isolated populations are demographically and genetically vulnerable and prone to extinction, particularly in habitats with frequent environmental extremes (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Small and localised populations also have limited resilience to disease outbreaks&#160;or climate change. For example, a disease outbreak of African horse sickness in the 1960s resulted in a major decline and the extinction of small Khur populations (Gee 1963).<br/><br/><strong>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below:</strong><br/><br/>The main threats to Khulan in <strong>Mongolia </strong>remain competition for water and pasture with livestock. The temporally high illegal offtake in Mongolia seems to have largely ceased, but could be resumed if the economic situation becomes unstable. Newly emerging threats are rapid infrastructure development particularly in connection with resource extraction industries (mining) that could result in barriers to migrations/nomadic movements (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014) and habitat loss and degradation. The impacts of mining operation tapping into “ancient” aquifers on the active ground water table are not fully understood. The situation is complicated by a lack of capacity and funding to implement landscape scale planning and conservation. Furthermore, an estimated 60,0000 illegal “ninja” miners are degrading the habitat, polluting water sources and causing huge disturbance, though initiatives are under way transforming ninja mining into a formal sub-sector and developing mercury free processing techniques.<br/><br/>Threats in northern <strong>China </strong>stem from intensified resource extraction which already resulted in the de-gazetting of parts of Kalamaili Nature Reserve, fencing and competition with local herders and their livestock (Xia <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The situation in Gansu province is data deficient and potentially Wild Asses no longer occur in that region. The situation in Inner Mongolia is also unclear, the fence along the international border with Mongolia currently inhibits population exchange between the two countries.<br/><br/>Threats to Khur in the Little Rann of Kutch in <strong>India </strong>stem from increasing human activities. Land use patterns have changed since the Mega Narmada Dam Project which resulted in the Sardar Sarovar canals all around the protected area (Goyal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Uninformed release of Sardar Sarovar canal excess waters into the Rann is having an impact on the micro-habitat, the short grasslands and is restricting the movement of Khur and other species across the saline desert. Increased agricultural practices have converted fallow lands into irrigation fields, resulting in shrinking habitat for the existing Khur population. Religious activities, cattle breeding and influx of people have accelerated on the Islands or Bets of the Rann.<em> Prosopis juliflora</em> invasion is an additional threat to the habitat. An estimated 30-35% of the Khur population lives outside the protected area and human-Khur conflicts are increasing, particularly crop raiding. In recent years Khur have also been increasingly hit on the major express highway. The International Boundary with Pakistan has been fenced thus restricting any possibility of Khur movement beyond borders. Although the population has somewhat increased over the past years, foaling rates in Khur have been on the decline in recent years (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014). <br/><br/>In <strong>Kazakhstan </strong>Kulan in Altyn Emel National Park are thriving, but are believed to have reached carrying capacity. Transfers to Andassay Sanctuary have been resumed, but the status and whereabouts of the reintroduced animals is largely unknown due to a lack of post-release management. Poaching still seems to be a threat outside of Altyn Emel National Park.<br/><br/>In <strong>Iran </strong>upgrading the core zone of Bahram-e-Goor protected area to Qatrouiyeh National Park and providing water supplies and occasional hay resulted in an increase of the Onager population. In contrast, the large adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area seems to act as a sink for the population due to occupation of water sources and productive ranges by livestock coupled with insufficient capacity for ranger presence and patrolling. As a result, the Onager population is concentrated in Qatrouyeh national park, which is starting to show signs of high herbivory pressure from Onagers. In Touran protected area the distribution range and abundance of Onagers have been decreasing. Occupation of suitable Onager habitats by livestock, poaching (usually by chasing the animal by motorbike) and insufficient protection are the most important threats to the species in this reserve.<br/><br/>The situation of Kulan in <strong>Turkmenistan </strong>and <strong>Uzbekistan </strong>is largely data deficient. The accuracy of population estimates and the distribution range are unclear. The border fence with Iran and Afghanistan does not allow for cross-border movements to the south any more. The autochthonous population in the Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area is declining. Large parts of the Wild Ass population in Badkhyz leave the Strictly Protected Area in summer to access water sources like the Kuska or Islim rivers close to the Afghan border. Outside the protected area, competition with livestock and crop raiding leads to conflicts with the local population. Poaching remains a problem and harassment by shepherds and their dogs and overgrazing by livestock limits Kulan access to pastures and water outside the reserve (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The reintroduced wild ass population in <strong>Israel </strong>lives in an extremely arid environment prone to droughts and in summer there are only three permanent water sources (all artificial) within the current distribution area. Presently the major known mortality cause is Wild Ass vehicle collisions. Although population size has doubled since 1999, an increase in the probability of extreme events under the predicted climate change scenario may still make this population vulnerable to extinction as modelled by Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2006). Another simulation model, based on changes in allele frequencies, suggests that a strong polygynous mating system is leading to increased genetic drift (Renan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).","Population estimates of Asiatic Wild Asses are based on a wide variety of different field methods and estimation techniques ranging from attempted total counts based on ground transects or counts at strategically important habitat features (e.g. water points, winter range), population estimates based on strip transects or line transects either from the ground or air, and sign surveys. Details on survey design or details on the statistical procedures that lead to the final population estimates were rarely available. Funds and capacity for monitoring are often very limited and several population estimates are rather old. Consequently, estimates provided should be treated as best available information on the magnitude of the Wild Ass populations and their trends in the respective countries.<br/><br/>Free ranging Asiatic Wild Ass populations currently occur in eight countries in 17 more or less isolated populations with an estimated global population of 55,000 animals.<br/><br/>The largest remaining Wild Ass population, found in southern Mongolia and parts of adjacent China, had been estimated at 18,411 (± 898) for Mongolia in 2003 based on ground transects (Lhagvasuren 2007). However, new counts suggest that this survey greatly underestimated the population due to methodological constrains of covering such a huge area on the ground. A large-scale aerial survey estimated 32,843 (± 10,571) Wild Asses over 150,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the southeast Gobi in 2013 (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015) plus likely an additional 1,723 Wild Asses in the no-flight buffer zone along the Mongolian-Chinese border based on a parallel ground survey (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Three large-scale spring time ground surveys resulted in comparable population estimates of 35,899 (18 %CV) in 2013, 39,998 (27%CV) in 2014, and 36,298 (27%CV) in 2015 (Buuveibaatar <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep.) A simultaneous point count in 2010 estimated another 5,671 (3611–8907) Wild Asses over 11,027 km<sup>2</sup> in the Dzungarian Gobi (Ransom <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). These data suggest a population of over 40,000 individuals in Mongolia, with likely an additional 1,500 in the Transaltai Gobi as there have been no reported changes there since the 1997 aerial survey (Reading <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2001), plus further animals in the eastern Gobi, giving an estimate of over 42,000 animals. Based on these updated population estimates, Mongolia houses 75% of the global population of Asiatic Wild Ass. Genetic analysis of samples collected from 2002–2005 suggested gene flow over the entire range in Mongolia (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011), but this may have been compromised by recent infrastructure development.<br/><br/>An additional ~5,000 Wild Asses are believed to occur in adjacent China, primarily in Xinjiang province (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). With the upgrading of the fence along the international border in the 1980s and 1990s, population exchange between Mongolia and China has likely ceased or at least become minimal (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011a, Kaczensky unpubl. data). Consequently, the Chinese populations should be regarded as separate from Mongolia.<br/><br/>The third largest population is found in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007). In 2009 the official estimate for this population was ~4,000 animals (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The fourth largest population is found in Altyn Emel National Park in southeast Kazakhstan. This population was re-established via reintroductions and is currently estimated at ~2,500-3,000 animals (Plakhov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, S.V. Sokolov pers. comm. 2011, R. Habibrakhmanov pers. comm. 2014). Two additional, isolated reintroduced populations are found in Kazakhstan: 1) on Barsa-Kelmes Island with an estimated ~347 animals (Meldebekov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 2) in Andassay Sanctuary with an estimated ~35 animals (Levanov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The total population in Kazakhstan is approximately 3,100 animals.<br/><br/>The fifth largest population is found in Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in south-central Iran, estimated at 632 (429-939) individuals of which 15% were foals in summer 2014 (M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014). While the Bahram-e-Gour population has shown a positive trend in recent years, the second population in the Touran protected area complex in northern Iran seems to have severely decreased to a mere ~145 animals (summer census 2014 - M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Any potential exchange with the population in adjacent Turkmenistan is inhibited by the fence along the international border. A recent reintroduction resulted in 12 free-ranging animals in Kalmand protected area. The total population in Iran is around 790 animals.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan Wild Asses only survived in Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area, bordering Iran and Afghanistan. The 2013 estimate for Badkhyz was ~420 individuals (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014), a 50% reduction in the population since the 2008 assessment. Rapid assessments from 2012, 2014 and 2015 suggest that the population may be even lower than 420 individuals (Kuznetsov pers. comm. 2015, Kaczensky and Linnell 2015). From Badkhyz Wild Asses were reintroduced to multiple other localities within Turkmenistan (Pavlov 1996, Lukarevskiy and Gorelov. 2007). The reintroduction to the Sarykamysh reserve was the most successful and the population is estimated at ~300-350 animals, also spreading into adjacent Uzbekistan where another ~50 animals are believed to live (Kuznetsov 2014, N. Marmazinskaja unpubl. data 2012/2013). The other reintroduction sites are all in the south, with an estimated ~100 animals in Meana Chaacha Reserve, ~13 in Western Kopetdag, and ~10-15 in Kuruhaudan (V. Kuznetsov unpubl. data 2012 and 2013). The total population in Turkmenistan and adjacent Uzbekistan is about 920 animals.<br/><br/>The reintroduced population in the Negev in Israel is currently estimated at 250 animals (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Two projects reintroduced Wild Ass populations into large enclosures – so called semi-reserves. The Dzheiran Ecocentre in Uzbekistan is 51 km<sup>2</sup> and houses a population of 98 animals (N. Soldatova unpubl. data 2013) and the Birjutschii peninsula in Ukraine is 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and houses 91 animals (Pavlov 1996, O. Yaremchenko pers. comm. 2014). However, these populations were not included in the IUCN Red List assessment. The planned reintroduction in Taif, Saudi Arabia never happened and no animals remain at the enclosure (Denzau and Denzau 1999, Int. Studbook Of Asiatic Wild Asses - Onager Studbook).<br/><br/>The population trend since the last Red List assessment in 2008 seems more or less stable in Mongolia, is data deficient in China, seems stable or slightly increasing in India, shows a mixed trend in Iran (with Touran dramatically decreasing, but Bahram-e-Goor increasing), is increasing or stable in Kazakhstan,&#160;data deficient&#160;in Turkmenistan (decrease in Badkhyz, but increase in Sarykamysh Reserve), increasing in Uzbekistan from Sarykamysh Reserve, and increasing in Israel.<br/><br/>See Table 1 and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material.",Stable,"In historic times the Asiatic Wild Ass ranged throughout the steppes and desert steppes of the Russian Federation, Mongolia, northern China, northwest India, Central Asia, the Middle East, including Iran, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia Minor (Bannikov 1981, Heptner <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>1988, Denzau and Denzau 1999). Today the species' main stronghold is southern Mongolia and adjacent China. All other remaining populations are small and largely isolated from each other. One subspecies, the Syrian Wild Ass (<em>E. h. hemippus</em>), became extinct in 1927.<br/> <br/> <em>Equus hemionus</em> may have lost as much as 70% of its range since the 19th century and is now regionally extinct in most of its former range countries primarily due to competition with livestock for pastures and water and severe over-hunting (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). The largest remaining population is found in southern Mongolia (Reading <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Ransom <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,Norton-Griffiths&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and parts of adjacent China (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). The species also survives as isolated populations in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007), the Badkhyz Reserve in Turkmenistan (Lukarevski and Gorelov 2007) and in the Touran protected area complex and Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in Iran (Tatin <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2003, Hemami and Momeni 2013). <br/> <br/> The species has been re-established via reintroductions in Kazakhstan and Israel. Additional reintroductions have somewhat re-expanded its range in Turkmenistan (also spreading into Uzbekistan) and established two populations in large enclosures in Uzbekistan and Ukraine. The re-established population in Israel is not of the subspecies that originally occurred there, but rather of mixed <em>E. h. kulan</em> and <em>E. h. onager</em> origin (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2014).<p></p>","Illegal trade seems to happen primarily on a national level and stem from poaching for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties.<br/><br/>Illegal off-take in Mongolia peaked in the early 2000s and also included large scale market hunting (Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em>et al.</em> 2007), but currently seems to be much reduced. However, illegal off-take has been identified as a key threat in parts of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iran and China and may well drive some of the small populations into extinction if not stopped.",Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Wild Ass is legally protected in all range countries. CITES has listed the subspecies <em>E.h. hemionus</em> (Mongolian Khulan) and <em>E.h. khur</em> (Indian Khur) on Appendix I and all other subspecies on Appendix II since 1975. The full species is listed on Annex A of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2013. The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) listed the species on Appendix II in 2002 (UNEP/CMS 2002b). The&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;is one of the key species in the Central Asian Mammals Initiative (CAMI) of CMS (Karlstetter and Mallon 2014).<br/><br/>In all range countries protected areas have been established with the goal to protect&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses. However, almost all protected areas seem too small to sustain a population year-round or accommodate population recovery. At the fringes of protected areas conflicts with the local population tend to be increasing and/or Asiatic Wild Asses are subject to high levels of illegal killing. Consequently, landscape scale planning and integrative approaches that also take local people’s needs into account are needed for future conservation planning. Unfortunately China just de-gazetted substantial parts of the Kalamaili Nature reserve, a major stronghold of wild asses in Xinjiang, to allow coal mining (Xia <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area in Turkmenistan (M. Day pers. comm. 2014) and the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia (T. Jaeger pers. comm. 2014) have been listed as possible candidate sites for nomination as UNESCO world heritage sites. For Badkhyz an expansion of the State Nature Reserve, additional adjacent nature reserves and an ecological corridor safeguarding the seasonal migrations of&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are being currently implemented. A ‘transboundary ecological corridor’ connecting Kalamaili Nature Reserve in Xinjiang province in China, and Great Gobi A and B Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia via the limited entry border area of northern Xinjiang and southern Mongolia has been suggested to re-establish transboundary&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;movements (Kaczensky <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011a, Xu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but will likely fail without political lobbying.<br/><br/>Although rapid infrastructure development is likely creating one of the biggest challenges for the conservation of migratory and nomadic ungulates, No Net Loss (NNL) or Net Positive Impact (NPI) policies adopted by industry, and newly emerging standards on Biodiversity Offsets (BBOP 2012) are powerful tools that may enable economic development to combine with biodiversity conservation, and offsets may actually provide a more flexible tool to conserve nomadic species (Bull <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). In Mongolia, the largest mine Oyu Tolgoi is operating on a NPI policy and&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are a key species of concern.<br/><br/>Reintroductions have re-established the&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Israel and somewhat expanded its range in Turkmenistan. The reintroduced populations contribute ~8% to the global population, but only managed to reoccupy a tiny fraction of the species former range. New reintroductions are currently discussed in Kazakhstan and Iran. However, care has to be taken that reintroduction projects do not distract attention and funds from conserving the remaining autochthonous populations.<br/><br/>Whereas increasing monitoring and research efforts are made in Mongolia, Israel, Xinjiang province in China, India and Bahram-e-Goor in Iran, little systematic information is available from Inner Mongolia and Gansu province in China, Touran protected area complex in Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Furthermore, major research gaps exist regarding: i) the human dimension of&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;management and conservation, ii) site specific population dynamics parameters, iii) triggers, drivers, and scale of nomadic or seasonal movements, iv) impact and mitigation of barriers.<br/><br/>A Programme of Work for the CMS Central Asian Mammal Initiative (CAMI) was agreed during the Stakeholder Meeting on the Conservation of Large Mammals in Central Asia, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (2325 September 2014) and included a recommendation to develop a single-species action plan for the Asiatic Wild Ass as a high priority.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
166527449,19757,Rousettus obliviosus,Vulnerable,B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii),2020,2016-05-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species has a limited range; both its extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are less than thresholds of 20,000 km² and&#160; 2,000 km², respectively (the minimum convex polygon including all three islands it inhabits is 9,085 km², and the total area of all three islands it inhabits is 1,783 km²). It is also known to exist at no more than ten locations (seven consistently-used roosting caves are known), and it is experiencing a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat (due to increasing human pressures leading to substantial loss of native forests; ongoing loss of trees from plantations, orchards, and agroforestry areas; and increasing human disturbance at roost sites). Thus, the species is listed as Vulnerable under B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii).","The Comoros Islands harbour a distinct forest type of tropical moist broadleaf forest, part of the ‘Comoros forests’ ecoregion (Olson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001), which formerly served as the foraging habitat for <em>R. obliviosus</em>. However, nearly all large patches of this forest type, except in some higher elevations, have been destroyed. In parts of the remaining forest, the understory has been replaced by banana plantations, taro, or clove trees. <em>R. obliviosus </em>has been widely recorded as occurring in native forest, underplanted forest, and heavily-degraded forest within agricultural zones (Clark <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997, Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Goodman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b). These records, and the presence in its diet of fruit from cultivated, non-native trees (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003), suggest that this species has thus far been able to exploit human-dominated landscapes – including agroforestry lands and orchards, as well as agricultural landscapes retaining remnant trees and forest patches – as foraging habitat. <em>R. obliviosus</em> has not been observed in villages or towns (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Goodman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b).<br/><br/><em>Rousettus obliviosus</em> is a cave-roosting species that is only known to roost in caves and shallow rock shelters in areas infrequently visited by people (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). The species appears to be selective in roost sites, as it has been found in &lt;20% of surveyed caves (Middleton 1998, 1999; Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003; Hume and Middleton 2011; Middleton, pers. comm.; BJS, pers. obs.). Roosting habitat is either large lava tubes that are difficult to access or cave localities or shallow rock overhangs associated with streams or waterfalls in remote areas with steep terrain or dense vegetation (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). Availability of such roosting habitat appears critical for this species. The lack of suitable roosting habitat on Mayotte may explain the absence of this species there (Goodman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b) even though the species is capable of traversing open water over distances equal to that between Mayotte and its nearest neighbour, Anjouan (Goodman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010a).","<em>Rousettus obliviosus</em> has a limited range; its area of occupancy is less than the total area of the three islands (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003), which is 1,783 km² (Louette <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), and its extent of occurrence (including unsuitable ocean areas between the islands) is less than 9,085 km². It is therefore susceptible to single threatening processes, like cyclones, that could simultaneously or rapidly affect its entire range.<br/><br/>The major threat to the species within this range appears to be disturbance at roost sites. The bats appear highly susceptible to human disturbance, and infrequent hunting and rock falls in unstable lava tubes have been recorded at roost sites (Middleton 1998, 1999; Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Additionally, cave surveys between 2000-2005 revealed the bats were absent from three caves where they apparently formerly occurred (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, W. Masefield, pers. comm.), though it is unclear whether this suggests intermittent use of some roost sites or abandonment after disturbance.<br/><br/>Over the last few decades, the Comoros have undergone a sustained, rapid deforestation, resulting in the loss of nearly all its native forests. During the past 20 years alone, the country has lost 75% of its remaining forests, the fastest rate of any country in the world (UNDP 2013). Human pressures on native forests are expected to continue, as the growth rate of the human population remains high at 2.5% (UNDP 2013). Because <em>R. obliviosus</em> is regularly recorded in human-modified landscapes, loss of foraging habitat via deforestation is possibly not a major threat (Bergmans 1994). However, even human-modified landscapes containing non-native and remnant native trees are disappearing in the Comoros to make room for ground crops (FAO 2010, BJS pers. obs.); thus food resources for this species have probably been declining in recent years. Further, the loss of natural and underplanted forests may reduce its ability to cope with droughts and cyclones, and may limit its access to food resources when fruit from horticultural species is unavailable (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). In addition, the replacement of native forests with agricultural land on Anjouan and Mohéli may render formerly inaccessible roost sites on Anjouan and Mohéli more easily reached, possibly exposing roosts to increased levels of human disturbance. Finally, the loss of native forests has resulted in impermanence or complete drying of nearly all rivers on Anjouan and most on Mohéli (Louette <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). <em>R. obliviosus</em> roosts on those islands are typically near waterfalls, and it is unclear whether that is simply where suitable caves and rock shelters occur or if the bats benefit from the adjacent water source. The species could benefit from an adjacent water source if, for instance, local humidity reduces evaporative water loss in the normally hot climate of the Comoros. If so, then it is possible the seasonal or year-round loss of water flow could affect this species on Anjouan and Mohéli as well.","<em>Rousettus obliviosus</em> is rarely observed outside of research studies due to its nocturnal foraging and cryptic roosting habits. It has nonetheless been captured frequently by bat researchers (Reason <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Clark <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1997, Sewall <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003, Goodman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010b), and thus the species is considered fairly common (Reason <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Louette <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, Goodman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010b). The true population size is unknown. The only abundance estimates available are from roost counts, and very few roost sites are known. Sewall <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2003) searched Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli and found or confirmed five permanent roosts plus a sixth that was intermittently used. They estimated that colony size at roosts ranges from around 100 to several thousand animals, and that the total population of these six sites was between 7,100 and 17,100 bats (Sewall <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003). Since then, two additional roosts have been discovered, one small (~100 bats) and one mid-sized (~2,000 bats) (Hume and Middleton 2011, I. Saïd and W. Masefield pers. comm.). Thus, the current population at known roosts is estimated to number about 10,000 to 20,000 bats. Estimates of demographic parameters from genetic analyses suggest recent population stability in this species (Goodman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010a). Further, no genetic population structure is evident among the three islands, despite separation of at least 40 km of open water between adjacent islands; this indicates inter-island dispersal (Goodman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010a).",Unknown,"<em>Rousettus obliviosus</em> has been recorded only from the three islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli of the Union of the Comoros, western Indian Ocean (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Louette <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Goodman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010b). The species has been recorded from 30-1,750 m on Grande Comore, from 200 to 1,350 m on Anjouan, and from 10-700 m on Mohéli (Meirte 1984, Reason <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1994, Sewall <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Goodman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010b). Since the highest points on these islands are 2,361 m, 1,595 m, and 790 m, respectively (Battistini and Vérin 1984), and since diverse canopy rainforest or cloud forest habitat is replaced by tree-fern, scrub, grassland, or heath habitat above 1,800 m on Mt. Karthala on Grande Comore (Louette <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004), the bat species probably occurs from near sea level to about 1,800 m on Grande Comore, and across most of the elevational ranges of Anjouan and Mohéli. These records also suggest that the area of occupancy is less than the total area of the three islands (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003), which is 1,783 km² (Louette <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004). Likewise, these records suggest that the extent of occurrence is less than the total area of the three islands and intervening unsuitable ocean habitat, which is 9,085 km². The species is apparently absent from Mayotte, the other large island in the Comoros Archipelago, as it has never been observed there despite extensive searching and trapping effort (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Louette <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Goodman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010b).",Infrequent hunting has been recorded.,Terrestrial,"<em>Rousettus obliviosus </em>receives the highest level of legal protection available in the Union of the Comoros. It is listed as an ‘integrally-protected species’ (list 1 of RFIC 2001), which prohibits the capture or detention of <em>R. obliviosus</em> individuals without a permit. This law also expressly prohibits the killing of members of the Family Pteropodidae (flying foxes); transport, purchase, sale, export or re-export of living or dead individuals or their body parts; all disruption during the period of reproduction and raising of young; and the destruction of roosts (RFIC 2001). The Union of the Comoros also ratified the <em>Convention on Biological Diversity</em> in 1994, and in response has developed a <em>National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy </em>(Roby and Dossar 2000). This strategy highlights the importance of, threats to, and conservation recommendations for fruit bats of the Union of the Comoros (Sewall and Granek 2000). In practice, however, there are currently no direct conservation actions in place for <em>R. obliviosus</em>, and no formal terrestrial protected areas in the country.<br/><br/>The national <em>Conservation Action Plan</em> for <em>Pteropus livingstonii</em> (Sewall <em>et al.</em> 2007), another threatened pteropodid from the Comoros, includes an appendix for the conservation of <em>Rousettus obliviosu</em>s. This appendix addresses current and potential emerging threats to <em>R. obliviosus</em>, and recommends five targeted conservation actions for <em>R. obliviosus</em>. Specifically, it recommends (1) protection of roost caves, especially the caves with the largest known colony on each island (these are now thought to be Panga Chilamouinani near Fassi on Grande Comore, Bakomdrundru near Ndrondroni on Mohéli, and Mangua Mitsano near Limbi on Anjouan); (2) discouraging, through environmental education, the hunting of all fruit bats; (3) conducting a comprehensive field search for more roost sites; (4) providing incentives to individuals owning land near roost sites to conserve caves and bats; and (5) devising a suitable population monitoring protocol and conducting regular visits to all known roost sites to track population changes (Sewall <em>et al.</em> 2007). Other key actions for this species include efforts to prevent further native forest habitat loss and additional studies designed to track the species’ population and inform its management (Sewall <em>et al.</em> 2003).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Future population reduction of 80% or more is possible should the rate of decline in forest cover approach levels reached several years back and continue for the next three generations (2019-2048). This is especially likely if the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR) is officially annulled,&#160;an action now being considered&#160;by national authorities.

The High Grand Falls Dam, the second largest dam in Africa, will be accompanied by large-scale irrigation schemes and water transfer to the ‘Lamu Port and Lamu Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor’. The establishment of this dam is expected to have additional negative impacts on the forests of the Lower Tana River and, therefore, on<em> P. rufomitratus.</em></p><p><em></em>One special concern is the rapidly growing human population in the region.

Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 2,545 km<sup>2&#160; </sup>and its area of occupancy (AOO) is 140 km<sup>2</sup>. A continuing decline in the extent and  quality of its habitat has been  observed due to hydropower projects, water pollution from domestic and agricultural sources,   logging and gem mining activities and increased sedimentation. The   species is also threatened by ornamental fish trade, overfishing for   local consumption and competition and predation from introduced invasive  alien species. These threats are likely to continue as the area is   undergoing agricultural expansion of rubber and tea plantations and   there is no current protection for the majority of its habitat. The   species is therefore assessed as Endangered.","This species is associated with clear water streams with relatively low currents. It tends to avoid sun-lit areas and is primarily herbivorous, browsing on algal cover (De Silva and Kortmulder 1997). Is is a small fish with a maximum standard size of 41.2 mm (Meegaskumbura <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008).","This species has a limited range which lies mostly outside of protected areas, making it vulnerable to a number of threats.&#160;A major threat to this species is from the ornamental freshwater fish trade, both from extensive harvesting for exportation and the release of imported invasive species. In 2005, 7,891 individuals of this species were exported to around 48 countries, with&#160;as much as 98% of exported fish being collected from the wild in the mid 2000s (Gunasekera 2011). This is thought to be causing declines in populations throughout its range. <br/><br/>As of 2016, Sri Lanka has 12 alien freshwater fish established due to the release of ornamental fish, five of which have been identified as seriously invasive. Impacts include competition, predation and stream alteration from burrowing behaviour (Sudasinghe 2016).&#160;This species is also threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation from a number of sources. The most significant of these is thought to be from the development of hydropower projects and construction of damns, which divert water, change downstream flows, and alter turbidity and temperature fluxes. In the last two decades, the 'wet zone' of Sri Lanka has seen a large number of these projects being developed (Senanyaket and Moyle 1982). Other threats include&#160;pollution from domestic and agricultural sources, gem mining, exploitation for local consumption, flash flooding as a result of climate change and deforestation, and a loss of habitat from logging and the creation of rubber and tea plantations, which reduces shading and vegetation load and alters temperature fluxes (Senanyaket and Moyle 1982).","This species is endemic to the south-west of Sri Lanka, and so it has a restricted range and there is limited population information available to determine how common it is throughout this range. Population declines have been inferred from declines in habitat extent and quality caused by hydropower projects, pollution from domestic and agricultural sources and human disturbance of bank vegetation. Declines have also been inferred from information on the export of this species for the ornamental fish trade.",Decreasing,"This species is an endemic freshwater fish distributed in south-western Sri Lanka in the Kalu, Bentara and Gin River Basins (Meegaskumbura <em>et al</em>. 2008, De Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;It is found in the districts of Kalutara, Ratnapura, Galle and Kegalle.","This species is harvested for the ornamental freshwater fish trade and also for local consumption&#160;(Senanayake and Moyle 1982).<br/><br/> In 2005, 7,891 individuals of this species were exported to around 48   countries, with the highest amount going to the USA and European   countries such as the UK, France and Germany (Gunasekera 2011).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is migratory and travels north after breeding to overwinter in the Arctic Ocean (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It arrives on its breeding grounds in late-May, where it breeds from early-June in loose colonies of 2-10 pairs (rarely up to 18 pairs) often with other species (e.g. Arctic Tern <em>Sterna paradisaea</em>) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The departure from the breeding grounds occurs from late-July onwards, with the species migrating in small flocks of 2-16 individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It forages solitarily or in small loose flocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in the upper boreal forest (taiga) and tundra zones of the high Arctic, showing a preference for nesting on small, low islets in shallow pools (created by snow-melt on tundra underlain with permafrost) surrounded by stands of stunted alder <em>Alnus</em> spp. and willow <em>Salix</em> spp. and by muddy, boggy or marshy ground with sedges and moss (Richards 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Olsen and Larsson 2003). The species also breeds on marshy tundra in high Arctic river deltas and on marshy ground in well-wooded river valleys (Richards 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season, the species forages pelagically on the open sea or along the edges of pack-ice (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> On its breeding grounds, the species is chiefly insectivorous, its diet including Coleoptera and dipteran flies (Richards 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> On migration and in the winter, its diet consists of small fish and surface-dwelling marine invertebrates (including plankton, crustaceans, molluscs and priapulid marine worms) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of dry grass, sedge and moss, usually on a tussock on an island in a pool in the tundra or forest (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species nests in near invisible colonies, often with other species, with an average distance between neighbouring nests of 43 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The species is strongly associated with areas of sea ice, especially in the post-breeding period (Gilg <em>et al</em>. 2016), and the alteration in ice distribution and indeed ongoing loss of ice may have already caused a shift in a least a portion of the species's annual movements (Joiris 2017). More research is urgently required, particularly as breeding success appears to be very low (typically less than 33%) (Burger <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species also faces a number of more direct human threats, such as nest failures as a result of human disturbance in Canada (Burger <em>et al</em>. 2018) and being shot by native Alaskan peoples for food (Burger <em>et al</em>. 2018). These, however, do not seem to be causing a significant decline.","The global population is estimated to number c.25,000-100,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016), which equates to c.15,000-70,000 mature individuals. At least 20,000 (up to 38,000) individuals move past Point Barrow, Alaska, in autumn (Maftei <em>et al</em>. 2014).

It can breed on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992). Data reveals it is almost continuously on the wing, with morphology and flight pattern resulting in extremely low costs of foraging, relying on prey driven to the surface by underwater predators such as tuna. Low cost of flight due to extensive use of thermals allows exploitation of tropical waters in which prey is scarce (Weimerskirch <em>et al.</em> 2003). It feeds mainly on flying-fish and squid, but also jellyfish, baby turtles, seabird eggs and chicks, offal and fish scraps (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","Hunting likely occurs at numerous breeding sites, causing slow but significant population declines. The sub-population of Cape Verde has decreased to the point of extinction following persecution by fishermen (Orta <em>et al.</em> 2018). Development of commercial and domestic areas in the Caribbean is responsible for local declines in populations and their breeding success, alongside the loss of coastal roosting sites that are vitally important to the species as it does not rest on water during the day. These developments have not yet been documented to have adverse effects on the total population. After unexpected high rates of nest failure following bird handling, the impact of different sampling methods on nest success were tested and revealed that wing tags have a substantial negative effect on pre-fledging nest success (Trefry <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The global population is estimated to number 130,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of America, from California (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>) to <strong>Ecuador</strong> (including the Galapagos), and from Florida to south <strong>Brazil</strong>.

While it is nomadic, birds living in the moist grassland biome are less likely to be nomadic, but will will travel on average 20-30 km per day while foraging (Kemp &amp; Kemp, 1977; Whitecross <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>Breeding occurs throughout the year and the species typically nests in a flat-topped&#160;<em>Acacia</em>&#160;or other thorny tree, where it constructs a flattened stick structure (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001<strong></strong>)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Kenya, breeding attempts were observed to be disturbed by long droughts and unfavourable weather conditions (B. Amakobe, <em>in litt. </em>2020).

The excessive burning of grasslands may suppress populations of prey species, whilst the intensive grazing of livestock is also probably degrading otherwise suitable habitat (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The Grassland Biome in South Africa is threatened by the expansion of woody vegetation, which would translate to direct habitat loss and a possible reduction in foraging efficacy (Colyn <em>et al., </em>2020, <em>in review</em>). In Kenya, suitable habitat is being converted to other land uses, particularly for commercial purposes (B. Amakobe <em>in litt. </em>2020). Disturbance by humans, probably most often herders, is likely to negatively affect breeding. The species is captured and traded in apparently small numbers; however, it is unknown how many die in captivity and transit. Direct hunting and nest-raiding for other uses and indiscriminate poisoning at waterholes are also potential threats. Exposure to secondary pesticide poisoning is a concern, and birds are also susceptible to negative impacts from collisions with fence lines and electric cables (Whitecross <em>et al.</em> 2019). 94 power-line fatalities have been recorded in 20 years by the Endangered Wildlife Trust (A.

While the island population in Japan has grown rapidly in recent decades into a large and now stable proportion of the global population, the continental Asian population has declined rapidly. Overall the species remains at high risk of extinction due to multiple threats affecting the small and still declining continental population and to the dependence of the population in Japan on active conservation. The overall current and future rate of population reduction has slowed as the stable Japanese population has increased as a proportion of the global population, such that future rates of reduction are suspected to slow further. However the overall population size remains small even with this population close to a predicted maximum size and, with the long generation length of the species, indications of population reductions impacting the global population size would require the swift reassessment of the species. <br/><br/>In order to prevent the extinction of the continental population coordinated action is necessary to ensure the continued and increased availability of extensive wetlands in which the species is protected from disturbance. Currently, the population wintering in China is very close to extinction, and that wintering in the Korean peninsula restricted to increasingly small patches of suitable habitat. The genetic distinction of the continental and island populations mean that preventing the regional extinction of the former is a priority for the long-term persistence of the species. Further loss and degradation of suitable wetlands through conversion to agriculture and industrial development must be avoided. <p></p>","In Russia and China, it breeds in grass, reed, and sedge marshes. In winter and on passage, it occurs in wetlands, including tidal flats, saltmarshes, rivers, wet grassland, saltpans and aquaculture ponds and in artificial feeding grounds (in Japan). Tidal mudflat crab <em>Helice tientsinensis</em> has been found to be an important food source during migration, alongside smaller numbers of &#160;other crab species (<em>Eriocheir sinensis, Macrophthalmus dilatatum</em>), fish and ragworms <em>Hediste diversicolor </em>(Li <em>et al. </em>2014)<em>.</em>&#160;It also feeds on croplands, where it is vulnerable to poisons (Y. Momose<em> in litt.</em> 2016). Level of human disturbance and flock size has been found to influence time spent being vigilant by this species&#160;wintering in the Yancheng Biosphere Reserve, China (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2011). Landscape and plot level factors are important in explaining crane occurrence, including presence of seepweed tide flats, tamarisk-seepweed tidal flats, reed marshes and other natural wetlands. In the Yellow River Delta Nature Reserve, China, the species was negatively associated with roads (Cao<em> et al. </em>2015).<p></p>","The key threat is the loss and degradation of wetlands in its breeding and wintering grounds, principally for conversion to agriculture, but also aquaculture, industrial and economic development (J. Harris<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2007, 2009; Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). Due to habitat loss, the winter range in China is now only 8% of the extent present in the 1980s (Su and Zou 2012), resulting in high concentrations of cranes at few sites (Wang Qi-shan 2008). Further impacts on the wintering habitat comes from the invasive cordgrass <em>Spartima alterniflora </em>which has made a large extent of the feeding areas in the intertidal zone unsuitable for the species (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wintering areas in the Civilian Control Zone in Korea are increasingly cluttered and fragmented by agricultural infrastructure and powerlines, plus agricultural activity is now permitted for more of the year (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). Many breeding areas are impacted by changes in hydrology due to water control and diversions (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019).&#160;Rainfall patterns in the breeding grounds appear to follow a 30-year cycle, and the current dry period has meant birds, people and livestock have had to depend on ever smaller areas of wetland, also resulting in increased pressure to divert water from rivers and lakes (Harris 2008). Water control has also led to the loss of suitable habitat within Xianghai and Keerqin NNRs, resulting in the abandonment of these protected areas by the species (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). Dam construction on Hailaer River in China, and the Zeya and Bureya Rivers plus tributaries in Russia has changed the processes maintaining wet habitats, each to the detriment of breeding Red-crowned Cranes (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). Future construction of dams on the Amur river and its tributaries is a threat (W, Heim&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Additionally, spring fires destroy suitable nesting grounds, and lower water levels allow predators access to nests and destroying suitable breeding sites (J. Harris<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2007, 2009). The water level at the key site of Zhalong Nature Reserve (China)&#160;has been impacted following the construction of canals, and the lowered water table has allowed fires to spread across the area (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). But inappropriate wetland restoration at Zhalong has also been recorded as causing inappropriately-timed floods leading to nest failure (Wang and&#160;Li 2008).<br/><br/>Human disturbance has been so high as to prevent individuals from nesting in some areas (J. Harris <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2009) and has been found to influence vigilance behaviour (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2011) and exacerbated the impact of predators (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). <br/><br/>There is high adult mortality in some continental wintering areas which is apparently due to poisoning&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">(Harris and Mirande 2013); the species has been found to carry high levels of heavy metal contamination (Teraoka 2008), and the incidence of poisoning has been increasing in recent years (Harris 2008, Su Liying <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Su&#160;and Zou 2012,<em> </em>Luo <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;&#160;Poaching has also been suggested as a threat (Su Liying <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008) and some cranes and their eggs are taken for the captive trade (Su and Zou 2012). In the Demilitarised Zone in the Korean Peninsula, the shift to autumn ploughing is reducing access to waste grain (Lee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), resulting in the species disappearing from wintering sites in the DPRK (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). Further shifts in crops (e.g. from Job's Tears and corn <em>Zea mays </em>to ginseng in Korea or increased cotton growing in China [Momose and&#160;Momose 2019]) further restricts food availability. There is great uncertainty regarding the long-term fate of the crane habitat on the Korean Peninsula, whatever the political future delivers.<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;<br/><br/>In Japan, the concentration of birds at feeding stations means there is a risk of disease, especially given the low genetic diversity of the population, which passed through a bottleneck in the 1950s (J. Harris <em>in litt.</em> 2007, 2009; Wang Qi-shan 2008).&#160;<p></p></span>","Red-crowned Crane count data has been compiled with the assistance of the International Crane Foundation, IUCN Species Survival Commission Crane Specialist Group, the Red-crowned Crane Conservancy &amp; species experts from each range country of the species (ICF/BirdLife International, unpublished data). The sum of all most recent counts in discrete wintering areas is&#160;3,822 individuals; 1,900 in Japan in 2020 (Red-crowned Crane Conservancy 2020), 1,669 individuals in Korea (International Red-crowned Crane Network, unpublished data) and 353 in China (International Red-crowned Crane Network, unpublished data). The proportion of mature individuals has previously been estimated at around 60% (Jim Harris <em>in litt. </em>2016). Accepting this as a precautionary proportion, the estimated number of mature individuals is 2,293, rounded here to 2,300 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Data for Japan is based on systematic monitoring to produce a total for each year (Red-crowned Crane Conservancy 2021). In 1973, the population was 213 individuals, whereas in 2020-21 it was 1,900 individuals (Red-crowned Crane Conservancy 2021). The increase in the Japan population has been very rapid for a bird with such a long generation length and has been driven by the provision of winter food at feeding stations and high level of protection granted to the species. Recent attempts to reduce the dependency of the population on the few feeding sites appear to have resulted in the stabilisation of the population at around 1,800-1,900 individuals: 1,850 were counted in 2015-16, falling to 1,600 in 2017-18 before climbing back to 1,900 in 2020-21 (Red-crowned Crane Conservancy 2021). This results in an estimated increase in the Japanese population of 780% over the past three generations. There is the expectation that this population will be managed such that numbers do not grow further, and numbers may reduce slightly as efforts to reduce the dependence of the population on supplementary feeding take effect.<br/><br/>The continental population is divided into those wintering in China and those wintering in the Korean Peninsula. The population in China has declined rapidly over at least the past three decades. Fewer data are available, however systematic counts have been attempted in some years. In the early 1960s, more than 1,500 individuals were estimated to be wintering in coastal Jiangsu (Shi Zerong and&#160;Wu Lingxiang 1987) and while this was the most significant wintering area there were still numerous additional sites occupied by small numbers, including Hongze Hu, Gaoyou Hu, Shaobo Hu in Jiangsu, Xinglong Sha of southern Jiangsu and eastern tidal flats of Chongming Islands in Shanghai, and Lake Shijiu Hu in Anhui (S. Chan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2021). As such, the total wintering population is assumed to have been considerably more than 1,500 individuals at the start of the past three-generation period (1973). While small numbers have continued to be observed at some of these sites (such as recent observations of a family of four at Shijiu Hu (Anhui Bird Watching Club 2021), these sites no longer hold a regular wintering population and the species had been lost from most by the late 1980s (S. Chan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2021). With the concentration of birds at few wintering sites more recent estimates of numbers are considered more accurate. A total of 1,163 individuals were estimated in winter 1999-2000, almost all (1,128) of which were at Yancheng National Nature Reserve (Wang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). This was the highest count at the site of the annual numbers supplied for 1981-82 through to 2019 (Wang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008,&#160;Wang <em>et al. </em>2020, Q. Fawen&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2021). It is assumed that the increases up to 1999-2000 can be assigned to a concentration of individuals at Yancheng NNR. Most other individuals are present at the Huanghe/Yellow River Delta, with only small numbers elsewhere (International Red-crowned Crane Network 2021). Subsequent to this high point, an alarming decline has taken place; estimated totals wintering in China were 737 individuals in 2014-15, 600 in 2016-17, 580 individuals in 2017-18 and only 353 in 2019-20 (International Red-crowned Crane Network, unpublished data).<br/>Accounting for the uncertainty in the past size of the Chinese wintering population through back projection of the counts in 1999-2000 and 2019-20 (Wang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008 and International Red-crowned Crane Network, unpublished data), the rate of decline here is estimated to have been 94.2% over the past three generations (48 years: 1973-2021). This projects that the size of this population was 5,382 individuals in 1973, making it by far the largest wintering population at the time. There is anecdotal information that suggests the population may have been large in the mid-20th century: flocks of more than 100 were reported to be regular at wetland sites destroyed in the 1970s (BirdLife International 2001) that are assumed to be additional to the more than 1,500 counted at Yancheng in the early 1960s (Shi Zerong and&#160;Wu Lingxiang 1987).<br/><br/>Counts of the Korean Peninsula wintering population have increased considerably since the mid-1990s, when 575 were estimated to be present spread across DPR Korea and Republic of Korea (Meine and&#160;Archibald 1996). 1,019 individuals were counted in 2009-10, 1,083 individuals in 2011-12, but recently a rapid increase has occurred, with 1,251 in 2017-18, 1,401 in 2018-19 and 1,669 individuals in 2019-20 (International Red-crowned Crane Network, unpublished data). However, none are believed to have wintered in DPR Korea since 2013-14 at the latest (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019) and within the Republic of Korea, feeding stations have concentrated birds at few sites. As in Japan, the current population is considered to be at or near a maximum that can be supported in the habitat remaining in the area, but likely exceeds that which would be supported by natural food supplies. Consequently it is suspected that the 2019-20 value is a peak number and the population will begin to reduce in next few years.&#160;Using the 1995-96 and the 2019-20 population estimates, but fixing the latter as the value for the assessment year (2021) results in an estimated increase over the past three generations of 606%, while using the 2009-10 count to project the past population gives a 611% increase. However, it is uncertain whether numbers wintering in Korea have been gradually increasing since the 1970s, or whether a larger number were present with only a recent increase, as there are no counts prior to 1994-95. Historic references suggests the species was common in North Korea in the late 19th century (BirdLife International 2001), but there is no further information until the mid-1990s.",Decreasing,"<em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Grus japonensis </span>breeds in south-eastern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Russia</span>, north-east <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mongolia </span>(where it was first recorded in 2003 [O.

Important staging areas include the Liao River Estuary National Nature Reserve (NNR) and the Yellow River Delta NNR (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). The Japanese population is non-migratory and was confined to Hokkaido, but has been expanding its range as numbers have increased: a pair wintered on Kunashiri Island for the first time in 2015-16 (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019). <br/><br/>For the continental population there is evidence of increasing concentration of birds at fewer suitable sites in both breeding areas and in wintering sites (Jiang <em>et al. </em>2012, Wang <em>et al. </em>2020). Breeding census data in the Sanjiang&#160;Plain&#160;shows numbers to be stable between 1984 and 2008, but with&#160;increased concentration to fewer localities due to land use changes (Jiang<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012). Elsewhere the species no longer breeds at Keerqin, Xianghai and Momoge NNRs in China (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019), while in Russia there is concern that there is now insufficient habitat for the species to adjust to medium-term cyclic rainfall patterns (Momose and&#160;Momose 2019).&#160;For wintering birds, in Jiangsu only 6–7 sites out of 28 previously occupied sites were occupied in 2008, estimated to represent only 8% of the occupied range in the 1980s (Su and&#160;Zhou 2012).<br/><br/>The resident population in Japan has increased to c.1,900 birds (<span lang=""EN-US"">Red-crowned Crane Conservancy 2021), but this growth is not expected to continue due to habitat limitations and change in winter feeding methods by the Ministry of the Environment, Japan, to reduce high concentrations of cranes.<p></p>","Individuals and eggs are sold within China (Jim Harris <em>in litt. </em>2012).

Pollution from a sugar cane mill near the town of  Tamazula has made a portion of the former range of the species in the  lower Tamazula River uninhabitable since the 1970’s (Lyons and  Mercado-Silva 2000). Additional pollution from waste water from the town of Tuxpán, and from sewage from a huge paper mill in Atenquique (García 2008), leads to an ongoing decline in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy and quality of habitats. From 1995 to 2016, the species has  been found at about 10 collection sites, several of them moderately large, and recent surveys indicate that probably all of these populations still persist and have been quite stable since the 1980's and 1990's. <br/><br/>Though the best case scenario of the estimated extent of occurence (1,350 km<sup>2</sup>) and area of occupancy (280 km<sup>2</sup>) meets the threshold for Endangered, due to a high number of locations (9&#160; and relatively stable stocks, this species is assessed&#160;Vulnerable.","The Peppered Splitfin&#160;is known to inhabit permanent freshwater rivers in the Río Coahuayana basin in the state of Jalisco and occurs in rocky streams&#160;and riffles over  substrates of sand, rocks and boulders. The vegetation associated to its habitat is typically  green algae, sometimes sparse or asbsent, especially in large rivers where  the species is scarce. The currents are slight or moderate to swift, the  water is turbid or clear. It can be found in depths of 1 m, but usually  it prefers depths of 0.5 m or less.&#160;Like all known&#160;<em>Allodontichthys </em>species, the Peppered Splitfin is a bottom-dwelling and riffle-inhabitating<strong>&#160;</strong>species (Lyons 2011).<br/><br/>Observations of Köck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in March 2016 in the Río Contla about 100 m north of the Highway 110 bridge at Contla, revealed a very shallow habitat with water depths less than 30 cm and a width of 3 to 4 m; in the rainy season the width reaches to about 8m, inferred from the existing pebble shore. The habitat was structured with a few big rocks and boulders in the middle of the current, a lot of gravel of different sizes, mud, sand and silt. There were few patches of submersed vegetation (Characeae) could be seen in the more quiet parts of the creek. The current was mainly swift, the water clear. The water parameters about noon were: pH 7.6, carbonate hardness 3°, total hardness 7°, water temperature 22°C. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, a discharge of polluted water close to the bridge raised the pH to 8.6 and led to the occurence of nitrite (1 mg/l) and nitrate (25 mg/l) that were absent above the discharge pipe.&#160;<em>Allodontichthys tamazulae&#160;</em>was associated with its congener&#160;<em>Allodontichthys hubbsi</em>&#160;(in about the same quantity),&#160;<em>Ilyodon whitei&#160;</em>(dominant species, about 90% of the total number of fish),&#160;<em>Poeclia butleri</em>&#160;and Tilapias (species not determined). The top predator seemed to be Dobsonfly larvae (subfamily Corydalinae, family Corydalidae) of about 10 - 12 cm in length, that could be seen hunting successfully twice in 30 minutes.&#160;<br/><br/>The Río Tamazula east of Tamazula de Giordano has a width of 5 to 10 m with a depth of about 50 cm. The bottom is comprised of big rocks and boulders, gravel, silt, mud and sand. The water in March 2016 was swift to torrential, depending on ground and width, and clear to murky. The water parameters were similar to the ones from the Río Contla. The species was associated with the same fish as in its affluent, and a few&#160;<em>Xenotoca lyonsi </em>were also found. The embankment was comprised by small trees (probably&#160;<em>Salix</em>), reeds and few herbaceous riparian plants; the main sections of the riverbank were free of vegetation. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, viscous remains of burnt sugar cane were found very close by: this would be washed into the river with rain.","<em></em>Water pollution has been identified as main threat for this species. Sewage from a sugar cane mill near the town of Tamazula de Giordano has made a portion of the former range of the species in the lower Tamazula River uninhabitable since the 1970’s (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). Moreover, waste water from a huge paper mill at Atenquique has had a heavilyy negative impact on downstream sections of the Río Tuxpán (García 2008), enhanced by sewage from the town of Tuxpán. Additional threats include wash-in of fertilizers and pesticides from ubiquitous sugar cane fields, in addition to sediment as a result of almost entire deforestation in the headwaters of the Río Atenquique (and other affluents of the Río Tuxpán), along with the Río Tuxpán itself for paper production. It is also threatened by non-native fish species (Tilapias).","From its distribution in two distinct river systems, two subpopulations (the Río El Tule and the Río Tuxpán subopulation) can be inferred. <br/><br/>The Río El Tule subpopulation is probably restricted to the Río El Terrero downstream to sections of this river just below El Pozo Santo and to one of its affluents, the Río La Trampa (Arroyo San José de Tule). Discharges from a sugar cane mill in San José de Tule and sewage from these two towns seem to deteriorate the water quality of this river significantly, making it uninhabitable for this species downstream. Due to its restricted range and declining stocks, this subpopulation is regarded Endangered. <br/><br/>The Río Tuxpán subpopulation was found in the Río Tamazula/Tuxpán system from approximately La Garita downstream to just below Atenquique, encompassing some of its affluents like the ríos Contla and San Grergorio and the arroyos Tecalitlán and Espanatica. This subpopulation is threatened by waste waters from a sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Giordano, making the river section after the town uninhabitable for this species since the 1970's (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). However the species occurred in several surveys by Lyons (1999 - 2010) in the Río Tuxpán, so it seems to persist there though it is scarce (T. Lyons pers. comm. 2018, Köck <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). From most of its affulents, the stocks seem to have remained quite stable since the 1980's and 1990's (Lyons 2011). Taking into consideration the restricted range and population declines in some of the habitats, this subpopulation is regarded Vulnerable.",Decreasing,"The Tuxpán Splitfin is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco, historically widely distributed in the upper sections of the Río Coahuayana (Miller <em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2005), named ríos Tamazula and Tuxpán&#160;(downstream to about the town of San Marcos), and the upper Río El Tule drainage (ríos El Terrero and La Trampa), an affluent of the Río Naranjo, the name of the Río Coahuayana section following the Río Tuxpán. The historical extent of occurrence included several affluents of the ríos Tamazula and Tuxpán, the ríos Contla, San Gregorio (San Jeronimo or Cobianes) and Atenquique, and the arroyos (creeks) Tecalitlán and Espanatica. Due to water pollution caused by sugar cane mills (e.g. Tamazula de Giordano), by sewage from the town of Tuxpán and by a huge paper mill in Atenquique, it is inferred that nowadays the main river is only scarcely populated with this species, and the Río Tamazula past the sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Giordano is thought to be uninhabitable (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). However, it still inhabits the listed affluents and the Río Tamazula above the sugar cane mill; in total, it is known from about 10 collection sites.

Furthermore, within- and between-year dispersal distances are generally short (&lt;5 km), suggesting that local scale conservation of prairie dogs may be important (Skrade and Dinsmore 2010). Over 70% of nests on cultivated land are destroyed by farm machinery (Shackford <em>et al.</em> 1999), although Dreitz and Knopf (2007) suggest that nest success is comparable between cultivated land and grasslands - instead the cause of nest failure is different between the two habitat types.

Trends in Russia are less clear, but it is likely that overall the species is undergoing rapid declines over three generations, and it is therefore listed as Vulnerable. Precise drivers of declines are unclear, but likely include habitat modification, predation, egg harvesting and human disturbance.","This species is found over the waters of the Arctic and subarctic coastal plains. It feeds mainly on small fish which it catches by surface-dipping. Laying mainly occurs in June, usually in small monospecific colonies on a variety of habitats up to 20 km inland (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).","<p>No single main driver of declines has been identified but several factors including habitat degradation, predation, egg harvesting and disturbance by humans likely play a substantial role in population change at local scales, and may have a cumulative impact at the population level.&#160;Eggs and chicks are reportedly depredated by introduced species such as Arctic Fox&#160;<em>Vulpes lagopus</em>&#160;and Red Fox&#160;<em>V. vulpes,</em>&#160;Brown Rats <em>Rattus norvegicus</em>, and domestic dogs. Natural predators include American Mink <em>Mustela vison</em>, bears <em>Ursus</em> spp. and a variety of bird species. Some chicks may also be killed by Arctic Terns <em>Sterna paradisaea&#160;</em>(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006), however breeding success in the species is lower in the absence of Arctic Terns as they benefit from their aggressive colony defence. Aleutian Terns are very sensitive to disturbance at colonies&#160;and may&#160;seasonally or even permanently abandon colonies in response to human disturbance (Gochfield&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Complete colony abandonment has been observed following a single visit by humans (Haney<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1991).<br/><br/>Widespread declines across a coastline as large as Alaska’s suggest that declines are not strictly caused by local factors. Shifts in prey distribution due to climate change impacts may be having a particular impact on the species at a large scale. Within a mixed colony, provisioning rates of Arctic Terns were found to be higher than for Aleutian Terns (Gochfield <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), implying a divergence in preferred prey availability. The cause of this prey limitation may be highly relevant to the declines in the species: it may be that ongoing shifts in the marine habitat have particularly negative consequences for this species.<br/><br/>It is also possible that threats that are yet to be determined are acting on the species along its migratory route and in the wintering areas, which are particularly poorly known&#160;(M.

Partners in Flight (2019) placed the number of mature individuals at 22,000 based on 2015 estimates however, a subsequent range-wide assessment of population and trends estimated a minimum worldwide breeding population of 31,131 birds across 202 colonies, with 18% (5,529 birds in 110 colonies) in Alaska and 82% (25,602 birds in 92 colonies) in Russia (Renner <em>et al</em>. 2015). It does not account for colonies that have not been surveyed in recent years or for the fact that the surveys conducted were neither systematic nor inclusive of all potential habitats (Renner <em>et al</em>. 2015) and thus the total population may be higher.

Increased variation in water levels along the rivers on which it breeds due to dams, irrigation and sand mining leads to both flooding of colonies and low water levels that allow access to terrestrial predators and people onto breeding islands. Both situations result in high egg and chick mortality, and the rate of reproduction does not appear to be sufficient to maintain the population. Declines have been continuing for many decades in this previously common and distinctive bird. The species has been lost as a breeding bird from all of South East Asia, Myanmar and probably now also Pakistan. The recent and future rate of population reduction is thus estimated at 34-46% over three generations.<p></p>","It occurs primarily on larger, sandy, lowland rivers, around lakes and adjacent marshes and, in the non-breeding season, estuaries and coasts. It breeds colonially on large, exposed sand-bars and islands, requiring water levels to drop sufficiently to expose the islands and not threaten flooding the nest but not to drop so far as to allow land-based predators access to the colonies (Debata <em>et al. </em>2019, Shaikh <em>et al. </em>2019, Shaikh 2020).<br/><br/>Birds return to colonies from February onwards, dependent on water levels. In Odisha, the peak egg-laying period is in April, median clutch size is three (between one and five) and the mean incubation period is 22 days (Debata <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;Birds had departed the colony by August (Debata <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;<br/><br/>Nesting success is currently very low. In the National Chambal Sanctuary only&#160;43% of eggs survived to hatching and 35% of chicks then survived to fledging, due to very high rates of egg and chick mortality (Shaikh 2020). In Odisha 61% of nests produced chicks, with only 31% of these chicks surviving to fledging (Debata <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;<br/><br/>A large proportion of the global population appears to move to coastal areas after breeding, with the largest numbers observed as they gather prior to returning upriver. The remaining individuals may remain on breeding rivers or within the connected river network nearby, or may wander widely in the non-breeding season. Resightings of marked individuals from Chambal have been made on the coast in Gujarat, along the Ganges at Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh) and at Kakinada, (Andhra Pradesh), suggesting that movements to non-breeding areas of over 1,000 km are not atypical (Shaikh 2020). The critical factor is water level, as the species requires extensive shallows to forage successfully. High water levels will see birds travel large distances to find suitable feeding areas: a pair has been recorded at the southernmost point of mainland India (S. Balachandran <em>in litt. </em>2020) and there is a record of a vagrant from Oman (Oman Bird Records Database 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In winter birds congregate in areas with extensive mudflats and in some areas saltpans, regularly using offshore sandbars and islands to roost.","<p>Its decline is attributable to widespread increases in human disturbance, exploitation and degradation of rivers and lakes through irrigation schemes, transportation, domestic use, and pollution from agricultural and industrial chemicals. A critical factor is the increasing variation in water level within breeding areas due to greater control of, and demand for water resources. As the species is sensitive to both flooding and to terrestrial predators, any change in water regime is negative for the species. <br/><br/>The population stronghold at National Chambal Sanctuary, India has been badly affected by the damming of the Chambal River in upstream and several existing lift irrigation plants throughout the river resulting in dropping water levels. Low water level and flow rates connects the nesting sandbars to bank, resulting in predation by free-ranging dogs, jackals and trampling by cattle (Shaikh <em>et al.</em> 2018; Shaikh &amp; Mendis 2019, Shaikh 2020).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Throughout the breeding range low water levels increase the likelihood and severity of disturbance and opportunistic egg and chick harvesting by people (Debata&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019,&#160;Kabir&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Shaikh 2020).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Greater human presence alongside colonies encourages commensal predators, most seriously feral dogs, but also&#160;House Crows&#160;<em>Corvus splendens</em>, which have been noted to cause almost complete breeding failure of one colony in one season (Siddiqui&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">The River Ganga is additionally under pressure from human use of the river for religious gatherings, overfishing and pollution from the major cities of north India (<a>A.

Additional disturbance by bird photographers may also pose a threat to certain colonies if they are repeatedly visited (Kabir <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;</p>  In the non-breeding areas in Bangladesh, land reclamation (including small scale but persistent reclamation for agricultural land), cross dam construction along the Meghna Estuary, oil spill, mangrove plantation and sea level rise were listed as the most serious and irreversible threats to coastal wetlands (Chowdhury <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;      <p></p>","The population is estimated at 2,450-2,900 mature individuals, based on the compilation of counts and expert estimates from across the species's range (Chowdhury <em>et al. </em>2020, Shaikh 2020, S.U. Chowdhury, D.K. Das, S. Debata, S. Mohsanin, T. Munkur,&#160;P. Shaikh, C Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Much of the research into the status of the species was collated during the Riverine birds of the Central Asian Flyway&#160;workshop in November 2019. <br/><br/>The revised estimate is based on numbers recorded during the non-breeding season, when a majority of the population occurs in a few large groups at regular sites. The largest numbers recorded in recent decades have been from the Meghna-Padma delta in Bangladesh, where a total of 3,108 individuals were counted at Nijhum Dwip in February 2020 (D.K. Das <em>in litt. </em>2020). This is&#160;the highest count since 2001, when 5,400 individuals were recorded from the same area (Li <em>et al. </em>2009). This 2020 count is considerably higher than the previous counts conducted in the area in the 2019/20 season (and for many years), it presumably includes birds noted earlier from Chittagong (Chowdhury <em>et al. </em>2020) plus any wintering birds unseen in the area. As such it is likely to represent a count close to the total number wintering in Bangladesh.&#160;<br/><br/>In India, most observations during the non-breeding season are of few birds but larger congregations are known from a handful of key sites. To the far west of the range&#160;&#160;<em>c.&#160;</em>150 are regularly recorded from&#160;Jamnagar in Gujarat (eBird 2020, Shaikh 2020),&#160; centrally&#160;<em>c. </em>100-300 remain on the Yamuna and Ganges rivers (Shaikh 2020), while on the east coast between 200 and 400 have been recorded&#160;at Satkosia on the River Mahanadi in Odisha (Debata <em>et al. </em>2019, S. Debata <em>in litt. </em>2020) and around 120 at Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh (eBird 2020, Wetlands International South Asia 2020). Individuals or very small numbers may occur almost anywhere around the coast (for example, recorded in 2018 at&#160;Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of mainland India&#160;[S. Balachandran <em>in litt. </em>2020])&#160;and wander widely in central India during the non-breeding season (eBird 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>The population in Pakistan is now thought to be very small: 15 birds were found in surveys of Badin province in 2018 (Ali <em>et al. </em>2018), close to and possibly connected with those wintering in Gujarat. One bird was observed in the Gulf of Mottama, Myanmar in 2018 (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), but it does not seem likely that there is still a regular wintering population in Myanmar.&#160;The last regular known wintering group, near Sittwe, numbered 27 in 2008 fell to 9 in 2012, and none have been recorded since (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).<br/><br/>On the basis of these numbers at wintering sites, the total population in 2020 is estimated at between 3,700 and 4,400 individuals, roughly equating to 2,450-2,900 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Present breeding records are from National Chambal Sanctuary, around 500 adults (Shaikh and Mendis 2019, Singh and Sharma 2018), River Mahanadi, 188-224 adults (Debata&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019), Son Gharial Sanctuary, 50 adults (P. Shaikh&#160;<em>in litt</em>&#160;2019), River Ganga, 450 adults (A. Kumar.&#160;<em>in</em>&#160;<em>litt</em>&#160;2019)&#160;<a>and Turtle Wildlife Sanctuary, 13 adults (five pairs) (Mital <em>et al. </em>2019).</a>&#160;Four pairs bred at Pong Dam in 2006, but no nesting has occurred there recently (Fernandes and Besten 2013, S. Balachandran <em>in litt. </em>2020). The only other confirmed nesting in recent years has been in Bangladesh, where&#160;<a>45 individuals were observed at Chapai Nawabganj, Rajshahi division on 24 April 2016 and three nests subsequently located on 23 May 2016 (Kabir&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;</a><br/><br/>A small number may still breed in Pakistan, but there are no recent breeding records in the upper Indus plains and just two recent records of spring birds seem likely to have involved birds on passage, possibly to breeding sites in India (Z.A. Shaikh&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;<br/><br/>As such the known breeding population is 1,204-1,280 mature individuals, lower than wintering numbers. This suggests there are additional breeding colonies to locate, and perhaps that a proportion of the mature population are not breeding in any particular year. When it is thought that the number of breeding individuals is reasonably well-known, such a discrepancy in breeding and wintering estimates can be a cause of concern, as it may indicate a severe restriction on breeding sites and hence a lower effective population size.<br/><br/>There are no confirmed records of breeding in Myanmar for over 80 years (C Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020), but loss of the species from the country is likely to have occurred more recently. In south-east Asia the species has not been recorded many decades: in Lao PDR the last documented records are from 1929 (BirdLife 2001). In Cambodia the last record was made between 1950 and 1964, likely in 1960 or 1961 (Thomas and Poole 2003) when 6 birds were observed in Phnom Penh, at the confluence of the Tonle Sap, Mekong and Bassac Rivers (Thomas 1964, BirdLife International 2001). The last Viet Nam records are also from the 19th century (BirdLife International 2001).",Decreasing,"Indian Skimmer&#160;<em>Rynchops albicollis</em>&#160;is now almost completely restricted to <strong>India </strong>as a breeding bird, with only occasional breeding in western&#160;<strong>Bangladesh </strong>(Kabir&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The recent population decline has been accompanied by a range contraction and there are no recent confirmed breeding records from&#160;<strong>Pakistan</strong>&#160;or&#160;<strong>Myanmar</strong>. <br/><br/>It was formerly widely distributed across the Indian Subcontinent, along the major rivers of Myanmar and along the Mekong in Indo-China. It was common in the 19th century in Myanmar, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam, but there are very few recent records from Myanmar&#160;and none from Lao PDR, Cambodia or Viet Nam, where the species is considered to be extinct.&#160;In Pakistan it was already rare by the 1990s (Roberts 1991) but in recent years there have been very few records; brief spring migrants in the northern Indus floodplain (Z. A. Shaikh&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).&#160; In Myanmar&#160;there are only very few records of single birds in recent years along&#160;the&#160;Ayeyarwady&#160;River&#160;and it is decades since confirmed breeding records (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020, C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).<br/><br/>A large proportion of the global population winters in the Padma-Meghna delta in Bangladesh (Mohsanin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Chowdhury <em>et al. </em>2020, S. Mohsanin <em>in litt. </em>2020, D. K. Das <em>in litt. </em>2020). Almost all of the remainder remain in India, either along major rivers and reservoirs or at the coast, particularly Gujarat (eBird 2020).&#160;Individuals have been recorded wandering as far as the very southern tip of India at Kanyakumari (S. Balachandran <em>in litt. </em>2020). A very few may also still winter in Myanmar as occasional single individuals have been seen in the Gulf of Mottama (Chowdhury&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020,&#160;eBird 2020).&#160;However a&#160;group near Sittwe numbering 27 in 2008 (Zöckler&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014)&#160;have not been observed since 2012 (C. Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;To the west of the range a few still winter in Pakistan,&#160;close to the border with Gujarat in Badin district (Ali&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). It is now a very rare non-breeding visitor to&#160;<strong>Nepal </strong>(Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016), and indeed even to the north-eastern states of India (A. Choudhury <em>in litt. </em>2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In India the species remains widely distributed, but breeding areas are now highly restricted. Most colonies now occur along the Rivers Chambal, Ganges, Yamuna, Mahanadi and Son (eBird 2020, Debata <em>et al. </em>2019, Dilawar and Shama 2016, Mital <em>et al. </em>2019,&#160;Rajguru&#160;2017, Shaikh <em>et al. </em>2018, Shaikh and Mendis 2019, T. K. Roy <em>in litt. </em>2020), with additional breeding records from Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh (Fernandes and Besten 2013) and the Tawa Reservoir in Madhya Pradesh.

Forest areas with multiple canopy layers and high moss abundance are strongly preferred. Research in British Columbia shows that in areas where forest habitat is relatively plentiful the species seldom re-use the same trees as nest sites, whereas in areas where logging has reduced old-growth there is a higher proportion of nest tree re-use (Burger <em>et al. </em>2009). The species has been shown to suffer increased predation and disturbance at forest edges adjacent to recently cleared areas, compared with forest edges adjacent to regenerating or riparian areas (Malt and Lank 2009). Multiple radar and modelling studies have shown a significant correlation between numbers of birds entering watersheds and the areas of suitable forest habitat within those watersheds (Burger 2002, Burger <em>et al. </em>2004, Raphael <em>et al.</em> 2011). Breeding is mid-March to early September in California, but more compressed further north (Hamer and Nelson 1995a, b, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002). The diet is sandlance, herring, other small schooling fish and, in winter, invertebrates (Gaston and Jones 1998, Piatt <em>et al. </em>2006). Chicks are generally fed large subadult or adult prey rather than juveniles or larvae (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006). It feeds in near-shore habitats up to 1.4 km offshore, in sheltered waters, lagoons and sometimes inland lakes (Carter 1986, Hunt 1995, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002, Hebert and Golightly 2008). The effect of marine attributes on murrelet productivity varies from increasing density and productivity estimates with increasing sea surface temperature in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington (1995-2007; Raphael and Bloxton 2008), to decreasing reproductive efforts with warmer sea-surface temperatures in California (Bigger and Chinnici 2008). Sea-surface temperatures and other marine attributes explained little of the variation in murrelet distribution and abundance compared to the amount and cohesion of forest nesting habitat (Raphael <em>et al.</em> 2015). Daily movements to feeding areas can be up to 250 km in exceptional cases (Whitworth <em>et al. </em>2000), but are normally about 30 km (Burger 2002, Piatt <em>et al. </em>2006). Radio-marked birds from Redwood Creek in North California moved a maximum average distance of 99 km alongshore, with males travelling further than females, and non-breeding males travelling further than breeding males, perhaps in search of mates or nesting habitats. Average home range size was 505 km<sup>2</sup>, again being greater for males than females (Hebert and Golightly 2008). Individuals exhibit plasticity in their foraging behaviour, foraging closer to shore and increasing dive rates during nesting (Peery <em>et al</em>. 2009). Marbled Murrelets most often forage in pairs (Piatt <em>et al. </em>2006). Individuals in the northern part of its range may travel south during the non-breeding season, a movement which likely reflects the availability of prey (Piatt <em>et al. </em>2006).</p>","<p>Loss of nesting habitat is strongly linked to population decline through most of the species’s range (Burger 2002, Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006, Burger and Waterhouse 2009). The massive (85–90%) reduction in old-growth forest (nesting habitat) in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia due to logging likely drove the decline and fragmentation of Murrelet populations in these regions (Sealy and Carter 1984, Rodway <em>et al.</em> 1992, Stein and Miller 1992). Forest loss and fragmentation continues, with the area of 'higher-suitability' habitat declining by 12% between 1993 and 2012 (c.18% in three generations), most of which occurred on non-federal land (Falxa and Raphael 2016). In accordance, Long <em>et al.</em> (2011) estimated that suitable nesting habitat declined by 20-22% between 1978 and 2008 in British Columbia. Multiple radar studies have shown that when breeding habitat is reduced by logging, the birds do not show ability to relocate to remaining forest patches in higher densities, but instead suffer population declines (Burger 2001, Burger <em>et al. </em>2004, Raphael <em>et al. </em>2006), and there is strong support for habitat loss due to logging being the primary driving mechanism for the population decline (Burger 2002). A linked threat is the elevated predation pressures at range margins. Murrelet distribution and abundance is directly correlated to the amount and cohesion of forest nesting habitat (Raphael <em>et al.</em> 2015) and the species has been found to suffer increased corvid (jays and ravens) predation and disturbance at forest edges adjacent to recently cleared areas (Burger 2002, Malt and Lank 2009). Other experiments found that the rate of predation of artificial nests on the Olympic Peninsula was significantly correlated with corvid abundance (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p>In addition, the species is at risk from interaction with commercial fisheries, and changes in prey availability caused by the combined effects of overharvesting and climate change. In 1990, an estimated 1,468 seabirds were killed in fishing nets, 97% of which were Murrelets. Murrelet mortality was strongly associated with gill-net mortality off the Washington coast and some 3300 (2940 adult) Murrelets may drown in fish nets annually throughout their range in Alaska. Assuming a population size of 280,000 individuals, of which 70% are adult breeders, then as much as 1.5% of adult mortality may derive from bycatch. And yet, this estimate does not include mortality in set nets, pound nets or seine nets (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Intense exploitation of prey species during the last century have contributed to depleting the Murrelet’s preferred food resources, causing a shift to lower-trophic-level food items (i.e. krill, sandlance and rockfishes), which appears to have been partly responsible for poor Murrelet reproduction. The decrease in trophic level was most pronounced in pre-breeding diets, which plays a crucial role in alcid life history (Becker and Bessinger 2006). Since the collapse of the Pacific sardine populations, prey quality and abundance has declined, with lower trophic-level prey (e.g. krill) now dominating the pre-breeding diet in California (Becker and Bessinger 2006). This has resulted in a lower proportion of individuals reaching breeding condition, and therefore lower population productivity.</p><p>Climate change is likely exacerbating the reductions in food availability, through changes in sea water temperatures, composition of marine fish communities, and reduced overall fish biomass with dramatic consequences in the diet and population ecology of higher vertebrates that depend on those fish populations (Piatt and Anderson, in press). Occurrence of the species on the San Juan Islands, Washington is positively correlated with winter El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices suggesting that species are required to use the area as a refuge due to concurrent declines in prey availability along the outer Pacific Coast in ENSO years (Lorenz and Raphael 2018). Unlike short-term phenomena, such as ENSO events, the predicted long-term shifts due to climate change represent a more pervasive and persistent change in the ecosystem and can potentially have long-term effects on Alaskan Murrelet populations (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Miller <em>et al.</em> (2012) attributed the 2000-2010 population decline to changes in the marine environment causing reduced availability or quality of prey (among other factors), and juvenile recruitment off Vancouver Island was significantly reduced in a year of low marine productivity and prey availability (Ronconi and Burger 2008). Climate change may also result in changes to the distribution of the coniferous forests required for nesting by the Murrelets (DellaSala <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>Mortality due to oil pollution represents another major threat to Marbled Murrelet populations. Past spills (e.g. Apex Houston, Exxon Valdez, Nestucca and New Carissa) have cause considerable mortality in affected colonies (Piatt and Naslund 1995, Nelson 1997, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002, Titmus and Smith 2008). The 1989 Exxon Valdez event killed an estimated 8,400 Marbled Murrelets (c.3% of the Alaskan population) and the toll from chronic pollution is unknown (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Future oil spills will continue to threaten the viability of small, declining populations, especially in California, Oregon and Washington where a single large spill could potentially extirpate an entire population (Carter and Kuletz 1995). There is also strong potential for direct interaction between the species and tanker traffic along the proposed ""Northern Gateway"" tanker traffic routes (Bertram <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>        </p><p>Owing to their coastal distribution and use of relatively sheltered marine habitats, Murrelets are more exposed to vessel activities than most other seabirds in the region. Human disturbance can disrupt foraging birds and persistent boat traffic may displace birds from important foraging areas. Carter and Kuletz (1995) found that Murrelet numbers were negatively correlated with numbers of boats and low-flying aircrafts, and presented suggestive evidence that human disturbance and traffic caused disruptions to breeding.</p><p></p>","<p>COSEWIC (2012) estimated the total population to number 358,200-417,500 individuals, rounded here to 350,000-420,000 individuals, based on 271,000 individuals in Alaska (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2007), 72,600-125,600 in British Columbia (Bertram <em>et al.</em> 2007), and 15,400-23,900 individuals in Washington, Oregon and California (Falxa <em>et al.</em> 2014, Falxa and Raphael 2016). This range equates to 238,800-278,300 mature individuals, rounded here to 240,000-280,000.

In Alaska (70% of the population), historical estimates place the population at c. 750,000 individuals, though when trend estimates are applied to this figure it gives an estimated 2006 population of c. 271,000 individuals (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2007). The British Columbia population was previously thought to be c. 54,000 - 92,500 (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006) but extrapolations from recent radar counts suggest the population may in fact be c. 72,600-125,600 birds (COSEWIC 2012). This higher estimate is likely due to differences in survey methodology as opposed to a genuine population increase. The population in Washington, Oregon and California is estimated at 15,400-23,900 individuals (Falxa <em>et al.</em> 2014, Falxa and Raphael 2016).&#160;The greatest historical decreases have occurred in Washington, Oregon and California (A. Burger<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2012, Falxa and Raphael 2016). Declines are also reported in British Columbia and south-east Alaska (Perry 1995). Trend analyses conducted during 2000-2013 suggest a decline of c.11% over the period in Washington, Oregon and California (Falxa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Falxa and Raphael 2016), and a decrease of c.70% in Alaska from the 1980s to 2006 (Piatt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). At-sea surveys over the past 25 years in British Columbia suggest declines of c.1% per year (Piatt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006), although radar surveys suggest the population may have been relatively stable since 1999 with declines in some regions of British Columbia (COSEWIC 2012, Bertram&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Availability of nesting habitat in British Columbia, which is strongly correlated with local breeding populations (Burger 2001, Burger&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004), has declined by 22%&#160; between&#160; 1978 and 2008, and is continuing (COSEWIC 2012).&#160;</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/> It is Threatened in all range states and provinces except Alaska.

In Canada there has been extensive research, an updated recovery strategy (Environment Canada 2014), some (relatively minor) habitat protection under the British Columbia Forest and Range Practices Act, more extensive protection of forest habitat under various Land Use agreements and a radar monitoring plan developed by the Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team (CMMRT 2003, COSEWIC 2012). The Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team developed a Recovery Strategy to be compliant with the Canadian Species at Risk Act (Environment Canada 2014). This lays out the general strategy for population stability (population reduction between 2002 and 2032 not to exceed 30% of the 2002 population and this decline is linked to similar limited decline in available suitable nesting habitat). The essential Marine and Terrestrial Action Plans required by the Species at Risk Act have not been drafted (as of 2016) and these are not likely to be completed and implemented before 2020. Under the Canadian Recovery Strategy critical nesting habitat requiring protection is defined as 70% of the 2002 suitable nesting habitat coast-wide, with varying percentages (68-90%) in the six conservation regions in British Columbia (Environment Canada 2014).</p>  <p>The U.S. Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) began developing a Marbled Murrelet Long-Term Conservation Strategy in 2007 (Escene 2007); the final strategy still has not been released as of 2016. The Northwest Forest Plan (1994) is expected to ensure the protection of a large proportion of important habitats in the USA (Raphael 2006).</p>  <p>Extensive areas of suitable forest nesting habitat have been set aside in conservancies on the northern and central mainland and in Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands) (COSEWIC 2012). Smaller areas are being protected by other forestry and conservation measures. Overall, an estimated 35% of the 1,826,828 hectares of&#160; suitable habitat in all of British Columbia (based on the Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team modeling criteria [CMMRT 2003]) had been protected under various measures by 2011 (COSEWIC 2012). In 1998, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council protected 179 km<sup>2</sup> of Afognak Island (<em>BBC Wildlife</em> 1999 172: 23). In 2007, 1,569 ha of forested land on the Oregon Coast was acquired under conservation easement for the species (amongst others), part funded by the New Carissa oil-spill funds (Escene 2007). Between 1998 and 2002, 507 Marbled Murrelets were radio-tracked in British Columbia (<span lang=""EN-US"">Zharikov <em>et al. </em>2007), during 2005-2007, 111 birds were radio-tracked at Port Snettisham, Alaska (Nelson <em>et al</em>. 2008), and between 2004-2008, 157 birds were radio-tagged on Olympic Peninsula, Washington to determine nesting habitat, activity patterns and distribution. A recommended protocol for surveying the species in forests was published in 2003 by PSG (Mack <em>et al. </em>2003). In British Columbia standard protocols have been developed for various survey methods (RISC 2001, Manley 2006). Research has shown that habitat management at relatively fine scales may provide conservation benefits (Horton 2008) and that the species would benefit from a reduction in the amount of hard edges (recent clear-cuts) at both patch and landscape scales (Malt and Lank 2009).<br/> <br/> <strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/> Survey potential nesting habitat on all ownerships and protect all occupied sites. Collect data on the ratio of juvenile to adult birds from sites throughout the range, and monitor over time, as this is thought to be a reliable indicator of productivity (Peery <em>et al.</em> 2007). Research means of improving the abundance of high quality food, e.g. small fish, during the pre-breeding period. Minimise damage to fish stocks and feeding areas (RENEW Report 1999 9: 20). Conduct research on the behaviour of migrants to determine the extent to which dispersal results in gene flow and prevents declines in resident populations (Peery <em>et al.</em> 2010). Complete and implement the SARA-compliant Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Action Plans needed to implement the Canadian Recovery Strategy (Environment Canada 2014). Protect both terrestrial nesting habitat and marine habitat throughout the species's range (Lorenz <em>et al</em>. 2016), create larger blocks of habitat, provide buffers and other means for minimizing edge effects and predation (K. J. Kuletz <em>in litt.</em> 1999, USFWS 2012). Renew the radar monitoring at British Columbia watersheds (Bertram <em>et al.</em> 2015), in order to track population trends and determine the effects of habitat removal (logging) and local changes in marine conditions. Move campgrounds away from old-growth areas in Californian State Parks, in order to reduce predator populations in breeding areas. Reduce oil-spills, gill-net mortality and logging (K. J. Kuletz <em>in litt.</em> 1999). List as Threatened in Alaska (K. J. Kuletz <em>in litt.</em> 1999).</p><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Predator eradication is currently ongoing however and if a population recovery is evidenced, this species may qualify for downlisting to a lower threat category. Similarly, if the species is confirmed to be breeding at more than 10 locations, downlisting may also be warranted. Until such confirmation however, the species is precautionarily retained as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p> <p></p>","It nests on steep sea-slopes, canyons and cliffs with a sparse cover of herbaceous and shrubby plants (Drost and Lewis 1995)<strong></strong>. It is a generalist predator and may exploit higher prey concentrations around pelagic convergence lines (Hamilton <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. Around Santa Barbara, it feeds on larval fish, especially Northern Anchovy <em>Engraulis mordax</em><strong> </strong>(Hunt and Butler 1980, Hunt <em>et al.</em> 1981). Breeding effort and performance are lower when anchovy abundance is low (Hunt and Butler 1980)<strong></strong>. Adults enter and leave the nesting colonies at night when there is little or no moon, typically arriving on the Channel Islands in mid-February. Nesting persists through mid-June with peak nesting from late March to late April (Jones <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2005). Clutches consist of two eggs laid approximately eight days apart with replacement of lost clutches unusual. Incubation takes c.34 days (Jones<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005). There are no recent records of them breeding under shrubs on top of Anacapa Island, a habitat used frequently on nearby, rat-free, Santa Barbara Island (Jones <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2005).<p></p>","<p>Invasive mammals were responsible for all known and suspected colony extinctions in the past and pose an ongoing threat by being present in all the larger colonies and former colonies (McChesney and Tershy 1998). Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> depredate chicks and adults. Heavy cat predation was recorded on North Coronado until the mid-1990s (Jehl and Bond 1975, Drost and Lewis 1995). The cat population at Catalina was most recently estimated at 600-750 individuals (Guttila and Stapp 2010) and eradication of cats and rats on the island has been regarded as ‘not currently feasible’ (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2014). Despite this however, many introduced predators have been removed from a number of breeding islands in recent decades (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Keitt 2005, Birt <em>et al</em>. 2012) with post-eradication increases noted (Whitworth and Carter 2017); the eradication of cats on some islands off the coast of western Baja California (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San Martín and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities (Whitworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> prey on murrelet eggs and adults (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2014). Eradication of rats at Anacapa Island in 2001–2002 greatly improved murrelet hatching success in the following years (2003–2010) (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2013), with 191% more eggs hatching and 94% fewer nests being depredated (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2016). Hatching success remains very low on islands including St. Clementine however, a result of ongoing predation by foxes and black rats (Whitworth <em>et al</em>. 2018). House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> were recently introduced to the Coronados Islands, and Deer Mice&#160;<em>Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae</em> (native to nearby Cedros Island) have also been introduced to the San Benito Islands. Deer Mice depredated 46% of all monitored eggs on Santa Barbara (Murray <em>et al</em>. 1983), which is the largest known breeding site for the species (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, on Anacapa, Deer Mice were established long before the introduction of rats, precluding them from consideration as the cause of declines there (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Another problematic native species is the Barn Owl <em>Tyto alba</em>. Annual estimates of owl predation on Santa Barbara range from 11 to 172 individuals (Thomsen and Harvey 2012, Thomsen <em>et al</em>. 2013, Nur <em>et al</em>. 2013). Population growth modelling based on data collected between 1991 and 2010, resulted in an estimate of a 1.17% population decline owing to owl predation, and projections of a hypothetical 50-80% reduction in predation pressure could potentially result in a 1.15-2.54% positive growth rate, barring an increase in egg depredation from island mouse populations (Nur <em>et al</em>. 2013). This assessment implicated the role of Barn Owls in the suppression of the Scripps’s Murrelet population recovery on Santa Barbara Island although recent evidence suggests that the presence of Barn Owls on Santa Barbara may have an indirect <em>positive</em>&#160;influence on Murrelet egg survival through increased predation on deer mice, and resultantly reduced egg predation from the mice themselves (Thomsen and Green 2016). Such interactions however, have been shown to shift with changing&#160;El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rainfall conditions as changing rainfall, vegetation abundance and resultantly deer mouse populations can result in 15-fold increases in the predation of Murrelet by Owls in the absence of mice as a food source (Thomsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). It has recently been evidenced that fecundity is dramatically reduced during drought years due to enhanced egg predation by deer mice and population declines may result (Thomsen and Green 2019). Any increase in the frequency or severity of drought conditions will likely increase the rate of population decline in response.</p>  <p>Various forms of pollution are threatening the species. The potential impacts of large and small oil spills in congregation waters near breeding islands is of great concern (Carter <em>et al</em>. 2000, Burkett <em>et al</em>. 2003). Long Beach Harbour is the largest oil port in western North America, with daily arrivals and departures of large oil tankers (USFWS 2005). Frequent oil spills occur in the vicinity of Long Beach Harbour, but most have not affected waters near Catalina (Carter 2003, Whitworth <em>et al</em>. 2014). As stated by Drost and Lewis (1995), pollution from offshore oil-wells or the Los Angeles oil-tanker lane could potentially extirpate the species from the south California Bight. Organochlorine pollutants are considered not to have a current significant effect on murrelets breeding at Catalina, but may have caused reduced reproduction or population size in the past, especially between the 1940s and 1970s, prior to the end of production and dumping of DDT in southern California waters (Drost and Lewis 1995, Whitworth <em>et al</em>. 2014). The potential impacts of bright lights used by squid fishing boats near breeding colonies is another concern, potentially causing disorientation and elevated predation pressures. Many owl-predated murrelets were found during a period of intense inshore squid fishing around Santa Catalina and disturbance from related activities could discourage nest-visitation and possibly cause collision mortalities (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>Human disturbance has been identified as a cause of nest abandonment and a major threat to the species (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). The two highest rates of abandonment on record were observed at the Dock and the Bunkhouse plots, which are directly associated with human structures. The human disturbance associated with these sites may also affect the remaining nesting birds. Machinery operations at the dock include high decibel engine noise and vibration of the dock structure, which along with frequent traffic, could be affecting nesting murrelets beneath the decking of these structures (Howard <em><em>et al</em>.</em> 2015).</p><p>Extreme fluctuations of sea surface temperature related to ENSO, are likely to affect food availability for the species, though the impact of such events appears to be small due to their generalist prey (USFWS 2016). In addition, the species's foraging behaviour puts it at risk from gill-net fisheries, although very few incidences have been reported (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2000). No mortality has been reported in nearshore gill-net fisheries in which other seabirds have relatively high bycatch rates (Pacific Seabird Group undated). However, the white seabass gill-net fishery operating around the northern California Channel Islands has very little observer coverage, potentially indicating that bycatch incidence has been underestimated or completely overlooked (Pacific Seabird Group undated).</p><p></p>","Birt <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimate the total number of breeding pairs to be in excess of 6,500, which equated to 13,000 mature individuals. Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population at 15,000, hence it is placed here in the band for 10,000-19,999 mature individuals, assumed to equate to 15,000-30,000 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"<em>Synthliboramphus scrippsi</em> breeds on islands off southern California, <strong>U.S.A.</strong> (San  Miguel, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Barbara, San Clemente, and, formerly,  Santa Catalina) and western Baja California, <strong>Mexico</strong> (San Benito, Todos Santos and the  Coronado and San Jerónimo islands) (Chesser <em>et al</em>. 2012, Whitworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). On  large islands, the species is confined largely or entirely to offshore  rocks (Drost and Lewis 1995). Breeding on San Martín and Cedros Islands,  Baja California, is less certain but presumed present (Chesser <em>et al</em>. 2012, Whitworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). In the U.S.A., an estimated 885-2,575 breeding pairs occur, the biggest colony on the island of Santa Barbara holds 500-1,250 pairs (B. Keitt and D. Whitworth <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Small numbers breed on Anacapa (200-600 pairs), Santa Cruz (100-300 pairs), San Miguel (50-300 pairs), and San Clemente islands (10-50 pairs), U.S.A. (Sowls <em>et al.</em> 1980, Hunt <em>et al.</em> 1981, Carter <em>et al.</em> 1992, Drost and Lewis 1995)<strong></strong>. The Santa Barbara colony has been stable since the 1980s, but may have declined since the turn of the century (B. Keitt and D. Whitworth <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. The breeding population size on the islands off western Baja California was estimated between 2002-2008 at 1686-4428 pairs, and despite likely being extirpated on all islands excluding Coronado and San Benito in the past (Bedolla-Guzmán <em>et al</em>. 2019), it has returned to breed at all such locations. Numbers are estimated to include 1117-2933 pairs at Isla Coronado, 262-688 at Todos Santos, 19-49 at San&#160;Martín, 24-64 at San Jerónimo, 231-607 at San Benito and 33-87 on the Cedros Islands (Whitworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). The eradication of cats on some such islands (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San Martín and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities. The species winters offshore from northern California (rarely) south to southern Baja California (Chesser <em>et al</em>. 2012).

In parts of the range, the species was found to be recovering due to intense conservation action.<br/><p></p>","The species inhabits fire-sustained open pine-forest, dominated in half of its range by longleaf pine <em>Pinus palustris</em> and elsewhere by shortleaf <em>P. echinata</em>, slash <em>P. elliotti</em>, or loblolly <em>P. taeda</em> pines (J. A. Jackson <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is a cooperative breeder, with each group requiring at least 80 ha of habitat (Walters <em>et al. </em>1988, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). Nesting trees appear to be selected on the rate and duration of fresh resin production, utilised by the birds to protect their nest holes from arboreal predators, such as climbing rat snakes&#160;<em>Elaphe obsoleta&#160;</em>(Jackson 1994). The selected tree also needs a sufficiently large, living heartwood which is infected with red heart fungus, so the tree must be over 80 years old (often 100+, age of suitability varies by pine species) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife 2003). Groups are typically comprised of a pair and up to five adult helpers, which are mostly offspring from previous years and mostly male as dispersal is female-biased (Jackson 1994, Conner <em>et al. </em>2001). Eggs are laid from late April to early June (Winkler <em>et al.</em> 1995)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Foraging habitat preferences differ between the sexes and females are negatively influenced by the loss of old-growth trees (<strong></strong>Jackson 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. One study showed that adults were heavier, and both adults and nestlings apparently sourced more food in shortleaf and loblolly pine habitats than in longleaf pine forest (Schaefer <em>et al</em>. 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","Because of its biology and preference for older-growth forest, this    species is said to be uniquely susceptible to rapid declines under inappropriate    management regimes (J. R. Walters <em>in litt</em>. 2013). The long-term clearance and economic management of habitat has reduced the viability of all populations. From the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, the species decreased rapidly as mature  pine forest was altered, primarily for timber harvest  and agriculture (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Longleaf pine communities in the southeastern USA may have originally covered <em>c.</em> 24-37 million ha, but today fewer than 1.2 million ha remain (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). The excessive cutting of old-growth forests is reported to still be taking place in some areas (J. A. Jackson<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012). Suppression of the natural fire regime allowing an increase in mid-storey hardwood density has rendered large areas of habitat unsuitable for the species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). This has isolated nest-sites, making abandonment or group extirpation increasingly likely (Thomlinson 1995); translocation of these isolated groups for population augmentation elsewhere makes the loss of the site certain. Translocation of birds to federal and private lands may also swamp locally adapted gene pools (J. A. Jackson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. Inbreeding depression has been highlighted as a potentially serious problem in small and isolated populations (Schiegg <em>et al</em>. 2006), and may be exacerbated by female-biased dispersal in small and fragmented populations (Dale 2001) which appears the case for the species (Daniels and Walters 2000).&#160;<br/><br/>Fire management (involving regular burning) has aided habitat restoration, but as human populations expand there is increasing pressure to suppress fires. Exempting landowners from the Endangered Species Act has resulted in rapid declines on private land (J. A. Jackson <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. Loss of nesting cavities to Southern flying squirrels <em>Glaucomys volans&#160;</em>may contribute to breeding site limitation, as may cavity enlargement by Pileated Woodpecker&#160;<em>Hylatomus&#160;pileatus</em><em> </em>(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003, Saenz <em>et al. </em>2008). Southern pine beetle <em>Dendroctonus frontalis</em> infests cavities and kills nesting trees (Conner and Rudolph 1995, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 2003)<strong></strong> (although they have a positive effect on woodpecker foraging both as a food item, and by creating arthropod rich dead-wood habitat [Schaefer <em>et al</em>. 2004]<strong></strong>). Beetle infestations have increased since habitat management for the woodpecker started in 1988 (Conner and Rudolph 1995)<strong></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","The population is estimated at 19,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).",Decreasing,"This species was originally distributed throughout the southeastern <strong>USA</strong>; however from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, it declined  rapidly due to the extensive alteration of mature pine forests (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). During the late 20th century it continued to decline, undergoing a large and statistically significant overall  decrease between 1970 and 2014 (81% decline, data from Breeding Bird Survey and/or Christmas Bird Count [Rosenberg&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016]), and James (1995) calculated a 23% decline in the number of known sites (""clusters"", groups of trees actively used by potential breeding groups of mature woodpeckers) between the early 1980s and 1990.&#160;In 1999, it was limited to <em>c.</em> 30 isolated populations (the largest in South Carolina and Florida), totalling <em>c.</em> 4,700 groups or <em>c.&#160;</em>11,000 individuals and occupying just 4,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Jackson 1994, Guynn 1997, J. A. Jackson <em>in litt</em>. 1999). However, the most recent population estimates suggests that the population now exceeds 10,000 mature individuals, with an estimate of 15,000 mature individuals in 2016 (Rosenberg <em>et al. </em>2016) and 19,000 mature individuals in 2018 (Partners in Flight 2019), up from 14,068 individuals, arranged in 5,627 clusters (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). The unusual co-operative breeding biology of the species means that the actual number of reproductive units is lower than that expected from the estimate of mature individuals (D. Wood <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Hence while the overall population may now be stable with the targeted recovery populations increasing (Department of Defense/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <em>in litt.</em> 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008, W. McDearman <em>in litt.</em> 2010), the structure of the population, documented local declines and the continued loss of some clusters suggest that the precautionary approach is to continue to suspect an on-going, slow overall decline.&#160;Its apparent recovery in many areas is the result of successful conservation efforts,  including habitat management, nest-site provision and translocation of  birds (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008), whilst improved knowledge  has been acquired owing to intensive studies. It is not clear if such management ceased, habitat improvements are yet sufficient enough to support continued population increases without the additional intensive management (J. R. Walters&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The emphasis has been on site-specific management (J. A. Jackson <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. Intensive activities include translocating young females from natal sites to groups lacking a female, constructing artificial cavities (Jackson 1994)<strong></strong>, and fitting restrictor plates to prevent <em>D. pileatus</em> enlarging cavities (Carter <em>et al</em>. 1989, Saenz <em>et al.</em> 1998, Wood <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. Adults have also been successfully translocated from sites that have been allowed to become isolated, and can augment the population in the receptor sites, but with lower success than for the translocation of young birds (Herbez <em>et al. </em>2011, Cox and McCormick 2016). Habitat is managed (regular burning and understorey clearance) on some federal lands, but not always appropriately (Jackson 1994)<strong></strong>. Mechanical removal of the midstory and understory, which is substituting burning where fire is difficult to use, however lacks the additional ecological value of fires (D. Wood <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service developed the Red-cockaded Woodpecker Foraging Matrix Application in 2004, which uses a habitat suitability modelling approach to assess the ability of sites to sustain populations via quantitative assessments of stand-level and territory-level habitat quality (McKellar <em>et al. </em>2014). This has been used to assess potential impacts of projects that may affect foraging habitat, such as development, harvesting or modification (e.g. thinning of pine stands) (McKellar <em>et al. </em>2014). In South Carolina the ""Safe Harbor"" scheme offers financial incentives to private landowners who undertake beneficial management prescriptions (<strong></strong>Duncan <em>et al</em>. 2001, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2018)<strong></strong>.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>The species migrates up and down larger rivers, and to and from inland lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, dispersing widely after the breeding season (Tyler 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Migration is driven by the need for calm weather (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Breeding takes place during the dry season when rivers are at their lowest and sandbars most exposed (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. This generally occurs from March to June in West and East Africa, and mainly from July to November south of the equator (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Nigeria the species disperses up to 600km from its breeding sites in June - August (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, moving mainly downstream (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It returns in November or December, coinciding with the onset of strong winds in its non-breeding areas (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Breeding occurs in small colonies of up to 50 pairs (Tyler 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Botswana, it breeds along the Okavango and Chobe rivers between July and November (Tyler, 2012). During the non-breeding season larger flocks are formed, sometimes of up to 1500 birds (Tyler 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong>This species requires expanses of calm water for feeding (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <em>Breeding </em>It breeds along broad rivers on large, dry sandbars that are largely free from vegetation (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It sometimes breeds on sandy lake shores, and very occasionally on sandy sea shores (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>During the non-breeding season it is more commonly found at lakes (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986) and also frequents coastal lagoons, salt-pans, open marshes and estuaries (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is less common along coasts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Vagrant birds may use swamps and artificial habitats such as sewage ponds and dams (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet </strong>It feeds on fish, such as cichlids (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, foraging exclusively in the fashion characteristic of the family Rynchopidae, namely by skimming the water in flight with its mouth open and lower mandible submerged (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.<strong> Breeding site </strong>Eggs are laid in an unlined scrape in the sand (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Scrapes occurs within 2-14m of one another (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986) and are initially created within 30m of the water (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, though falling water levels may increase this distance (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The clutch-size is two or three, rarely four, and the incubation period is c.21 days followed by a fledging period of about four weeks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","Dam-building has flooded some upstream areas and reduced downstream flows, destroying suitable habitat (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Coppinger <em>et al.</em> 1988, Ginn <em>et al.</em> 1989)<strong></strong>. Farming practices have also caused siltation of many rivers, raising river levels and swamping breeding islands (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Ginn <em>et al.</em> 1989)<strong></strong>. Egg-collecting, trapping of adults and general disturbance by humans, cattle and recently increased boat traffic can be serious problems in some areas (Britton 1980, Coppinger <em>et al.</em> 1988, Tyler and Stone 2000)<strong></strong>. Disruption by recreational fishermen may impact breeding colonies in the Okavango Panhandle, and local fishermen have been reported using chicks as bait (Vial 1995; cited in Hancock 2008). Food supplies may have been reduced by pollution, overfishing and introduced predatory fish, but it is unclear whether this has affected its prey of small fry (fish) (Tyler and Stone 2000)<strong></strong>. Large-scale spraying of DDT and general water pollution may result in toxic bioaccumulation of pollutants in these piscivores (Coppinger <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong></strong>. Boat wash, and the hauling out of crocodiles and hippos can cause disturbance on the sandbanks (S.

It is less restricted in the non-breeding season, dispersing to rivers, lakes and coasts in countries as widespread as <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Gambia</strong> and <strong>Botswana</strong>. In Botswana, they disappear from breeding areas in the austral summer and autumn (S. Tyler <em>in litt. </em>2020). Large concentrations (including breeding birds) occur along the Zambezi River (F. Dowsett-Lemaire and R. J. Dowsett <em>in litt</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, e.g. 1,428 individuals (Coppinger <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and non-breeding flocks of at least 1,000 individuals have been recorded in <strong>Tanzania</strong> and <strong>Kenya</strong>. Research by (Gamundani <em>et al.,</em> 2017) suggests that breeding in Zimbabwe has not recovered, more than fifty years after the creation of Lake Kariba. The population is estimated to number 15,000-25,000 birds (with 7,000-13,000 in West and Central Africa and 8,000-12,000 in East Africa and <strong>South Africa</strong>) (T.

Populations in both Ethiopia and South Africa are now thought to be extremely small (although it is unknown whether there is migration between the two areas).<br/><p></p>","<strong>Behaviour:&#160;</strong>The movements of this species are not fully understood, but the lack of subspeciation has been interpreted to imply that the birds migrate between the two subpopulations (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Dalton <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018), and DNA analyses suggest that the species may be migratory (Smit-Robinson 2014; C. Symes&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016; Dalton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). However the fact that there are overlaps in occurrence has prompted suggestions that strict migration is unlikely (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). One suggestion is that long-distance dispersal occurs when numbers are high (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998), with local movements being predominant at other times. Recent findings further support the presence of two subpopulations (South Africa and Ethiopia) that respond nomadically to niche availability (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a, b, c), and could potentially intermingle at disjunct central sites. In 2012 a survey was carried out in south-west Ethiopia during the non-breeding season to understand more about the possible movement of birds between Ethiopia and South Africa, but no birds were found (Drerup 2015). However, recent developments in the use of remote survey methodology have improved the ability to study this highly elusive species (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>, </em>2019). In Ethiopia birds that breed in the central highlands in June-September may move to lower-level habitats during the non-breeding season when the highland areas becomes unsuitable (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Similarly, in South Africa, birds are primarily present in the highland regions in October-March, with isolated low-altitude records outside of this peak period (April-August). This suggests that the species moves nomadically in response to changing niche conditions and could possibly use peat wetlands at lower elevations during the winter. Application of camera-acoustic survey methodology allowed for the successful confirmation of the vocalisations of this species, which is not very audible amongst other wetland and environmental sounds (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020b). In South Africa, the species arrived at highland wetlands shortly after the first large (c.50mm) rainfall in early to mid summer, displacing the resident Red-chested Flufftail in selected sedge dominant habitat patches (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019). Territorial activity commenced immediately, including visual and vocal displays (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019, 2020b).&#160;Visual displays include the voluntary display of white secondaries both when wings were tucked in and during extensive wing-flapping behaviour. These visual displays were noted together with peaks in vocalisations, which were conducted from first light through to 3 hours after sunrise (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020b), with most of the vocalisations done by males. Females were observed to be more active late-morning through to midday, while juveniles were more active during the late-morning and late-afternoon. Chicks fledge by mid-late summer (Colyn <em>et al. </em>2020b). Males may leave wetlands soon after the chicks have fledged, while females remained in wetlands later into summer, and juveniles could remain longer, until the end of March (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2020b).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat:&#160;</strong><em>Breeding</em>&#160;In Ethiopia the species breeds in high-altitude seasonal marshes (between 2,200 and 2,600 m) with dense, rapidly growing vegetation dominated by sedges, grasses and forbs (Taylor 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It occurs here when vegetation has reached 20-40 cm in height and the ground has not yet become entirely flooded (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). Very soon after hatching, it appears to move its chicks to areas of denser vegetation where the ground is more deeply and continuously flooded (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). The species may have specific microhabitat requirements that have not yet been established. In South Africa it inhabits moist to flooded peat-based habitats (mostly at 1,100-2,100 m) where vegetation is dense and dominated by sedges (<em>Carex </em>species), although it is occasionally found in pure stands of Typha and reeds (Davies&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015; Colyn <em>et al. </em>2019). It forages in mud at the edges of reed beds, in shallow water, in floating mats of aquatic vegetation and occasionally on dry ground (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Of the 10 important sites for the species in South Africa, 9 are within the Eastern Uplands, Great Escarpment Mountains and Highveld peatland ecoregions, emphasising the importance of peat-based habitats (Taylor and Grundling 2003)<strong></strong>. Occupancy results from South Africa suggest that increased basal and canopy cover, together with shallower water depths, were the primary factors influencing local occurrence (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019). Studies from Ethiopia showed that the significant drivers of nest site selection were vegetation cover, sedge cover, vegetation height, and water depth (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2020a). When cover was reduced, or the water levels increased, birds immediately abandoned respective sites.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet:&#160;</strong>It feeds on seeds and vegetation as well as insects, spiders, earthworms, small frogs and small fish (De Smidt 2003; see Taylor <em>et al. </em>2018).<strong> </strong>The stomach contents of a deceased chick included coleoptera (Dystiscidae) imagines, Diptera larvae (Tipulidae and Tabanidae), and the remains of small crustaceans.<br/>&#160; <strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>Nests found in Ethiopia are described as a ball of woven live sedge, <em>Eleocharis </em>or<em> Cyperus</em>, and other plant stems and vegetation, with clutches of 4-6 eggs (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004; Allan <em>et al.</em> 2006). Observations at a nest found in August 1999 resulted in an estimated incubation period of 15-16 days.<p></p>","Seasonal marshes are threatened by drainage (for cultivation and forestry), flooding by dams, catchment erosion, water abstraction, human disturbance, too-frequent burning, and excessive trampling and grazing by livestock and cutting of marsh vegetation for fodder (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019,&#160;2020a)<strong></strong>. Observations in Ethiopia suggest that the species moves its chicks very soon after hatching to areas of denser vegetation and deeper flooding before the vegetation at nest sites has grown enough for cutting by local people (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). Grasses and sedges are cut for the culturally important Ethiopian coffee ceremony (De Smidt 2003). In Ethiopia, rapid population growth is resulting in habitat loss and degradation from increasing agricultural practices. Primary threats across the Sululta plain include over-grazing, mowing of wetland vegetation for fodder bale production, and traditional harvesting of vegetation. Currently, more than 90% of all suitable wetland catchments have been completely altered and lost (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Bilacha wetland has already been almost completely converted into agriculture, settlement  and grazing land. Suitable habitat at Weserbi wetland has been completely lost, and housing is spreading close to the remaining small  patch of wet grassland (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Even the  remaining core site, Berga Wetland, is highly threatened as  habitat degradation and  destruction continue unchecked despite attempts to improve the  conservation status of  the area. In addition to the existing overgrazing, trampling and grass  cutting, local people are encroaching  further down to the wetland, converting grassland for subsistence  agriculture and  dividing up small plots of land for grazing. Suitable habitat at Berga has already been reduced by more than 90% and is fragmenting further under land-use pressure (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a).&#160;The peatlands of South Africa are threatened by cultivation, afforestation, grazing, water abstraction, horticulture, peat fires, draining, headcut and donga erosion, siltation, fences and developments such as roads and dams (Taylor and Grundling 2003; Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020c)<strong></strong>. The primary current threat in South Africa is development pressure from the mining industry, agricultural activities, construction of weirs and dams, other sources of flooding, expansion of invasive alien vegetation, and inappropriate management activities such as too-frequent fires and heavy grazing (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020c). Genetic analysis suggests that this species may have a low genetic diversity, and so could be limited in its ability to cope with environmental changes (Dalton <em>et al. </em>2018). Climate change analyses suggest that this species is likely to be very vulnerable to climate change, with large sections of its highland breeding areas potentially contracting by 2050 (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c)<p></p>","The population in South Africa was previously estimated to be 235 birds, with at least a further 210-215 pairs in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 1998), i.e. probably 700 mature individuals in total. The species can only be reliably surveyed in the breeding season in Ethiopia, but surveys risk disturbing nesting and thus have been avoided in the past (Y. D. Adebe <em>in litt.</em> 2013). Nevertheless, the most recent surveys by Colyn <em>et al.</em> (2020a, b) using cameras and acoustic monitoring yielded upper-limit population densities of 1 pair/5.8 ha in Ethiopia, and 1 pair in 6.7 ha in South Africa. This produced population estimates of 55 pairs in Ethiopia, and c.58 pairs in South Africa, producing a global population estimate of c.226 mature individuals, placed here in the band 50-249 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species occurs in <strong>Ethiopia</strong>&#160;(Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Taylor 1998, 1999), and <strong>South Africa</strong> (ten sites in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga [De Smidt 2003], and it can occur at low, coastal altitudes [Davies <em>et al. </em>2015]). There are also historical sightings from&#160;<strong>Zimbabwe </strong>(Colyn <em>et al. </em>2019)&#160;(only a very limited number of accepted records from the 1970s and 1980s [Hustler and Irwin 1995;&#160;<strong></strong>Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Ewbank 2014], and a possible breeding record in the 1950s [Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Taylor 1999]),&#160;and there is little to no recent information about the species's status there. Claimed records from Zambia and Rwanda are unproven (Taylor and van Perlo 1998; F. Dowsett-Lemaire and R. J. Dowsett <em>in litt. </em>1999; P. Leonard <em> in litt. </em>1999). In South Africa, the total population was estimated to be 235 birds by Taylor and van Perlo (1998), but the area of occupancy has since been estimated at 3.92 km<sup>2 </sup>in South Africa (150 ha across the Dullstroom area, 50 ha at Wakkerstroom, the only two recently reliable site) (R. Colyn&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020), and due to low confidence in past estimates and continued threats to the species and its habitat over the past 10 years, the regional population in South Africa may be fewer than 50 birds (Evans <em>et al. </em>2015). <br/><br/>In South Africa, a new site was discovered in 2002 in northern coastal KwaZulu-Natal, following speculation that the species no longer occurred in coastal areas, and further sightings at various location in Free State and KwaZulu-Natal have since been made (Taylor and Grundling 2003; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;In the Ethiopian highlands, 10-15 pairs bred at Sululta in the late 1990s (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; Anon. 1997; J. S. Ash <em>in litt. </em>1999) and c.200 pairs were discovered at a new breeding site (Berga floodplain) in 1997 (Anon. 1997;&#160;<strong></strong>A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998; M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007<strong></strong><strong></strong>). In 2005, a small breeding population was discovered at Bilacha in Ethiopia (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Although Weserbi hosted 10-15 pairs in 2003 (Allan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004), subsequent surveys have failed to record any evidence of presence at this site (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a).&#160;A recent study assessing the available habitat for this species across the Sululta area found the majority of remaining wetland sites were not in a suitable state for this species (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a). Berga Wetland hosts the majority of the remaining habitat for this species across the region, with 61% (158 ha) in the upper reaches, and 37% (71 ha) in the lower reaches. Weserbi is currently unsuitable due to over-grazing and mowing, but should this area improve, it could contribute a further 85 ha of breeding habitat (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a). Bilacha Wetland has been completely fragmented and degraded due to agricultural activities, and currently provides only 1 ha of suitable habitat.<br/><br/>Whether a single population migrates between Ethiopia and South Africa, or each country hosts its own subpopulation, is still not certain (Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Barnes 2000<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>), although observations from a breeding site in Ethiopia discovered in 2005 show that birds continue to breed into the dry season and may remain in Ethiopia after breeding, rather than migrate (A. Tefera <em>per</em> Anon. 2006), and genetic analyses possibly suggest the two subpopulations may intermingle (Dalton <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Recent research has found birds breeding in both Ethiopia (June-August) and South Africa (October-January) two months apart in the same year (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a, b). Suggestions  that the non-breeding grounds for the Ethiopian population could be within  south-west Ethiopia have not been substantiated; seven days of intensive surveys in the Kaffa area in April 2013 found no evidence of the species at seven major wetlands (M. Ewnetu <em>in litt. </em>2013). A recent study of the distribution and available habitat for the species across Africa confirmed that Ethiopia and South Africa hold the majority of suitable habitat, and that there are smaller areas located in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c).&#160;<br/><br/><strong></strong> <p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I and II. Some South African sites have some legal protection, and at least four sites are protected by the landowners (Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>. At the largest Ethiopian breeding population, the vegetation is not cut for fodder until October-November (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, thus giving the birds time to breed without disturbance (Anon. 1997). However, recent surveys by Colyn <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2020a) suggest that the efficacy of this management intervention is deteriorating under increased population growth and land-use pressure, resulting in increased habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation.One of the Ethiopian sites, Berga, is on a state-run dairy farm, and formerly so was Weserbi. The farm at Weserbi has been privatised, but the marsh still remains under the control of the central Dairy Farm Enterprise based in Addis Ababa (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. There is a Site Support Group at Berga, formed by the Ethiopian Wildlife and Natural History Society (De Smidt 2003).<strong>&#160;</strong>Support from organisations including the Middelpunt Wetland&#160;Trust helped to build a primary school (which is now named after the species) for the Berga community and the villagers acknowledge the value of the species (Drummond 2013), and a document is in preparation to formalise the Berga community project (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt. </em>2016). In South Africa, the Middelpunt Wetland Trust was formed in 1994 with the main objective of conserving the species and its habitat (De Smidt 2003; M. Drummond <em>in litt. </em>2005). In 2003, a partnership was formed to mitigate the effects of the Braamhoek (formally changed to Ingula) pumped storage scheme. Ingula has since been proclaimed as a nature reserve, and as such has secured some habitat for the species. Verloren Vallei, Seeikoeivlei and Ntsikeni Vlei are formally protected areas in South Africa, that currently host the majority of highly suitable habitat for the species (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c). In June 2003, a national Species Action Planning stakeholder workshop was held in Wakkerstroom, South Africa, to assess the threats facing the species in this country, and concluded with the agreement that a South African White-winged Flufftail Action Group be established (De Smidt 2003), which was formed by the Department of Environmental Affairs in South Africa in 2016 (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;<br/>An International Species Action Plan was published in 2008 (Sande <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). An AEWA Small Grants Fund supported project in Ethiopia ran from July 2012 to September 2014 (Drerup 2015). The project held four awareness-raising workshops, distributed 1,000 copies of a brochure about the species to schools, local government and the local community and produced a billboard poster to increase awareness. The project enabled protection of the species at its breeding site in the Berga wetlands: 3 ha were fenced off and members of the Site Support Group patrolled the area (these activities were to continue post-completion of the project); soil conservation measures were also implemented to reduce erosion (Drerup 2015). BirdLife South Africa have established a long-term survey being conducted annually since 2016 at core sites within Mpumalanga, South Africa. These surveys assess the ecology, demography and population dynamics, with the results having been synthesised into best practice guidelines for habitat management (BirdLife South Africa <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;In 2015 the second meeting of the AEWA White-winged Flufftail International Working Group was held in Addis Ababa, with a follow up third meeting taking place in South Africa in 2019. An Implementation Plan was developed to ensure the implementation of actions outlined in the ISSAP. The first confirmed breeding record from the southern hemisphere at Middelpunt Wetland, South Africa has resulted in the abandonment of establishing a captive facility, and the focusing of efforts on the conservation of the species’ habitat (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Secure habitat under formal protection, and promote appropriate management practices that don't deteriorate wetland habitat. Maintain and restore suitable habitat at breeding areas in Ethiopia through sustainable use under community-based conservation programmes, and it has been proposed that the conservation statue of the Berga Wetland be upgraded (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; <strong></strong>Taylor and van Perlo 1998; M. Drummond <em>in litt. </em>2016). Protect additional sites in South Africa, and a long term goal is also to declare Middelpunt Wetland a nature reserve (Barnes 2000; Evans <em>et al. </em>2015; H.

Continue surveys in Ethiopia and southern Africa to better define its range, population, seasonal movements and habitat requirements (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; A.

While the species is presently abundant on islands where tern colonies survive, it appears to disappear rapidly once seabird colonies fail and it has not been observed to recolonize islands once terns re-establish colonies. At present the species seems not to be at risk of near-future global extinction as despite ongoing poaching of seabirds it remains abundant where it occurs and rates of seabird colony loss have been low over the last century. There is, however, a plausible future risk that changes in the environment of the islands resulting from climate change could accelerate seabird declines or promote abandonment of the existing colonies, in which case the skink would be at immediate risk of extinction. A decline in effective population size suggests that this species was likely to have been more abundant and possibly more widespread historically, but the timeframe and drivers for this decline are unknown.","It is found only in seabird colonies in dry forest and shrubland, where it is a generalist scavenger and predator both terrestrially and arboreally. It has been observed scavenging on the beach outside forest in early morning on Aride (S. Rocha pers. comm. 2020). The lizard's faeces have been found to contain seeds, and it is possible this is an important seed disperser on islands where it occurs (S. Rocha pers. comm. 2020). It is an egg-laying species.","There are no direct threats, but the species is susceptible to the loss of the seabird colonies on which it depends; these are at risk from human disturbance (including poaching, which is ongoing - J. Gerlach pers. comm. 2020) and two known subpopulations have been lost within little more than a century following the loss of seabirds from these islands. Although this skink has been observed to recolonize vacant islands, no detectable colonization has taken place on islands occupied by the competitor <em>Trachylepis sechellensis</em>, including islands this more adaptable species has colonized following extinction of <em>T. wrightii</em>&#160;(Gerlach 2005). Any impacts on the seabird colonies - e.g. from changes in weather conditions or fish movements - resulting from climate change are likely to have adverse effects on the skinks, and there is a potential impact from coastal erosion although at present any impacts of this latter on the lizard is ""debatable"" (J. Gerlach pers. comm. 2020). Rat invasion is another potential threat (J. Gerlach pers. comm. 2020). Cats, another potential predator, are not present on any islands where the skink occurs (J. Gerlach pers. comm. 2020).","Although restricted to a tiny area, the population was estimated at 376,205 ± 5,409 animals in 2005 (Gerlach 2008). It was described as ""locally abundant"" on Aride by Davis and Venis (1998), who recorded 31 individuals during a series one-hour surveys over the course of two weeks, and it is ""very abundant"" on Frégate (S. Rocha pers. comm. 2020). Genetic estimates of historical effective population size suggests that these are much lower for this species than for&#160;<em>Trachylepis sechellensis&#160;</em>and have declined over time (Rocha&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). It is hypothesized that this may reflect a substantial historical range contraction (S. Rocha pers. comm. 2020). If so the drivers of this decline are not known, but may be related to evidence of widespread hybridization with <em>T. sechellensis </em>in the south of its range (Rocha <em>et al.</em> 2016). The species currently occurs in high densities where it occurs.",Stable,"This species is endemic to the Seychelles, where it occurs only on islands with seabird colonies: Aride, Cousin, Cousine, St. Pierre, Mammelles, Frégate, and Récifs (Gerlach 2005, Rocha<em> et al. </em>2013). There are records from Marianne and Isle aux Vaches, but it is no longer present on these islands following the loss of seabird colonies in the mid-1800s and 1980s respectively (Gerlach 2005, J. Gerlach pers. comm. 2006). The record from Ile aux Vaches is considered questionable, but may reflect a wider historical range on the southern islands (S. Rocha pers. comm. 2020). These islands have since been colonized by the more adaptable <em>Trachylepis sechellensis</em>, and <em>T. wrightii </em>appears not to have recolonized Isle aux Vaches following the reestablishment of a tern colony (Gerlach 2005). A record from Mahé is considered questionable. The St. Pierre subpopulation was ""obvious and abundant"" here in surveys in 2000 but no members of this genus were detected here during surveys in the 1980s, suggesting that it represented a recent colonization (Gerlach 2005). More recent DNA data indicates that the St. Pierre subpopulation has a unique haplotype, suggesting that it may have been present for longer than previously suspected (Rocha <em>et al. </em>2016).",There is no significant use of or trade in this species.,Terrestrial,"It is present in the Aride, Cousin and Cousine Special Reserves. Further research is recommended to clarify the ecological requirements of this species and whether it is genuinely reliant on seabird colonies, or whether the observed loss of skinks from islands where tern colonies have failed reflects independent responses to a common threat.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The population has undergone a population increase due to previous conservation efforts. Albeit, based on threats such as invasive species, fisheries and climatic events, habitat quality is thought to be undergoing a continued decline.&#160;It consequently qualifies as Near Threatened. If ongoing and potential threats continue to degrade the species's habitat however, it may warrant uplisting in the future.&#160;<p></p> <p></p>","It excavates deep burrows in thick guano for nesting, but may also burrow in sandy soils or use natural rock crevices. Breeding has been recorded throughout the year (Riveros-Salcedo and Jahncke Aparicio 1990, Jahncke and Goya 1998)<strong></strong>, with least activity in November. There are two breeding periods, with some evidence that individual birds breed twice annually (Riveros-Salcedo and Jahncke Aparicio 1990, Jahncke and Goya 1998, M. de L. Brooke <em>verbally </em>2000)<strong></strong>. In the non-breeding season, it occurs close to breeding islands in the rich upwelling waters of the Humboldt Current. In Peru, it feeds, even in heavily fished areas, on small crustaceans and small fish (mostly larvae) (Jahncke <em>et al</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. At La Vieja Island, Peru, Peruvian anchovy <em>Engraulis ringens </em>(33.9%), the small krill <em>Euphausia mucronata</em> (26.8%) and squat lobster <em>Pleuroncodes monodon </em>(24.3%) were the most important prey species (García-Godos and Goya 2006)<strong></strong>. High monthly variability in the main prey species suggests an opportunistic feeding behaviour associated with prey avaliability (García-Godos and Goya 2006)<strong></strong>.     <p></p>","<p>El Niño Southern Oscillation events are known to significantly alter the distribution of Peruvian Diving-petrel prey, reducing the diversity of prey items available to the diving-petrel (García-Godos and Goya 2006), as well as altering weather patterns (M. de L. Brooke <em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999). Its philopatric nature may additionally suggest that rescue by migration is untenable, with the population thus vulnerable to ongoing anthropogenic pressures (Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Bycatch by artisanal fisheries represents a threat to the species, but previously speculated impact of the exploitation of anchovies throughout the species's range does not appear to be valid: the birds take smaller fish than targeted by the fishery and appear to respond far more strongly to sea surface temperature variation (García-Godos and Goya 2006). However, within a 14-year period, c. 178 Peruvian Diving-petrels were found dead due to interactions with fisheries suggesting that competition with fisheries remain persistent (C. E. Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species can also be hunted for food on some islands (M. de L. Brooke <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Other human-driven threats include tourism, egg collection and light pollution (Simeone <em>et al</em>. 2003, Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Lack of adequate biosecurity measures (such as unmanaged visits to some breeding sites) also remains a potential threat due to potential introduction of invasive species (C. Wolf and N. Holmes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;</p><p></p>  <p>Invasive mammalian predators represent another threat. Peruvian Diving-petrels are thought to have been eradicated completely by foxes, <em>Pseudolopex</em> spp., in parts of the range and foxes have subsequently prevented recolonisation of these areas (Vilina 1992);&#160;Chañaral Island alone may have held over 100,000 pairs prior to fox introduction (A. Simeone&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Cats <em>Felis catus&#160;</em>and rats <em>Rattus </em>spp. are present on several islands within the species's range (Jahncke <em>et al</em>. 1999) and likely depredate adults and nests respectively. Fisherman may also chase rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cunniculus</em>) which could inadvertently destroy burrows (Simeone&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). House mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>)&#160;have moreover seen a rapid increase in recent years on Isla La Vieja (C. E. Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Dogs are present on San Gallan, where they may have played a significant role in reducing the resident population, however, this is a minority of the population (Jahncke <em>et al</em>. 1999). These invasive mammals may also prohibit re-colonisation of some islands (C. E. Fernández <em>et al</em>. <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;</p>  <p>Mining for guano continues to happen every 5-7 years in La Vieja islands, but the population here has increased in recent decades suggesting that the current harvest regime is not impacting the species. Formerly destructive guano mining is thought to have been the main driver for large reductions in the population size and, if harvesting regimes become less sustainable, may again threaten the persistence of the species (M. de L. Brooke <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Two larger harbors are however planned to be built in the future to help with guano mining, likely to affect coastal foraging, nesting areas, and increased disturbance due to light (Cristofari <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","Based on colony observations, breeding populations are thought to occur in two main regions in Peru and Chile (C.

In Peru, 11,100 breeding pairs were observed on Isla La Vieja in 1995, 1,109 on Isla San Gallán in 1996, and 10 on Corcovado Island in 2005. In 2010, 36,450 pairs were recorded on Isla La Vieja alone, indicating a significant increase since the mid-90s (C. Zavalaga&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2010). There are an unknown number on Guañape Sur (A. Simeone <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Chile, 8 breeding pairs were observed on Fernández Vial Island (date unknown), 432 on Pan de Azúcar Island in 2012 (although higher counts of 3,317 pairs were observed in 2009 here, such numbers are considered uncertain, with little explanation behind possible inflation in population size),&#160;97 on Isla Grande de Atacama in 2013 (with the small population residing here thought to form a population sink for migrant birds from neighbouring islands; Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019), 10,789-11,934 on Isla Choros during 2013-2014, and 40 on Isla Pájaros II in 2014 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, A. Simeone <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The overall population size remains high ,with the Chilean population currently estimated to number 12,500 breeding pairs (with 95% on Choros Island; Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) and the Peruvian population tentatively thought to number at least 40,000 pairs (following observations of 36,450&#160;breeding pairs on Isla La Vieja alone; C. Zavalaga&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2010). This roughly equates to 52,500 pairs, rounded here to 50,000 pairs overall and converted to 100,000 mature individuals. The species's colonies are considered to be genetically isolated, with low migration rate due to its highly philopatric nature (Cristofari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, A. Simeone&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).",Increasing,"<em>Pelecanoides garnotii</em> formerly bred on offshore islands from Isla Lobos de Tierra, <strong>Peru</strong>, to Isla Chiloé, <strong>Chile</strong>. It was numerous, e.g. there were c.100,000 pairs, and perhaps more, on Isla Chañaral, Chile, in 1938 (Vilina 1992), but the population has since declined significantly. Overall, the largest breeding colonies are attributed to the La Vieja-San&#160;Gallán islands in Peru and Choros islands in Chile, separated by 1,300 km (C. E. Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Peru, there were c.12,000-13,000 pairs on San Gallán and La Vieja Islands in 1995-1996 (Jahncke and Goya 1998)<strong></strong>. This is considerably higher than the c.1,500 individuals estimated in the early 1990s, probably because of improved information rather than an actual increase. In May-August 2010 a new survey of the La Vieja Islands documented 102,343 active nests (c.95% on La Vieja), of which 36,450 were occupied, indicating at least a three-fold increase in pairs since 1996, and possibly significantly more (C. Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2010). Two small colonies were found on Corcovado Island, Peru in 2005, extending the current breeding distribution c.700 km north of La Vieja, a main breeding centre (Valverde 2006)<strong></strong>. A colony may also be present again on the Lobos de Afuera Islands where two individuals were sighted in 2003 and 2004 (Figueroa and Stucchi 2008)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/>Recently, new colonies have been found on Lobos de Afuera and Corcovado suggesting the species's reappearance there (E. Frere <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Chile, 220 nests were also found on Isla Pan de Azúcar in the late 1980s, where 500+ were seen offshore in November 1993 (S. N. G. Howell <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, and 300 nests were reported on Isla Choros in the late 1980s, which had increased to an estimated 1,550 active nests in 2001-2003 (<strong></strong>Simeone <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. However, high densities of nests were recorded on 4 islands north of Chile (Chañaral, Damas, Choros and Gaviota islands), with suggested densities of up to 1,400 individuals per hectare (Cruz-Jofré and Vilina 2014).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>It has been recorded throughout the year near Isla Chañaral, and may still breed there or on small islands to the south (Vilina 1992)<strong></strong>. A more recent survey found evidence of the species entering artificial burrows on Chañaral, with footprints observed in social attraction sites; however, no nesting has yet been observed (C. Wolf and N. Holmes <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong>All colonies are in reserves but only La Vieja has trained guards (Jahncke <em>et al</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>.

Pan de Azúcar is declared a National Park, with a management plan granted in 2002, Choros is also a National Reserve with a management plan granted in 2009, whilst Grande de Atacama is a Coastal Marine Protected Area (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2019). There have been searches for additional colonies in Chile (Vilina 1992)<strong></strong>. Strong biosecurity measures are in place on Choros and Chañaral Islands (due to the National Forest Corporation's [CONAF] management of the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve), albeit other breeding sites may be lacking in this (C. Wolf and N. Holmes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). A rabbit eradication programme conducted on Choros Island in 2013 was observed to have led to higher densities of the species post-eradication (C.

Meadowlarks are vulnerable to predation from mid-sized predators and snakes. Survival of fledglings is low the first week of fledgling due to immobility of young, increasing vulnerability to snake predation (Kershner <em>et al</em>. 2004). Additionally, pesticide use may be leading to species mortality as both breeding females and post-fledgling juveniles have been observed to use fields treated with agricultural chemicals (Kershner 2001).

It no longer qualifies as Vulnerable as there is no continuing decline. Recent increases in the population have been driven by a reduction in adult mortality through a combination of winter habitat protection and creation, and potentially also a temporary increase in the extent of suitable breeding habitat due to glacial melting. <br/><br/>The species remains Near Threatened as it is plausible that further changes in breeding habitat driven by climate change will reverse the positive recent impact and result in loss of wetlands. In addition there is concern that the impact of existing threats will grow, specifically from feral dogs and human disturbance at breeding sites, and power line collisions and accidental poisoning events during migration and the non-breeding season.<p></p> <p></p>","It breeds in alpine bog meadows and riverine marshes, favouring lacustrine marshes from 2,600-4,900 m. It prefers to nest at large water bodies, at a water depth of around 30 cm: this probably minimises exposure to nest predators. It winters in river valleys and along reservoir shorelines in the vicinity of barley and spring wheat fields. Whilst it prefers breeding in lakes, shallow marshes and meadows are the most important habitat for feeding; its diet consists of roots, tubers, insects, snails, shrimps, fish, frogs, small birds and rodents (Wu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009; Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010a, 2014).<br/><p></p>","Threats to the species are primarily connected with the availability of sufficient undisturbed habitat with suitable water levels. There is evidence that Black-necked Cranes are becoming concentrated at fewer sites in wintering locations, with some previously used areas being converted to greenhouse agriculture or for industrial development (Jia <em>et al. </em>2019). The general increase in the human population in the vicinity of the wetlands the species uses results in higher water demands that can reduce the suitability of key sites, while some have been directly drained for development (Lhendup and Webb 2009). Consequently, development projects that affect the control of water levels must account for the potential impact on the species, which is highly sensitive to water levels due to the threat from mammalian predators. At Dashanbao National Nature Reserve, China, plans to designate the area as a National Park include the relocation of people away from the core zone, however the increasing population of Black-necked Crane demonstrate a clear affinity for human sites due to the provision of waste grain from farming activities (Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The relocation plan would lead to the abandonment of&#160;farmland, upon which the cranes depend (Kong&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011. Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Wu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This represents a potential significant reduction in the number of cranes that this key site can support over winter in the future, which may drive increased adult mortality in this section of the population. Currently, a payment for ecosystem services pilot appears to be contributing towards a steady increase in crane numbers here (Peng <em>et al. </em>2020). A switch to planting a greater proportion of winter wheat reduces the availability of grain on cultivated land, and Peng <em>et al. </em>(2020) also demonstrate that the species generally avoids ploughed fields.&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change appears to be having a positive effect on the species's habitat over recent years (Li 2019), but there is concern that future change will reverse any positive impacts due to drying of breeding sites within the high altitude breeding range of the species (J. Harris&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007, M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In some areas water levels may be rising as a result of glacial melt and increased rainfall, but a lot of shallow wetlands used by the cranes are thought to be disappearing due to permafrost degradation (Farrington 2009). For example, in Ladakh, India, Lake Tsomoriri showed a rise in water between 2000-2006 and then the water level started decreasing, whereas Tsokar Basin is shrinking (P. Chandan&#160;<em>pers comm. per&#160;</em>M. A. Bishop and F. Li.&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). These peripheral areas of the population may be the first to demontrate negative impacts and these populations should be carefully monitored.<br/><br/>A small number of birds have been killed after striking power-lines (Li 2002; Li&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012), and wind turbines could prove an additional threat (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;The threat from power-lines is suspected to be growing following the rapid expansion of local power grids in China: 9 out of 15 juvenile Black-necked Crane fitted with satellite tags were killed in Linzhou, Tibet between 2018-2020 (Y. Guo&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). The use of poisoned bait to control rodent pests in breeding areas poses the risk of unintentional posioning (Li 2019). Intensive grazing has caused degradation of grasslands in breeding grounds, with an increase in grazing in wetlands of particular concern (Li 2019). In Bhutan and India, feral dogs have been increasingly observed to take eggs and chicks, and even adults (I. Acharja <em>in litt. </em>2020, S. Dhumal <em>in litt. </em>2020, J. Eaton <em>in litt. </em>2020,&#160;&#160;L. Visuddha <em>in litt. </em>2020)<br/>There are additional threats from poorly-regulated tourism to wintering areas, which could cause significant disturbance to large numbers of birds and reduce habitat area and quality through the creation of additional infrastructure such as roads (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Fish-farming, peat and firewood collection, river channelisation, industrial pollution and sedimentation, and the construction of roads and fences have resulted in increased disturbance and habitat degradation in Qinghai, Sichuan, Ruoergai and Yunnan, China (Wu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, Qiang Liu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). Further disturbance at the species's stopover sites arises from the use of the areas as camping grounds by local herders (Qian&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).&#160;The collection of eggs and poaching have been problems in parts of China and India, although the extent of this is currently not thought to be significant.","The global population is estimated at c.10,000-10,200 individuals in total (Li <em>et al </em>2014), roughly equivalent to&#160;c.6,600-6,800 mature individuals.

Restrict livestock at Napahai (China) and maintain a network of farmed areas as wetlands (Qiang Liu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Continue to investigate the species's migration and monitor birds along migration routes (Lhendup and Webb 2009). Include newly identified stopover sites, most of which are not already protected, in the nature reserve system, especially those threatened by disturbance from local herders (Qian <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Designate breeding areas in Ladakh (India) as waterbird sanctuaries.&#160;Ban settlement expansion in important areas of crane habitat in Bhutan. Careful planning on tourist/eco-tourist development in both wintering and breeding areas. Regulate tourist access to the species. Educate farmers and implement subsidies in important areas to promote management that suits the cranes, and reduce disturbance (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Additionally, implement education programmes for the general public, especially students, teachers and policy makers; and promote this species as a flagship for the preservation of high-altitude wetland ecosystems (M. A. Bishop and F. Li <em>in litt. </em>2016). Create a new action plan for the species (Lhendup and Webb 2009). Monitor the species and its habitat focusing on the impact from climatic and glacial changes on breeding habitats. Establish baseline information on chemical contaminants, including heavy metals and pesticides, to assess impact of these factors on cranes (M. A. Bishop and F.

Whilst the situation is more concerning in Southeast Asia despite its marginal occurrence here, localised declines also continue to occur across India, of which currently holds the majority of the population. Comprehensive monitoring is however required to limit uncertainty in population trends.","It inhabits rivers and freshwater lakes, also occurring rarely on estuaries, and breeds on sandy and rocky islands, especially along river banks (Mundkur 1991, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species is known to be breed in high concentrations in large reservoirs and rivers, as well as natural and artificial wetlands in India (G. Sundar <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Some sandbanks may also be used for nesting due to temporary exposure after irrigation and water management from nearby reservoirs (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160; It has been recorded up to 600 m in Nepal. It feeds predominantly on fish, small crustaceans, insects, and frogs (Mundkur 1991). Breeding occurs mainly in February-May, although the season may extent from November to May (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Mundkur 1991).","Nesting areas are vulnerable to flooding, predation and disturbance (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160;In a 2017-2019 study in Odisha, India, flooding, predation and cyclones were the main threats (Debrata 2019, Kar <em>et al</em>. in prep). Local fishermen also report that children collect eggs and chicks from sandbanks, which may pose a substantial threat to ground-nesting birds. Strangling of chicks in discarded fish nets is being recorded at different areas and may pose a growing risk (Narwade and Fartade 2013, Reshamwala 2017). Sand and gold mining is an emerging threat for breeding colonies of Indian Skimmer, with which the River Tern nests and is thought to have a long-term effect on nesting-island formation (Das 2015, Shaikh <em>et al</em>. 2018, Debata <em>et al.</em> 2019, C.&#160;Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Poor water level management along rivers are additionally affecting the stability of colonies (T. Mundkur <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In several places in India, human disturbance, encroachment of wetlands by cities, disturbance by photographers and birdwatchers, egg and chick trampling by domestic water buffalo and Chital deer is common (Amoghavarsha 2013, S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Future plans for water transportation routes on the&#160;Ayeyawady, and dredging on the Chindwin River for commercial and passenger transport&#160;may further create localised threats (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Predation of eggs and chicks by a variety of terrestrial animals including domestic dogs, Lesser Bandicoot Rat (<em>Bandicota bengalensis</em>), Monitor Lizard (<em>Varanus salvator</em>; Mundkur 1991), and avian predators including House Crow (<em>Corvus splendens</em>; Siddiqui <em>et al</em>. 2007), Black-headed Ibis (<em>Threskiornis melanocephalus;&#160;</em>Parimala 2013, Reshamwala 2017), Pallas’s Fishing Eagle (<em>Haliaeetus leucophus</em>; Lowther 1949) and Bonelli's Eagle (<em>Aquila fasciata</em>; Belur 2014) may be taking their toll. Invasive plants such as <em>Mimosa pigra </em>may also reduce nest success and chick survival (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>The negative population trend in Laos is probably due mainly to excessive human disturbance on sandbars (Thewlis <em>et al</em>. 1998). In Nepal, it is&#160;threatened by food shortage, illegal and over-fishing in protected areas, destruction of breeding habitats on rivers, disturbance and hunting (K. Bhusal <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cambodia, a study of breeding colonies in 2010-2015 found that egg collection, predation by rodents, crows and domestic dogs and trampling by domestic water buffalo were responsible for low breeding success (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2017, J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2018).&#160;The study found very little evidence of direct hunting of the species, although a snare was once found at a nest (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160; The multitude of dam construction projects completed, underway or planned in South-East Asia (e.g. along the Mekong river [F. Goes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011]<em></em>) may also threaten the species through changes to flow regime and flooding of nest-sites. Dams along the Sesan river in Vietnam have precipitated the decline and led to near-extirpation of the species downstream in Cambodia (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Its habitat may be threatened by the construction of dams  in the Dayingjiang region of south-western Yunnan (Yang Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>.  2011, Dasgupta 2019). In Nepal it is severely threatened by food shortages owing to illegal fishing inside protected areas and overfishing outside protected areas, it is also threatened by destruction of breeding habitat, disturbance and hunting (Inskipp <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Myanmar, planned developments may potentially threaten the species in the future (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Breeding sites along the Indus River (passing between the plains of Punjab and Sindh provinces) are threatened with encroachment and conflict, as well as agricultural expansion leading to increases in human settlements and live stock (M. Ali <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","A previous Asian Waterbird Census' observed 5,733 birds during 1987-1992, 5,558 during 1993-1997, 9,963 during 1998-2002, and 7,578 during 2003-2007 across some Indian and Pakistan sites (Li <em>et al</em>. 2009). Further surveys for the 2008-2015 period then observed across all of Asia and Australasia found an overall 29,577 birds across Myanmar (39 birds), Thailand (2), Bangladesh (74), India (17,776), Nepal (31), Pakistan (11,485)&#160;and Cambodia (170) (Mundkur <em>et al</em>. 2017). Under-counting is however thought to have been a major factor. Populations in the Southeast Asian part of its range are however very small and at higher risk of extinction (F. Goes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In the whole Mekong basin for example, the population is currently estimated at less than 100 birds (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Using the best available information therefore, the population is thought to number at least 29,500 individuals, with the potential to reach a maximum of 100,000 individuals, assuming some surveys may be under-counted. Using a rounded population size of 30,000-100,000 individuals therefore, the population is placed in the band of 20,000-70,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species occurs along river systems across a wide range in southern and south-east Asia, being found in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pakistan</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bangladesh</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Myanmar</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Thailand</span>,&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cambodia</span>,&#160;and southern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span> (Yunnan), as well as <strong>Nepal, Bhutan, Laos, </strong>and <strong>Vietnam </strong>during the non-breeding season ([T.

Whilst the population in India, Bangladesh (albeit has become rare here), Pakistan, Myanmar and Cambodia are largely resident with some seasonal movement, the species will have additional local movement in India, often migrating to Nepal (considered rare) and Bhutan during the non-breeding season, with breeders from southwest China migrating to northern Laos (T. Mundkur <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>It has also reportedly declined in abundance in Thailand, where it is now considered very rare (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>.1996). The species has declined along the Mekong River, in Laos since the early 20th century (Thewlis <em>et al</em>. 1998), and was very close to being extirpated from the country (W. Duckworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). It has also been undergoing a strong decline along the Mekong River system in Cambodia since 2003, with extirpation or sharp declines noted in the number of pairs throughout its breeding range since 2007 (Goes 2014, F. Goes&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2016). Specific conservation actions, alongside nest protection and exclosure have however slowed down decline rates and stabilised the core Mekong population (Classern 2018, F. Goes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>It however no longer breeds on the Tonle Sap, the Mekong below Kratie, or Sesan River (Goes 2014, Claassen 2018). In Cambodia the species has declined by &gt;80% in the past 20 years and in 2018, the population was estimated to be 54-62 individuals whilst less than 50 birds are thought to exist currently (Claassen 2018, S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Moreover, only 2-3 pairs are thought to occur at Sekong River in Siem Pang (J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Two nests were observed in May 2019 at Khang Lok Krau, albeit only one was observed 3 days later due to rat predation&#160; (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2019). During the 2017-2019 period overall, further records showed only one pair that nested on a particular river stretch in Myanmar (with nesting deemed unsuccessful due to flooding in 2019), a decrease from 65-69 birds observed during the 2003-2004 period (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In China, the species occurs along two river systems, including the Dayingjiang River in Southwestern Yunnan and the Yarlung Zangbo River in Southeastern Tibet (W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is described as uncommon along the Dayingjiang river in south-western Yunnan (Yang Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, Dasgupta 2019). The number of species present on the Dayingjiang River had declined from 30 birds to less than 5-13 between 2010-2019, with only 5 individuals recorded in early 2020; 11 individuals are however currently thought to reside on this river temporarily after one pair successfully raised two clutches, harbouring 3 juveniles each (X. Zheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020, W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020), suggesting temporary recovery of the population here. 3 individuals have additionally been sighted on a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River in 2018. It may also occur in small numbers on the Ruili River, between the border of China and Myanmar (H. Fen-Qi <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Pakistan, the species is common throughout most small and large wetlands, subjected to only selective declines in particular sites (Z. Shaikh <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>The species has greatly declined to a few pairs that may breed at few sites on the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers in Myanmar (Zöckler 2020, A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020), with only one breeding site in Bangladesh (Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Recent sightings at Padma River in the Rajshahi Division are confirmed however, with 10-20 pairs observed continuously&#160;over the last decade on the Bangladeshi coast (S. Chowdhury <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;</span>Only one pair was observed near Bhamo on the Ayeyarwady River between Myitkyina and Bagan during 2017-2019 (Zöckler&#160;2020). This is after 81 birds observed in the early 2000s. More than 40 birds were although recorded at Chindwin River in recent surveys (2018-2019; C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Nepal, the species is now a rare and very local visitor, with a maximum population of 20 individuals estimated in 2016, having rapidly declined since the 1990s (Inskipp&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is only regularly recorded from two protected areas here; Bardia National Park and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (K. Bhusal <em>in litt</em>. 2020, R. Chaudhary <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In contrast to declines noted in South-East Asia, the species is now more regular in southern India than was once thought, having probably benefited from the development of reservoirs (Praveen J.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012). At Pong Dam hydro-electric power station for example, 384 nests were observed in 2006 (with 126 nests observed on Ranseer Island), 400 nests in 2015, with an average sighting record of 800-1,000 birds every winter (S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;22 nests were recorded in 2016 at a sandbar near Mundali Dam, downstream of the Mahanadhi (Odisha state; S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Likewise, the species is described as having increased in Andhra Pradesh over the past 10 years (S. Riyazuddin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Encroachment of wetlands by cities and developments have however led to drastic declines in altered wetlands since the late 1990's (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). At Chilika Lake (Odisha state), despite previously harbouring c. 1,500 birds and particularly 300-400 birds on the Nalabana Island (located within the lake), the species has seen marginal declines here for example; 540 nests were found in 2002, with declines beginning in 2003, leading to only 200 nests in 2008, and subsequently below 50 nests in 2010, and complete abandonment of the island by 2011 (S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020). 20-30 nests have since been observed on a nearby, unprotected island (Panchgudhi; S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Declines (likely attributed to fishing camps) have also been observed in sandy islands and tracts in&#160;Brahmaputra, Subansiri, Lohit and Dibang (A.&#160;Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Alternatively, 11,000 nests were recently found at Almatti Backwaters in Bagalkot, Karnataka over 12 exposed sandy islands (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Despite some localised declines therefore, the species is overall considered to be widespread in large numbers across many artificial and natural wetlands in India (G. Sundar <em>in litt</em>. 2020).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Conservation Actions Underway</span><br/>The species is protected under Schedule-IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (State of India's Birds 2020). The species is considered At Risk in Laos, Critical in Thailand, Critical in Cambodia (Goes 2014) and Critically Endangered in Nepal (Inskipp <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species occurs in a number of protected areas. In Cambodia, nest protection programmes have been implemented by the World Wildlife Fund on the Mekong River and by the Royal University of Phnom Penh on the Sekong and Sesan rivers (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2016). These programmes involve education, employing local people as nest guards and the use of predator exclosures&#160;(A. Claassen&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Local conservation efforts is thought to enable temporary recover of the species on Dayingjiang Rive (W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Cambodia, a Species Action Plan has been prepared for 2018-2028 (Claassen 2018), however this currently lacks funding to be implemented properly (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Myanmar,&#160;a nest protection programme is being implemented on the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers by the Wildlife Conservation Society (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Community Conservation Areas (CCA's) are also proposed to maintain the last remaining sites along the Ayeyarwady River (Zöckler&#160;2019). In China (Yunnan), nest protection is being led by the Kandoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020, X. Zheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Direct payments have additionally proven successful in implementing nest protection, however require continued use of monitoring, community relations and exclosures (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2017).

Based on counts of breeding birds at rivers in the South Island of New Zealand, the population may have undergone a reduction of over 30% over the past three generations, but winter counts from New Zealand indicate a slower decline, and winter counts from Australia do not indicate a reduction over the past three generations. For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.","It usually breeds inland on sand or gravel banks alongside braided rivers, or in dry montane habitats with short vegetation at high altitudes, although it also breeds in a range of other habitats including coasts, pasture, ploughed arable land, quarries and moors (Heather and Robertson 1996, Wiersma <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;Outside the breeding season, it occurs in a range of coastal and freshwater habitats, usually near the coast, including estuaries, swamps, lagoons, beaches, salt-lakes, saltmarshes, grassland and pasture (Heather and Robertson 1996, Wiersma <em>et al. </em>2019). During winter, it roosts in flocks at traditional and often at inaccessible sites (Wiersma <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). It feeds on molluscs, insects, crustaceans, marine worms, spiders, seeds and berries (Wiersma <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). It breeds in July- January (Heather and Robertson 1996).","Introduced mammalian predators are likely to be a major threat. Video camera studies in the Upper Waitaki Basin have detected predation by cats, ferrets and hedgehogs (Sanders and Maloney 2002). Of 114 nests monitored, around half suffered predation events (Sanders and Maloney 2002). A study of 161 nests in the Tasman River found that 89% were successful, with losses attributed to predation and flooding (Cruz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;In the Auckland Islands, the species may have disappeared from the main island as a result of predation by cats and pigs (Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991).<br/>Other threats include hydroelectricity developments and irrigation schemes, which lead to degradation of their riverbank nesting habitat (Heather and Robertson 1996). Encroachment of invasive plant species leads to a loss of breeding habitat on river beds. Extreme tides and flooding events may impact the species, and human disturbance may cause breeding attempts to fail. A study of 33 nesting attempts on beaches on an oceanic spit in North Canterbury found that 40% of eggs were lost to tidal or river floods, and 29% were lost due to human disturbance (Kearvell 2011). Low minimum river flow was also associated with lower breeding success, probably necause it allowed for easier access by predators (Cruz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).<br/>In Australia, the species is thought to be threatened by a cessation of grazing, which leads to habitat becoming unsuitable (Department of the Environment 2020). Habitat has also been lost through flood mitigation and river management, and through the planting of willows (Department of the Environment 2020). Agricultural and industrial pollution and invasive plants such as <em>Spartina anglica&#160;</em>may also lead to habitat degradation (Department of the Environment 2020).","Lane (1987) estimated the minimum number of individuals to be 12,450, based on the maximum observed simultaneous counts in New Zealand and Australia in the mid-1980s. The population of<em> C. b. exilis&#160;</em>in the Auckland Islands&#160;was estimated to number 730 birds in 1989 (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991). There is no more recent population data on this subspecies.<br/>Heather and Roberton (1996) estimated the population size to be c.50,000 individuals, based on banding studies, with c.30,000 (60%) wintering in Australia.&#160;Pierce (1999) considered that the population probably exceeded 50,000 individuals, based on estimates of the wintering population in Tasmania, data from breeding grounds and proportions of colour-banded individuals seen at non-breeding sites (Dowding and Moore 2006).<br/>During extensive surveys of estuaries around the New Zealand coast between 1983 and 1994, Sagar <em>et al.</em>&#160;(1999) counted a maximum of 9,242 birds during winter (with similar numbers reported in the North and South Islands), leading to a New Zealand winter population estimate of 10,843 individuals. The low counts were attributed to the lack of surveys inland, where large numbers overwinter. During similar winter coastal surveys in New Zealand from 1994 to 2003, total counts ranged from 2,759 to 6,296, with an average of 4,546 (Southey 2009). Winter population estimates of 5,083 - 7,335 between 1995 and 2004 were derived, with an estimate of 5,406 individuals for 2003 (Southey 2009). These figures were thought to represent underestimates of the true New Zealand wintering population, since some moderately important overwintering sites were not included in the surveys, but the total winter population in New Zealand was thought unlikely to be as high as 20,000 individuals (Southey 2009).<br/>The population in the Chatham Islands has been estimated to be around 200-300 individuals (Aikman and Miskelly 2004). <br/>Based on count data from&#160;2005/2006 to 2014/2015, the global population was estimated to be 13,057 individuals based on counts alone, 18,786 based on spatial extrapolations, and 19,559 based on range area and density estimates, with a final rounded population estimate of 19,000 (Hansen <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/>Counts of breeding individuals on braided rivers in the South Island New Zealand from&#160;1962–2017 recorded a total of&#160;12,730 birds (O'Donnell and Monks in press).<br/>The population size is here placed in the band 13,057 - 19,559 individuals, here rounded to 13,000 - 20,000 individuals. This is assumed to roughly equate to 8,705 - 13,039 mature individuals, here rounded to 8,000 - 14,000 mature individuals. The best estimate is 19,000 individuals (Hansen 2016), which is assumed to equate to 12,667 mature individuals, here rounded to 13,000 mature individuals.<br/>The number of subpopulations is not known. Although different parts of the population have different migration strategies, not all birds from an area migrate to the same wintering grounds, and there may be gene-flow between regions due to juvenile dispersal (J.

In Guatemala, 900 km<sup>2</sup> of cloud-forest remains, representing 3% of the original extent (Bubb 1991). Much of the remaining habitat in Chiapas has been altered by intense human use such as coppicing for charcoal production, timber extraction, farming, flower production, animal-grazing and subsistence wood-cutting (Wilson and Will 1997).

Human population in Guatemala increased by 35% between 1994 and 2002 and is estimated to double between 2010 and 2050 to a total of 28 million (INE 2002, CEPAL 2010). Most people live in the highlands with their favourable climate and fertile soils; human pressure on the habitat of this species is likely going to increase (K.

Breeding aggregations are almost exclusively on islands. On the mainland, especially inland, they nest singly. Ground nests have been recorded within strands of mangrove (Gallo Orsi <em>et al.</em> 2014), and some nests are lost to spring tide flooding (M. Jennings pers. comm.). The nest is a shallow depression scraped into the ground, almost always in a rock niche, or shaded by an overhang, or vegetation (Walter 1979; Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1988), but eggs can also be laid on bare rock (Walter 1979). Breeding is timed so that the provisioning of chicks coincides with the autumn migration of small birds. Tracked birds from Oman mostly departed in late October - early November. Birds arrive in their wintering grounds in Madagascar and south-east Africa from late October, but some stopover on the mainland before crossing the sea to Madagascar (Javed <em>et al.</em> 2012; Al Jahdhami <em>et al. </em>submitted). Migrants generally travel singly, or in pairs or small flocks (Brown <em>et al. </em>1982; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In the non-breeding season it seems to forage mostly for large insects over grassland and open country with trees and patches of agriculture. Small birds and lizards are also consumed (Walter 1979). Satellite tracking of an adult bird from UAE showed that it took 13 days to migrate to Madagascar, following an inland route of &gt;5,600 km and stopping over at three sites in East Africa with some shrub cover and fresh water (Javed <em>et al.</em> 2012). Tracked adult and juvenile birds from breeding sites in northern Oman took 32-62 days to migrate to Madagascar, and all used inland routes (Al Jahdhami <em>et al. </em>submitted).&#160;<br/><br/><br/><p></p>","Many of its breeding colonies are inaccessible or in protected areas. Historical breeding areas have been lost to development. Threats on migration and non-breeding areas are also active. Human disturbance may be a factor in some areas, including Bahrain's Hawar Islands (Kavanagh and King 2008), the Daymaniyat and Suwaydi Islands of Oman (McGrady <em>et al</em>. 2018, 2019), and Saudi Arabian Islands that are being developed.&#160;Increased pesticide use on the non-breeding ground has been suggested as a causal factor in the decline, but egg analysis indicates that it is at very low concentrations in these birds. Radio-tagging of birds in Oman suggested that only about 12&#160;% of fledglings survived to the average age of  first breeding, and that most of first-year mortality  occurred during the first migration or soon after they reached their&#160; non-breeding season destination. This low apparent survival of immature birds could result in low  recruitment to the breeding population, contributing to population declines (McGrady<em> et al.</em> 2016). Reduction in food availability due to declines in migratory small birds from breeding areas north of the species's distribution may affecting productivity and reducing breeding distribution. Lack of ecological and status data from throughout the year undermines conservation planning and implementation. This species may experience direct persecution in some countries, despite being legally protected in most countries in its range. The declines reported in Saudia Arabia by Gallo-Orsi <em>et al. </em>(2014) are thought to be caused by development of shrimp farms and the destruction of mangroves.<p></p>","Estimating the total population has proved notoriously difficult, partly due to lack of data, and the population may have been overestimated in the past (Kavanaugh and King 2008). Estimates of the total populations have ranged from 1,000-40,000 pairs, roughly equivalent to 2,000-80,000 mature individuals, and 3,000-120,000 individuals in total (Nicoll&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2008). However, there are now thought to be no more than a few thousand wintering in Madagascar and a review of all Arabian census data found that the total Arabian population is probably just below 500 breeding pairs (Jennings and Sadler 2006; F. Hawkins&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2007)<strong></strong>. Given that the Arabian population is generally regarded as the largest within its range (perhaps half of the world population), the estimate from Madagascar may indeed prove to be accurate (Jennings and Sadler 2006)<strong></strong>. Knowledge gaps about the population exist for inland areas of Egypt, Sudan, and Libya, and from the islands of the Dhalak Archipelago, Eritrea, and some Egyptian islands in the Red Sea. More recently, the draft International Single Species Action Plan for the species has provided clearer population estimates, with the breeding population estimated at 1,400-2,000 pairs (Gallo-Orsi&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014), equating to 2,800-4,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>This species is migratory and based on its wintering grounds and passage route it is assumed that all individuals have an opportunity to mix.

The species winters in tall coastal forests, with <em>fischeri</em> preferring coral rag forests, and <em>guttata</em> possibly using coastal dune forest, and this subspecies prefers larger forests for breeding (Harebottle 1994 <em>unpublished</em>,<em>&#160;</em>Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The species avoids disturbance-prone areas. It forages amongst the lower branches of leafy trees, on rotting logs and on the forest floor by scratching at leaf litter. It feeds on seeds, fruits, insects and their larvae, and land molluscs (Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. It has a home range of at least 0.14 ha (<strong></strong>Bennun 1985)<strong></strong> in the non-breeding season, while in the breeding season in South Africa, densities are typically 1 pair/ha, and the defended territory of a breeding pair is 0.5-1 ha when feeding (Chittenden 2005). Clutch-size is 2 for pairs in Malawi (Belcher 1930; Dowsett-Lemaire and&#160;Dowsett 2006), and 2-3 in South Africa (Chittenden 2005). Its nest is described as a cup or bowl constructed from vegetation, small twigs and mud, lined with plant material and feathers; the exact composition of materials is dependent on the habitat and thus differs between subspecies (Belcher 1930; Chittenden 2005; Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species does not conceal its nests well, and they tend to be very exposed and easy to find (Chittenden 2003, Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, leading to a low breeding success rate, with about 85% of nests recorded as failing by one observer in South Africa (Chittenden 2003)<strong></strong>. Nests may be re-used after a brood has fledged or even after the nest has been depredated, despite the clear indication that it is at risk. This may be a time- and energy-saving strategy (Chittenden 2003)<strong></strong>. Snakes, raptors and domestic cats are the main nest predators, and contribute to nearly 50% of breeding failures (Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Laying has been noted in November in Malawi (Dowsett-Lemaire and&#160;Dowsett, 2006) and in September-March in South Africa (Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005, Chittenden 2005)<strong></strong>. In 2019, this species was found breeding in Natal province by H. Chittenden (F. Dowsett-Lemaire, 2020, <em>pers. comm.</em>)<p></p>","In Tanzania, coastal forest patches are under heavy pressure and becoming increasingly fragmented. Pugu Forest is being degraded as a result of charcoal production (N. Burgess<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Wintering habitat in Kenya is also under heavy pressure, particularly the smaller sites (Waiyaki and Bennun 1999)<strong></strong>. In Malawi, the forest on Thyolo Mountain was completely destroyed c.2000 by illegal farming, and the small patch of forest on the adjacent Satemwa Tea Estate was cut down by the estate. The forest on Lisau Saddle had been destroyed by the 1990s by the Forestry Department, and the forest patch on Mount Soche was destroyed by illegal loggers shortly after the year 2000 (Dowsett-Lemaire <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; Dowsett-Lemaire &amp; Dowsett 2006; F. Dowsett-Lemaire 2020&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>).<br/><br/>At Mt Mulanje (Malawi) a&#160;large part of the forest on the southeastern slopes was destroyed by farmers, up to altitudes of 1,500 - 1,600m, but there remains a large block of forest on the upper southeastern slopes, and there is no encroachment into the Ruo Gorge on the southern slopes (F. Dowsett-Lemaire 2020&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>). At Mount Namuli, Mozambique, most of the forest has been destroyed in recent years (Dowsett-Lemaire 2010; Timberlake 2017). The forest at Mount Mabu is not seriously threatened at present (F. Dowsett-Lemaire, 2020, <em>pers. comm.</em>). In South Africa, mining has destroyed much wintering habitat and may affect more forest in the near future (T. B. Oatley <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, while habitat disturbance is increasing in many protected areas (Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>. The species's recovery is limited by its low breeding success, which is largely due to vulnerability of nests and resultant high rates of predation, perhaps exacerbated by domestic cats where they are present (Chittenden 2003, Ndang'ang'a <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. This species occasionally suffers mortality from collisions with skyscrapers, probably due to the disorientating effect of city lights during nocturnal migration (Harebottle 1994 <em>unpublished</em>,&#160;Oatley 2007)<strong></strong>. The species may suffer additional habitat loss due to climate change (D.

It is estimated that the population now falls in the band of 250-999 mature individuals.&#160;<br/><br/>As this species has 5 subspecies, and based on its distribution, it is assumed to have 5-6 subpopulations. The largest subpopulation is believed to be that of <em>G. g. guttata</em>, which based on its distribution in South Africa is believed to function as 1 subpopulation.

Therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It is a native-prairie specialist (Anstey <em>et al.</em> 1995)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, its breeding range restricted to short-grass and mixed-grass prairie regions, and its wintering range restricted to dry grasslands and deserts, where it feeds on grains in high density flocks (Hill and Gould 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It prefers native grasslands recently disturbed by fire, grazing or mowing, and will avoid nesting in areas protected from grazing or cultivated fields (Maher 1973, <strong></strong>Owens and Myres 1973)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;Critical habitat has been identified as open areas of upland native grassland &gt; 39 ha in fair to excellent range condition with flat to gently rolling topography and with limited woody vegetation or invasion by exotic grasses (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018, COSEWIC 2019, D. Hill <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>","As a result of conversion of native prairie to croplands and urban developments it has disappeared from much of its historical breeding range (e.g. in Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota); the species exhibits significantly lower nest survival and fledges fewer young in non-native grassland pastures compared to native prairies (Lloyd and Martin 2005, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Fragmentation of native grasslands reduces the suitability of breeding habitat (D. P. Hill and L. K. Gould&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016); a study in southern Saskatchewan found that the species did not use habitat patches &lt;39 ha (Davis 2004). Abundance, and nest fledging, success and productivity are reduced along roads (Sutter <em>et al</em>. 2000) and in close proximity to oil and gas wells (Ng 2017, Yoo and Koper 2017, Ng 2019, PCAP 2019). It exhibits delayed displacement (&gt;300 m) in response to wind energy infrastructure (Shaffer and Buhl 2015).&#160;Conversion of the species's wintering habitat to irrigated agriculture in Mexico also poses a threat (G. Butcher <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Recent conversion of grasslands to cropland in the Valles Centrales (the largest known wintering population of c.250,000 individuals) of Chihuahua, Mexico, is estimated to have displaced more than 130,000 wintering individuals (Pool <em>et al</em>. 2014). The wintering range has also contracted: this is presumed to have resulted from a population decline. Brown-headed cowbirds parasitise this species at low to moderate rates and there is a high level of predation by native predators (Hill and Gould 1997, Shaffer <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>. It can be vulnerable to disturbance (Hill and Gould 1997), and it has been reported killed at communication towers (Longcore <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;The species is also thought vulnerable to predicted drying as a result of climate change in the western part of its breeding range and in the wintering range (G. Butcher <em>in litt</em>. 2016), although Wilson <em>et al</em>.

A recovery strategy for the species has been proposed under the Species at Risk Act (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018). The plan involves protecting remaining native grassland, reducing further habitat fragmentation from roads and possibly restoring native prairies from existing cropland (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018). It has been the focus of a number of studies on the breeding grounds, but no species-specific management actions are in place.

However, the conservation status of the species is improving, with not only increases in the natural wild population but also establishment of reintroduced flocks that may become self-sustaining. As a result, the number of mature individuals is continuing to increase and this species may merit downlisting to Vulnerable in the near future.<p></p>","It breeds in prairie wetlands, preferring small, shallow lakes and ponds, willow communities, marshes, mudflats and perhaps sedge meadows, but this may be atypical considering its historical range (Archibald and Meine 1996, Timoney 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Eggs are laid from late April to mid-May (Archibald and Meine 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It winters in coastal brackish wetlands. For the wild population winter mortality appears to be correlated with blue crab availability at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, with higher mortality in years of lower crab abundance (Pugesek <em>et al. </em>2013). The natural population are known to feed on beetles, crabs/crayfish, vegetation, seeds, molluscs and other vertebrates with introduced populations thought to feed on largely the same sources alongside benthic invertebrates, and amphibians and reptiles (Dinets 2016, Caven <em>et al</em>. 2019, Neri 2020). Stopover sites typically comprise wetland land-cover types and lowland grasslands (Baasch <em>et al</em>. 2019).<p></p>","Over-hunting, habitat conversion and human disturbance were the main causes of the species's decline. Currently, the most significant known cause of death or injury to fledglings is collision with powerlines (Lewis 1997)<strong></strong>. Powerline markers can reduce collisions by 50-80%, but most powerlines remain unmarked and collision is a major and growing problem (Lewis 1997, Folk <em>et al. </em>2013); 45 powerline collision-related mortalities were recorded between 1956-2006 (Stehn and Wassenich 2008, Smith 2019<strong></strong>. The anticipated placement of thousands of wind turbines in the migration corridor will decrease availability of crane stopover habitat and may also dramatically increase the number of powerlines (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Increases in the number of powerlines also stems from increased oil and gas exploration along parts of the species's migration corridor whilst activity and traffic associated with drilling may also be of significant detriment (Niemuth <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2007, a lightning strike during severe weather killed 17 captive-bred young  birds being housed in a top-netted release pen in Florida (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Eggs and pre-fledged chicks are subject to predation by various birds and mammals including raven, bald eagle, wolf, black bear and lynx (CWS and USFWS 2007), while harassment of nesting individuals by parasites such as black flies can lead to nest abandonment, and this has been proposed as a key reason for failed breeding in one of the introduced populations (Runge <em>et al. </em>2011, Barzen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Drought is a serious threat to the species as it is detrimental to all habitats utilized by this species, but is especially harmful by dramatically decreasing production on the nesting grounds (RENEW report 1999, Butler <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong></strong>. In early 2009, a prolonged drought and reduced water inflow to coastal wetlands led to a reduction in availability of blue crabs <span class=""st""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Callinectes sapidus</span> and wolfberries <em>Lycium spp. </em>(important food items), causing Whooping Crane mortality rates to double (Archibold 2009). Drought, and alteration and destruction of natural wetlands and rivers impacts roosting and foraging sites during migration (Niemuth <em>et al</em>. 2018, Baasch <em>et al</em>. 2019) whilst coastal development, sea level rise, climate change, chemical spills, reduced fresh water inflows, and human disturbance threaten the Texan wintering grounds (RENEW report 1999, CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong>. Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) can only support a maximum of 500 birds through the winter (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong> and falls short of the initial downlisting target of 1,000 birds. Continued population growth may force some cranes in future to use disturbed and suboptimal habitat (M. Reid <em>in litt.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Much of the currently unoccupied crane habitat at Aransas where the cranes would be expected to expand into is being threatened with construction of houses (T. Stehn, <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. There are currently concerns about oil spills and river inflows to Aransas NWR (CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong>, as well as reduced water flows in the central Platte River Ralley, Nebraska, a key stopover site for migrating Whooping Cranes (Chavez-Ramirez 2008). The spread of West Nile virus and avian influenza in the future may pose a threat to the species (Chu <em>et al. </em>2003)<strong></strong>.  The long-term effects of genetic drift after a severe population bottleneck are unknown (Glenn <em>et al.</em> 1999, Smith 2019)<strong></strong> There have been incidences of illegal shooting of the species and it is known to be an increasing threat with 27 confirmed shooting mortalities between 1967 and 2016 (MacKenzie 2011, Shaw 2011, Condon <em>et al</em>. 2018, Niemuth <em>et al</em>. 2018, Smith 2019).<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><p></p></span>","The total population in the wild numbers c.483 individuals. However, the only self-sustaining population breeding in Northwest Territories/Alberta, Canada and wintering in Texas, USA numbers 329 individuals, fewer than 250 of which are mature. Hence we retain a precautionary estimate of 50-249 mature individuals. Despite this however, the latest evidence from the Crane Conservation Strategy (Smith 2019) suggests that both the self-sustaining Aransas-Wood Buffalo population and additional reintroduced populations have increased notably in recent years and that the current population estimate may now be a considerable underestimate.",Increasing,"<em>Grus americana</em> declined from historic estimates of &gt;10,000 prior to European settlement of North America to 1,300-1,400 birds by 1870, and only 15 adults in 1938 (CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong>. As of 2016/17 there are four wild populations totalling c.483 individuals, including three reintroduced populations in the eastern U.S. that are not yet self-sustaining. The only natural wild population breeds in Wood Buffalo National Park, on the border of Northwest Territories and Alberta, <strong>Canada</strong>, and winters at and near to Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Texas, <strong>U.S.A.</strong> (Meine and Archibald 1996) (although in 2011-2012 they were observed up to hundreds of kilometres away from here [Wright <em>et al. </em>2014]).

As of winter 2015-2016 this population contained 329 individuals, including 122 adult pairs (Butler and Harrell 2016). A reintroduced, non-migratory flock in Florida numbered c.41 individuals in 2007, but due to lack of reproductive success and high mortality rates this project was discontinued in 2007 (T. Stehn <em>in litt. </em>2007, W. Harrell <em>in litt. </em>2016). This population contains a dozen or less individuals (H. Ray <em>in litt. </em>2016). A separate reintroduced flock migrates between Wisconsin and south-eastern USA. This population numbered 75 birds in 2007 (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, increasing to c.90 birds in 2008 (Stehn 2008), and as of January 2017 the population numbers 104 individuals (Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership 2017).

A U.S. District Court has ruled to restrict water offtake from the Guadalupe River, Texas, as so much water was being taken it was a breach of the Endangered Species Act against this species (Beilfuss 2013). There is an international recovery plan (CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong> focusing on increasing the size of the natural flock, establishing additional wild populations through experimental releases, teaching captive-bred birds to migrate (Lewis 1995, Line 1995, RENEW report 1999)<strong></strong>, and increasing the captive population for experimental releases and ecological research (e.g. habitat selection). Considerable progress has been made in improving the genetic health of captive stock and in breeding under-represented genetic strains, but delayed reproduction in captivity and the failure of some pairs to breed at all has slowed down progress (Putman 2007)<strong></strong>. In the past, recruitment was increased in certain years in Canada by removal of a single egg from two-egg broods (Boyce <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>; the removed eggs are used to supplement captive flocks, but the overall impact of the egg pickup program is largely undetermined (<strong></strong>CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong>.

Successful conservation action has now reversed such declines and the species is observed to be increasing throughout both&#160;its largest extant population in&#160;Los Haitises National Park and additional reintroduced populations. If population increases continue, it may be eligible for a downlist in the near future.<p></p> <p></p>","The species has been recorded up to 2,000 m above sea level in a variety of undisturbed forest-types including rainforest, subtropical dry and moist forests, pine forest, limestone karst forest and marshland. It is often seen in secondary and agricultural habitats (Wiley and Wiley 1981) and appears to be attracted forest edges and human-inhabited areas (T. Hayes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Prey in the Los Haitises consists primarily of reptiles (with lizards, in particular <em>Celestus</em> skinks [Woolaver <em>et al</em>. 2013c], and snakes comprising 80% of the diet)&#160;and frogs. They occasionally prey on birds, small mammals (bats and rodents) and centipedes (Woolaver 2011). Nests have been found in the crowns of tall endemic trees, with Royal Palms <em>Roystonea hispaniolana</em> particularly favoured (Woolaver 2005, 2006, 2011;&#160;Gesto 2018). Nest-building occurs in December-June and eggs are laid in January-June&#160;(Wiley and Wiley 1981, T. Hayes unpubl. data)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The clutch size is 1-3 eggs. Pairs have successfully fledged three young, but more typically one or two. Males are known to participate in incubation. Disturbance by humans is sometimes a cause of nest failure (Woolaver 2011). The home range of three adjacent breeding pairs was just c.60 ha (Wiley and Wiley 1981)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>","Large-scale habitat loss due to clearing of forest for agriculture and pasture for livestock, as well as direct persecution have been major factors in this species's decline (Thorstrom 2004)<strong></strong>. Even within Los Haitises National Park, slash and burn agriculture is widespread; virtually all primary forest within the park has now been destroyed, and the remaining secondary fragments are being cleared at a rapid rate&#160;(Dirección Nacional de Parques 1991, Brothers 1997, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018). A study of nest success from 2005-2009 found that of 216 nests monitored, only 40% were successful, with the majority of nest failures caused by human disturbance, including burning or cutting of nest trees, poaching or intentional killing of eggs/nestlings, and rocks and sticks thrown at the nest&#160;(Woolaver&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Local people still regard the species as a serious threat to poultry,&#160;so The Peregrine Fund now has a program to provide small chicken cages to local subsistence farmers so that they can protect their young chickens from depredation.<br/><br/>Significant causes of natural mortality are poor weather (rain lasting over several days when nestlings are less than one week old), collapse of nests and infestations of the parasitic bot fly <em>Philornis pici</em>&#160;(The Peregrine Fund 2014);&#160;<em>Philornis pici</em>&#160;causes high mortality in nestling hawks (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018) and has also occasionally been recorded infecting adult nesting hawks (Quiroga <em>et al</em>. 2020). Infestation of nestlings by <em>Philornis</em> spp. is prevalent, some years affecting almost 90% of Ridgway’s Hawk nests and the odds of a nestling surviving to fledge decrease dramatically with infestation (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018, Bulgarella <em>et al</em>. 2019). Electrocution on power poles is a also a significant threat in urban and suburban areas. In the Punta Cana release area over 200 power poles have been retrofitted to prevent electrocution, a joint effort between The Peregrine Fund and Grupo Puntacana (Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2019, T. Hayes unpubl. data). Woolaver <em>et al</em>. (2013a) detected a weak but consistent sex ratio bias towards female nestlings, which could give cause for concern in the future. Inbreeding within the small population also poses a threat (Woolaver <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<p></p>","This species has an extremely small and fragmented population, which was previously in steep decline, with a 21% reduction in breeding pairs from 2006-2009, and as few as 109 breeding pairs in 2009 (Woolaver 2011). In 2014 The Peregrine Fund recorded 120 territorial pairs in Los Haitises and two pairs in Punta Cana (The Peregrine Fund 2014). In 2016 they recorded 120 territorial pairs in Los Haitises and 12 pairs in Punta Cana (T. Hayes&#160;unpubl. data). In 2019, The Peregrine Fund recorded 142 pairs of Ridgway’s Hawks in Los Haitises and 19 pairs in Punta Cana. These 19 pairs of hawks successfully produced 17 fledglings in 2019 and two additional young were fostered into nests in Punta Cana. Additionally, some areas in Los Haitises are not being consistently monitored, however we know that some pairs of hawks continue to exist outside the monitored area. The total number of Ridgway’s Hawks is estimated at a minimum of 427 individuals and 322 mature individuals.",Increasing,"This species occurs in the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>. It formerly also occurred in Haiti, with historical reports from the adjacent Haitian islands of Gonâve, the Cayemite Islands where it was reportedly common in 1934, Île-à-Vache where it was reportedly common in 1962 (Wiley and Wiley 1981) but is now likely extirpated (Brooks and Dávalos 2001), and in the Dominican islands of Isla Beata and Alto Velo.&#160;Recent surveys on Petite Cayemite Island and Grand Cayemite Island, <strong>Haiti</strong> report the first sightings of Ridgway’s Hawks there since 1918 (Wetmore and Swales 1931, Brooks and Davalos 2001). In August 2019, Haitian biologist Anderson Jean saw two Ridgway’s Hawks (one juvenile, one of unknown sex/age) on Petite Cayemite. In January 2020, Thomas Hayes (The Peregrine Fund) and Anderson Jean again reported two Ridgway’s Hawks (one adult female, one no confirmation on sex/age) on Petite Cayemite. Additionally, surveys during the same expedition found one adult female Ridgway’s Hawk on the adjacent island of Grande Cayemite (T. Hayes&#160;unpubl. data). There is a single record from the island of Culebra off Puerto Rico (to U.S.A.) (Raffaele&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998). It was formerly widespread, but has been extirpated from over 96% of its original range during the last century (Woolaver 2011). There have been very few recent records outside Los Haitises National Park (S. Latta <em>in litt.</em> 1998). It was also recorded in human-modified habitat on the Samaná Peninsula in 2003 (Thorstrom <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species has been reported from Isla Beata and Valle Nuevo in 1981 (Wiley and Wiley 1981); both sites have not been surveyed significantly since then and confirmation of its status at these two sites is a priority.&#160;<br/><br/>A new population is being established through releases of young birds at Puntacana Resort and Club, a private land holding in south-east Dominican Republic (The Peregrine Fund 2014, McClure <em>et al. </em>2017). The first birds were released here in 2009. One pair successfully bred in 2013 and fledged the first known wild-hatched young outside of Los Haitises National Park (The Peregrine Fund <em>in prep.</em>). In 2016, there were 12 recorded territorial pairs in Punta Cana, of which five pairs were successful in fledging 8 young (The Peregrine Fund <em>in prep.</em>). The Peregrine Fund was also establishing a new population in the private reserve of Loma la Herradura by translocating individuals from the Los Haitises National Park (Thorstrom 2008); however, releases were suspended in 2013 due to high mortality of released hawks caused by human persecution (The Peregrine Fund 2014).&#160;In 2019, The Peregrine Fund released 25 juvenile Ridgway’s Hawks in Aniana Vargas National Park, with plans to continue releases until a population is established (T. Hayes <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway&#160;</strong><br/>Effective protection of the&#160;Ridgway’s Hawk population in Los Haitises (currently the largest extant population).&#160;Most Ridgway’s Hawk pairs occur within Los Haitises, but this site is poorly protected and evidence suggests that it has been mainly deforested (Dirección Nacional de Parques 1991, Brothers 1997). Additionally, political structure in the Dominican Republic makes lasting changes to park rules and regulations difficult and the park boundary has changed several times, from 208 km<sup>2</sup> in 1976 to 1600 km<sup>2</sup> in 1992. Currently, Los Haitises is about 600 km<sup>2</sup> (Dominican Law: Ley 202-04). Ongoing conservation action in the park is essential for the continued growth of <em>B. ridgwayi</em>&#160;populations within its boundaries and should conservation action cease, the ongoing population increased observed may well slow, or even revert to declines.<br/>Improvement of reproductive success through treatment of Ridgway’s Hawk nests to prevent nest fly parasitism of nestlings by <em>Philornis</em> spp. The primary focus of Ridgway’s Hawk nest management is to prevent nestling mortality caused by parasitic nest flies of the genus <em>Philornis</em>. Treatment of nests and/or nestlings has resulted in a 179% increase in the probability that a nestling will successfully fledge into the wild (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2018). Should nest treatments for&#160;<em>Philornis</em>&#160;spp. cease however, reproductive rates would likely drop considerably as anywhere between 0.19-0.65 nestlings are common per pair in untreated nests, compared to 1.2-1.65 nestlings per pair in treated nests (T. Hayes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Intensive research of Ridgway’s Hawk breeding ecology and conservation genetics are part of an ongoing study initiated in 2005, and annual surveys monitor the hawk population within Los Haitises (The Peregrine Fund 2014). Through intensive management of nests in Los Haitises, The Peregrine Fund is increasing productivity of wild pairs from 2 -4 fold (Hayes et al. 2018, T. Hayes unpubl. data). These actions are simultaneously bolstering the wild population of Ridgway’s Hawk in Los Haitises as well as allowing for the removal of some wild nestlings for translocation and release in regions where the species is native, but has been extirpated.<br/>The creation of at least three Ridgway’s Hawk populations outside of Los Haitises. The Ridgway’s Hawk population decline measured by Woolaver from 2005 – 2009 has been reversed and the Ridgway’s Hawk population in Los Haitises is now growing (Woolaver 2011, T. Hayes&#160;unpubl. data). In some areas that The Peregrine Fund is working (specifically in Los Limones, Los Haitises NP), the number of Ridgway’s Hawk nesting pairs has almost doubled since 2011. The Ridgway’s Hawk population is increasing in the other areas of the park as well (T. Hayes<em>&#160;</em>unpubl. data). The Peregrine Fund has focused their conservation effort on the management of nests in Los Haitises as well as the translocation of wild Ridgway’s Hawk nestlings for reintroduction into areas where the species has been extirpated. Captive breeding programs, while useful in some situations can drain limited resources away from the protection of wild populations. In 2008 and 2009, The Peregrine Fund began translocating nestling Ridgway’s Hawks from Los Haitises to two distinct sites, Loma la Herradura private reserve and Punta Cana (Thorstrom 2008, The Peregrine Fund 2014, McClure <em>et al</em>. 2017). From 2008 – 2012, 20 young hawks were released near the town of Pedro Sanches, Dominican Republic. Releases at this site were discontinued after 2012 because of high mortality due to human persecution. From 2009 – 2019, a total of 130 birds were released at Punta Cana, Dominican Republic of which the majority became independent, no longer relying on provisioned food (The Peregrine Fund 2014). In 2013, released birds in Punta Cana produced the first nestling ever recorded in the region. There were two breeding pairs the following year and the small population increased incrementally to 19 territorial pairs and 17 wild young fledged in 2019. Two additional nestlings were fostered from destroyed nests in Los Haitises to nests in Punta Cana for a total of 19 young hawks fledged in the wild in Punta Cana in 2019. As of 2019, 49 wild young have fledged in Punta Cana from wild nests (T. Hayes&#160;unpubl. data). In 2019, The Peregrine Fund began releasing Ridgway’s Hawks in Aniana Vargas National Park. This small park was created in 2009 and is approximately 130 km<sup>2</sup>. Habitat in this area is recovering from intensive agriculture and has undergone changes in recent decades to less intensive farming methods, primarily shade-covered cacao plantations.<br/>Education campaign to spread awareness of the ecological and economic benefits of Ridgway’s Hawk and to assist local people in the protection of their young chickens from depredation by hawks. A benefit of management of Ridgway’s Hawk populations within Los Haitises is that local individuals are able to carry out the fieldwork. This means that people in communities around the hawk population are invested in the conservation of the species. In 2005 by The Peregrine Fund initiated a publicity campaign to raise awareness of the Ridgway’s Hawk within local communities near hawk populations (Woolaver 2006) and environmental education continues in Los Haitises and in areas where the hawks have been reintroduced. In order to reduce direct human-caused Ridgway's Hawk mortality, The Peregrine Fund began an intensive environmental education program in Dominican Republic in 2013. In the first two years, the environmental education program engaged with over 1,168 individuals in communities around Punta Cana (The Peregrine Fund 2014). The Peregrine Fund is currently working with over 50 communities around established Ridgway's Hawk territories and areas where the Ridgway’s Hawk has been reintroduced, and have reached over 13,500 people through direct efforts since the start of the program. Environmental education activities have been ongoing, and include community and door-to-door visits, public presentations, school visits, celebrations of Ridgway's Hawk Day, as well as teacher training workshops revolved around environmental education and the conservation of raptors. Additionally, other project partners including Propagas Foundation, Grupo Puntacana Foundation, and Zoodom (Santo Domingo Zoo) have all taken an active role in increasing awareness of Ridgway’s Hawk (Marta Curti pers. comm.). Local populations must continue to be involved in conservation projects to prevent reversion to practices that result in high <em>B. ridgwayi</em>&#160;mortality.<br/>CITES Appendix II. The risk of electrocution on power poles is high for Ridgway’s Hawks in urban and suburban areas within the Dominican Republic. In 2014, 33% of young hawks in the Punta Cana region were electrocuted. The Peregrine Fund and Grupo Punta Cana have been working together to retrofit over 200 power poles to prevent electrocutions of Ridgway’s Hawk as well as other wildlife. Retrofitting of power poles to prevent electrocution is an ongoing effort and has dramatically improved survival in the Punta Cana region (in 2017 only one of 25 released hawks was electrocuted [Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2019, T. Hayes unpubl. data]).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed&#160;</strong><br/>Ensure the de facto protection of remaining habitat in Los Haitises National Park. Continue and expand education and awareness campaigns to reduce direct persecution, including campaigning for a 'Ridgway's Hawk Day' to become a national holiday in the Dominican Republic (The Peregrine Fund 2014). Continue monitoring, nest management, and banding work (The Peregrine Fund 2014).&#160;Survey remaining forest fragments adjacent to Los Haitises National Park, as well as historical sites that have not experienced significant habitat loss.&#160;Assess potential sites for future relocation to establish additional populations within secure habitat. Ensure that translocated nestlings are genetically diverse (Woolaver <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Evaluate the threat posed by power lines and retrofit them where necessary in potential release areas (The Peregrine Fund 2014). Continue research into methods to reduce <em>Philornis pici</em> infestations. Recent sightings of Ridgway’s Hawk in Haiti reopen the possibility that conservation efforts in these locations may be warranted.<p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Expanding Merlin populations, a primary predator of the Piping Plover, in the Great Lakes region are also thought to be a significant threat to the species's population viability and by incorporating an index of Merlin abundance, the quasi-extinction probability (less than or equal to 15 breeding pairs remaining) is now estimated as ~12% over a 10-year period (Saunders <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018).<p></p>","The latest census data recorded 4,016 (2019) mature individuals on the Atlantic coast, ~3,500 on the northern Great Plains and Prairies (2016), and 147 in the Great Lakes (2014-18) (USFWS 2020; USFWS&#160;<em>unpubl. data</em>; B. Andres <em>in litt</em>. 2020); totaling 7,663 breeding individuals. The Great Plains/prairies population is however liable to fluctuations and remains under-surveyed, hence its true total may be greater. Partners in Flight (2019) therefore estimate the total population to number 8,400 mature individuals and as a result, the population is placed here between 7,600-8,400 mature individuals, equivalent to a population of c.11,500-12,500 individuals in total.",Increasing,"<em>Charadrius melodus</em> breeds in the <strong>U.S.A. </strong>and <strong>Canada</strong>.

The recent, apparent decline in the prairies/Great Plains largely reflects the population's fluctuating nature in response to wet-dry cycles and a lack of surveyed sites leaving individuals unrecorded; numbers in this population are similar to the&#160;average of the past five surveys (3,320 plovers, 1991–2011), hence it is considered stable. Overall populations increased by ~70% between 1991 and 2011 and despite local fluctuations and a recent slowdown in the rate of increase, populations are considered to be stable or in a slow increase.

There were censuses in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 (Plissner and Haig 1997; J. H. Plissner <em>in litt.</em> 1999) and censuses have continued since. It is considered Endangered in U.S.A. and Canada. There is a recovery plan for Atlantic coast breeders (USFWS 1996b; A. Hecht <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. The Novia Scotia Piping Plover Conservation Program uses monitoring and site protection to aid species recovery in Nova Scotia, Canada (Abbott 2008). Predator management has increased hatching success (D. Amirault <em>in litt.</em> 1999; A. Hecht <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Seasonal restrictions and public education have limited disturbance (Hecht 1995; A. Hecht <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Measures to protect breeding and wintering beaches are having mixed results; $3 million per year is being spent in Atlantic U.S.A. alone on numerous management measures (nest exclosures, beach stewards etc. [B. Andres <em>in litt</em>. 2020]), and this will need to be kept up indefinitely. Nature Canada filed a lawsuit in 2006 against the Canadian Environment Ministry for failing to take necessary measures under the Species at Risk Act, which resulted in a revised recovery plan with critical habitat identified. The Great Lakes population is supplemented by captively bred individuals (Roche <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008), and also utilises nest exclosures and beach stewards (S. Saunders <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed 255 ha of sandbar habitat on the Missouri River, USA, between 2004 to 2009 however, whilst exhibiting some success, it was shown to exhibit considerably lower nest success, pre-fledging chick survival and hatch-year survival than sandbar habitat created through natural flood processes (Hunt <em>et al</em>. 2018). Effective habitat creation should however, be viewed as an essential action in increasing Piping Plover populations as Robinson <em>et al</em>. (2019) observed that populations appear to be at carrying-capacity and are habitat limited, yet expanded significantly following increases in natural habitat availability. The Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP) and its partners have invested considerable resources in generating and managing off-channel nesting habitat for Piping Plovers (<em>Charadrius melodus</em>) along the central Platte River in Nebraska; measures implemented to increase nest and brood survival at nesting sites include: tree removal, water barrier&#160;construction around&#160;nesting areas, predator fence installation, and predator trapping (Farrell <em>et al</em>. 2018). Both nest success and brood success were recorded at 75% in this area, thus it is concluded that such habitat management techniques are sufficient in maintaining high levels of productivity in Piping Plover populations along the central Platte River (Farrell <em>et al</em>. 2018). Furthermore, following the discovery of a large wintering population of Piping Plovers in Joulter Cays, Bahamas, the Bahamian government included the area when designating an additional 113,920 acres of protected land in September 2015 (Saha 2015).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Determine the importance of north-west Mexico for wintering birds.

Fotso<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. It feeds mainly on invertebrates (Brosset and Erard 1986)<strong></strong>, is a strong follower of ant columns, and also takes small vertebrates, primarily frogs and lizards (Thompson and Fotso 2000; Bian <em>et al. </em>2006; French 2006)<strong></strong>. Additionally, it commonly feeds on a variety of invertebrates such as grasshoppers, beetles, weevils, earthworms, slugs and snails (Bian <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. It is recorded at 45-2,100 m in Cameroon (Butynski <em>et al. </em>1996)<strong></strong> but at 250-900 m on Bioko. It nests in caves and on rock-faces and cliffs (although there is a recent report of a nest in the buttress of a large <em>Piptadeniastrum</em> tree [<strong></strong>Waltert and Mühlenberg 2000; Bian <em>et al. </em>2006]<strong></strong>) and appears to have very specific breeding habitat requirements, including overhanging rock to protect the nest from rain, and sheer rock and often a seasonal river below to protect it from predators (<strong></strong>Tye 1987; Dowsett-Lemaire 2007)<strong></strong>. It has also been recorded nesting under concrete bridges in Lopé National Park, Gabon (Christy and Maisels 2007)<strong></strong>. It breeds colonially where nest-sites are limited (<strong></strong>Tye 1987), with home ranges of less than 0.5km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Awa II <em>et al. </em>2009). The nest is a half-cup of dried mud impregnated with dry grass fibres and dead leaves, in which it lays one to three, but usually two, eggs (Bian <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. The incubation period is 21-24 days and the fledging period is about 24 days (Bian <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. In the Dja Reserve, southern Cameroon, nesting occurs between August and October, with activity peaking in September (French 2006)<strong></strong>, however nesting occurs more widely from March to November in the country, with the peak in August-November (Bian <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong></strong>.   <p></p>","<p>It remains threatened by forest clearance and increasing human disturbance throughout much of its range, and at many sites in Cameroon survives only in poor quality habitat (Thompson and Fotso 1995; Atuo <em>et al.</em> 2016). Forest clearance takes place for agriculture, largely crop fields and cocoa plantations (T. Awa<em> in litt</em>. 2007; R. Fotso<em> in litt</em>. 2007). In many non-protected areas where the species occurs, in Cameroon for example, disturbance is caused by activities such as logging and slash-and-burn agriculture (Bian <em>et al. </em>2006; Awa II&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009b). In protected areas, encroachment by farmers, hunters and loggers means that these populations are also under threat; and hunters' camps can also disturb the species and lead to abandoned breeding in addition to the removal of eggs and young (Atuo <em>et al. </em>2014). <br/>In Gabon and Bioko, there is only minimal habitat loss and the species is unlikely to be affected by human activity in the near future, as in these parts of its range it inhabits extremely rugged and inaccessible areas. Adults may be hunted to a limited extent for trade and, on Mt Kupe and the Ebo forest at least, it is often caught in spring-traps set for mammals (Bian <em>et al. </em>2006; R. Fotso<em> in litt</em>. 2007; R. Whytock <em>in litt.</em> 2012). <br/>The lack of suitable breeding sites, particularly of suitable rocks, may also partly account for its scarcity. However, work in the Ebo forest, Cameroon has shown that nest site availability may not always be a limiting factor for <em>P. oreas</em> populations (Whytock unpubl. data. 2012). Abandoned nests can remain unused for many years on suitable rock faces and population estimates may be unreliable where densities are are derived from nest counts (R. Whytock <em>in litt.</em> 2012). In addition, cannibalism and predation probably contribute to low breeding success (Brosset and Erard 1986; Bian <em>et al. </em>2006). For example, low nests in Korup are known to be destroyed by chimpanzees <em>Pan troglodytes</em> and drills <em>Papio leucophaeus </em>(Bian <em>et al. </em>2006). Disturbance resulting from human visits to breeding sites, especially by birdwatchers within the growing ecotourism sector, is becoming a major concern and it can lead to disproportionate effects on breeding success if safe viewing regimes are not put in place (T. Awa<em> in litt</em>. 2007, Awa <em>et al. </em>2009b).</p><p></p>","The total population is almost certainly less than 10,000 mature individuals (C. Bowden<em> in litt.</em> 1999; R.

Only at a handful of sites actively managed for the species and where there is no exploitation is the species expected to persist. In addition, lowland forest is being lost at a moderate to rapid rate throughout the range. As such it is assessed as Critically Endangered. Reductions are expected to continue although the concentration of the remaining population in the protected sites may result in a slowing of the rate over the next three generations.&#160;&#160;<p></p>","It inhabits lowland and hill rainforest, up to at least 1,065 m, and man-modified habitats when travelling to coastal nesting grounds. It nests communally, which is hypothesised to be an evolutionary strategy for satiating natural egg predators <strong></strong>(Gorog <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>2005), at traditional sites, typically sandy beaches, lakeshores and riverbanks. Females lay 8-12 eggs in pits, heated by solar and/or geothermal radiation, over a 2-3 month period, peaking markedly at some localities during the regionally variable dry season.  The eggs (averaging 16% of adult female body weight) comprise 61-64% yolk, and when laid are left to incubate (for 2-3 months) and hatch with no further parental support.  The young take up to c.2 days to tunnel to the surface after hatching, emerging ready to fly. <p></p>","Unsustainable harvesting of eggs combined with human disturbance of nesting grounds has caused the abandonment of many nesting colonies and remains the major threat to those remaining. Forest destruction and fragmentation increasingly threaten surviving populations; there is a strong relationship between abandonment and connectivity of nesting grounds and forests, with an increase in abandonment associated with decreased connectivity <strong></strong>(Gorog <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005). In 2000, and again in 2004, forest fires impacted the Tangkoko DuaSaudara Nature Reserve, damaging 180 ha and 130 ha respectively, and resulted in areas of dense regrowth impenetrable to Maleo (van As 2007). Logging and agricultural, urban and road developments have isolated virtually all coastal nesting grounds from non-breeding habitats, significantly elevating the risk of mortality and natural predation of chicks. In the Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park and surrounding area habitats continue to be degraded, the major threats being rattan and timber collection, conversion of forest to agricultural land, gold-mining <strong></strong>(M. Argeloo <em>in litt.</em> 2005), hunting of adult birds for sport <strong></strong>(G. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 2004), and the spread of invasive vegetation. An increase in the human population has exacerbated many of the threatening processes above and leads to the introduction of invasive predators such as dogs and rats. Nest site abandonment is highest in coastal and non-protected areas: this, the level of awareness raised about this species and the wealth of information now available suggest there is considerable scope for protecting Maleo. <p></p>","The total population is estimated to number 4,000-7,000 breeding pairs (Butchart &amp; Baker 2000), equivalent to 8,000-14,000 mature individuals or 12,000-21,000 individuals in total. Despite numerous research projects at multiple nesting grounds since, a coordinated resurvey has only recently been undertaken which initial findings appear to confirm the continuation of a rapid decline (Alliance for Tompotika Conservation 2018).Very few nesting sites are considered secure: intact, connected to forest habitat and safe from egg collection (Dekker 1990). Where there is long-term conservation commitment numbers of individuals can increase rapidly: at Taima&#160;<br/>The key areas holding the largest proportions of the population are the 'Bogani Landscape' around Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park plus Tanjung Dako and Tanjung Matop areas along the coast in North Sulawesi (Argeloo 1994, Butchart &amp; Baker 2000, Gorog <em>et al. </em>2005), while in Central Sulawesi key sites are Lore Lindu National Park (Butchart &amp; Baker 2000), Morowali Nature Reserve and nearby Sungai Bosu, and three sites on the eastern peninsular (Bakiriang, Libuun and Pintu Kubur) in Central Sulawesi (Butchart &amp; Baker 2000).&#160;<br/><br/>Most information pertains to sites in the 'Bogani Landscape' in North Sulawesi. Here, 50% of known nesting grounds (18/36) were assessed as having been abandoned by 2003, and five of the 27 sites also assessed in 1990-1991 had been active at that time (Gorog <em>et al. </em>2005). Six further nesting grounds were predicted to have a high likelihood of abandonment in the near future (Gorog <em>et al. </em>2005). One of these sites, Tanjung Binereang, has been the subject of a significant conservation project involving the creation of a private locally-owned reserve that has been successful at preventing abandonment (Clements 2009). Sites within protected areas were more likely to persist and in the absence of direct intervention through guarding the nesting grounds abandonment was likely: 17/26 nesting grounds in non-protected areas assessed in 2003 had already been abandoned and of the remainder 6 were 'Severely Threatened' and two (adjacent to each other) were threatened (Gorog <em>et al. </em>2005).<br/><br/>Numbers of individuals is difficult to assess, as pairs arrive intermittently at the breeding ground and females lay their estimated annual clutch of 8-12 eggs&#160; (Dekker 1990) over a variable time period. At Saluki, one of the main nesting grounds in Lore Lindu National Park, 162 mature individuals were estimated from maximum monthly number of eggs laid during a 6-month study in 2015, contrasted with an estimate of 325-650 for the site in 2001 (Yanto Samana 2015). However Butchart &amp; Baker (2000) roughly estimated 10-50 pairs at the site in 2000, 20-100 mature individuals. Both works indicate a strong decrease has occurred, evidenced by the dramatic reduction in numbers of eggs harvested from over 30 daily in the early 1980s to only 1-2 a day by 1999 (Butchart &amp; Baker 2000). Action to conserve this population has clearly prevented the abandonment of the site (Yanto Samana 2015).",Decreasing,"<em>Macrocephalon maleo</em> is endemic to Sulawesi and Buton Islands, <strong>Indonesia</strong> (Prawiradilaga 1997, Dekker <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2000, BirdLife International 2001). Of 149 nesting grounds considered to be active within the past three generations (since 1983), only 47 are currently considered active (Summers <em>et al. </em>in prep.). At least 33 additional sites have become abandoned but the timing is uncertain (M. Summers <em>in litt. </em>2021). Consequently the species is suspected to have been lost from significant parts of the previously occupied range. The rapid decline was already noted by the start of the 2000s (Butchart &amp; Baker 2000, Baker 2002, Gorog <em>et al. </em>2005).

It has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972. The species was included in a status survey and 2000-2004 conservation action plan for Megapodes. Nesting ground surveys were made in North, Central and South East Sulawesi between 1990 and 2000. Over 50% of known nesting grounds (chiefly inland sites) are located inside protected areas, the most important being Lore Lindu National Park, Morowali Nature Reserve, and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park. Effective conservation programmes have been implemented at the Tambun and Hungayono nesting grounds, where hatchery projects and improved guard patrolling have led to greatly increased hatching rates, at Taima (Libuun) near Tompotika in Central Sulawesi, and at the Pakuli/Saluki complex at Lore <a style=""mso-comment-reference: MS_1;mso-comment-date:20131015T1730"">Lindu</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160; and the Tanjung Matop near Toli-toli (D. Neville <em>in litt.</em> 2004, M. Summers <em>in litt</em>. 2006). At the nesting ground in Libuun, Tompotika, Central Sulawesi, the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation (AlTo) has partnered with the village of Taima since 2006 to provide year-round protection for Maleos (M. Summers <em>in litt</em>. 2012). The project employs teams of permanent local staff and villagers to guard the nesting ground and record data. AlTo also provides community benefits to the village for its participation in the project, as well as an ongoing Outreach and Awareness campaign promoting Maleo conservation in schools and villages throughout the Tompotika area and in the city of Luwuk, where it has received government endorsement. Since the project began in 2006, all poaching has essentially ended at Libuun, and the number of adult Maleos returning to the nesting ground to lay has tripled; often during the high season more than 30 birds are present at a time. Another project in the Tangkoko-DuaSaudara Nature Reserve is run by the Tangkoko Ecotourism Guides Club, and involves the clearing of dense secondary growth, replanting of trees, and the re-establishment and monitoring of a viable nesting population (van As 2007). In May 2007, work by the Wildlife Conservation Society and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park on the management of three nesting grounds saw the facilitated hatching and release of their 4,000th chick (Tasirin 2007), while the release of the 5,000th was expected in 2009 (WCS 2009). In 2009, it was reported that a 14-ha stretch of beach had been purchased by Pelestari Alam Liar dan Satwa (PALS: Wildlife and Wildlands Conservation), with the assistance of the Wildlife Conservation Society and external donors, to protect a nesting area for the species (WCS 2009). <br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Strengthen the capacity of conservation agencies and government to prevent illegal activities in formally protected areas and establish new management plans to realistically address conservation issues in national parks and nature reserves. Prioritise the protection of active and threatened nesting grounds over translocation of eggs to recolonise abandoned nesting grounds, which has been successfully implemented at some sites and should remain a tool for the future. Keep nesting grounds free from predators, human disturbance and invasive vegetation, and reforest adjacent areas <strong></strong>(Gorog <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005). Extend protected area status to forest corridors connecting nesting grounds and non-breeding areas. Expand management activities in protected areas, particularly scrub clearance at nesting sites. Initiate Maleo-based conservation activities in Paluki and Saluki, Central Sulawesi. Renew community-based protection initiatives. Monitor the effectiveness of hatcheries and other conservation measures and optimize egg protection strategies. Monitor daily numbers of birds laying at as many colonies as possible. Conduct more intensive research to establish its distribution and the extent of gene flow between nesting grounds.

Global and regional population  trends are difficult to determine, as the species is decreasing in some  range states (sometimes dramatically) whilst increasing in others.  Overall, it is not believed to approach the threshold for the population  decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in  ten years or three generations). For these reasons, it is evaluated as  Least Concern.","In the summer, both maternity colonies and males predominantly occupy  roosts in buildings, such as attics, voids behind sheathing and shutters  etc. It sometimes roosts in ventilation shafts of buildings or joints  in bridges. It prefers summer roosts which offer diverse microclimate,  so that the animals can choose their location according to the outdoor  temperature. Individual, mostly male serotines occasionally use tree  caves or nesting boxes (Baagoe 2001, Simon <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dietz <em>et al.</em>  2009). Nurseries usually consist of 10-60 female, but colonies of up to  300 females have also been reported. Sometimes there are also male  colonies with up to 20 individuals . Serotines hibernate mostly in deep  cavities in buildings at the distance of 40-50 km from a summer roost,  but records from underground sites are also quiet frequent (Dietz <em>et al.</em>  2009). <em>E. serotinus</em> is an edge and open-area specialist. It can glean  insects from vegetation or the ground but the predominant foraging  strategy is aerial hawking (Baagøe 2001). It usually forages around and  in the canopy of trees. In open pastures, it can fly close to the ground  or up to 20 m with sudden steep dives. The species often feeds along  roads and around street lamps. Main prey taxa are associated with  semi-open and open habitats such as meadows and pastures with tree  groups, hedges or woodland edges. The distance to foraging sites can  reach 5–7 km, but usually serotines spend around 90% of their foraging  time at distances smaller than 2 km from the maternity roost. A high  percentage of traditional feeding sites is used by the colonies in  subsequent years Faecal analyses of the serotine bat in different parts  of its European range revealed predominantly Coleoptera (e.g. Aphodius,  Melolonthinae, Necrophorus), Lepidoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera,  Hemiptera and Hymenoptera (see Kyheröinen <em>et al.</em> 2019 for the  review of literature). It is fairly sedentary bat species, with  movements up to 330 km recorded (Havekost 1960). It is known to attain  24 years (Steffens <em>et al.</em> 2007).","In Europe affected by habitat loss and disturbance and destruction of  colonies in houses and in underground hibernation sites. Renovation and  refurbishment of buildings, especially churches, lead to losses of  quarters and roosting possibilities. It also suffers from the  agricultural intensification due to loss of insect-rich meadows and  pastures as hunting grounds through abandonment of free-range farming,  more frequent mowing, increased fertilisation or conversion into arable  land. Loss of hunting grounds due to increased agricultural use (e.g.  through maize cultivation, energy crop cultivation, monocultures and  consequent disappearance of hedges, borders and small-scale structured,  insect-rich cultural and open landscapes is also a significant threat in  developed countries (Simon <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species is at high  risk of collisions with vehicles (Fensome, Mathews 2016). It is  sensitive to light pollution at daytime roosts, commuting routes,  drinking sites and in hibernacula (Voigt <em>et al.</em> 2018).The species  is a host of the rabies-related virus EBLV1. There is increasing  interest in the occurrence, risk to humans and epidemiology of this  virus (e.g. Stantic-Pavlinic 2005), which could have an effect on the  public image of this house-dependent bat.","In the EU, conservational status was favourable only in Pannonian  biogeographical region, whereas it was unfavourable-inadequate in  Alpine, Atlantic, Black Sea, Boreal, Continental, Mediterranean and  Steppic regions  (EEA 2013).

In the Mediterranean area they can use grasslands, but  avoid arable land and maquis. However, in Portugal they use farmland  (olive and cereals), avoiding montado with denser tree cover and  favouring areas close to the roost. In some populations pregnant and  lactating females forage over white street-lamps. In France, feeding  areas are commonly located within 30 km of the main roost, while in  Portugal 82% of females forage within 10 km of the colony. In France,  each female foraged over an area of 18.5 ha in Franche-Comté, 7.5 ha in  the Rhône Valley. Females moved from one good feeding area to another  during the night: from 3 patches within a 500 m radius of a roost to up  to 6 patches 4 km away and demonstrated fidelity to feeding areas over  at least short periods, whereas juveniles changed their feeding areas  every night. Lactating females foraged farther from the roost than  pregnant females. Their home range was 22,318 ± 7,141 ha vs. 10,837 ±  5,399 ha in the Rhône Valley. The foraging area of maternity colonies  was <em>ca</em> 200,000 ha. Lepidoptera dominated in the diet in all seasons and  comprised 76–95 % of the volume. Diptera (mainly Tipulidae in late  summer) was the second main prey in France versus Neuroptera in  Slovenia. Prey also included larvae of Lepidoptera and Aranaeidea, as  well as taxa flying close to vegetation. According to a DNA barcoding  study, Geometridae and Noctuidae were the most represented families of  the lepidopterans. Dipterans were the second most consumed prey. Several  taxa of Coleoptera, Neuroptera, Orthoptera and Trichoptera were also  recorded. Prey also included many pest arthropod species (see Kyheröinen  <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018 for the literature review). Schreiber's bat is  a migrant species which changes its roosts several times during the  year, long-distance movements occur occasionally (the longest recorded  distance is 833 km: Hutterer <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). The maximum known age is 22 years (Gazaryan 2004).","The main threat to this bat is disturbance to colonies, both in winter and summer  roosts. Unsuitable physical protection of cave entrances (e.g. with  improperly designed grilles) may lead to abandonment or decline in  numbers. In 2002, mass mortality events were reported for populations in  France, Spain and Portugal, there are also historical records for such  mortality in Italy. Hundreds of individuals were found dead in spring.  Mortality up to 60% in one year was reported from France (Roué, Némoz  2002), and 40% mortality occurred in Spain during the same period  including 1,000 dead individuals out of 6,000 in one colony. A number of  sites were subsequently deserted. In 2013, a mass-mortality incident  occurred in a <em>Miniopterus schreibersii</em> bat colony, causing the death of ~500  individuals in Northeast Hungary (Bükk mountains).

Nesting usually takes place during the months of September-April (Langrand 1990, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, with the exact timing thought to be dependent upon levels of rainfall (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It has been recorded to breed as early as July (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. During the breeding season it usually occurs in pairs, and is highly territorial and aggressive, particularly towards conspecifics (H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007, 2012, Young 2013)<strong></strong>, with pairs defending territories of up to 2 km in length ( H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007, Young 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Non-breeding birds often congregate in small groups (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, or occasionally in large numbers, with flocks of over 200 birds recorded at Lake Alaotra (Langrand 1990; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong><br/>Habitat</strong> This species occurs in inland freshwater wetland (Young and Rhymer 1998)<strong></strong> habitats from sea-level to 2,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong>.  It is most often found in small streams that run east off the high plateau (H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007, Young 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, but also inhabits lakes, rivers, woodland ponds and marshes, especially in humid forested areas (Langrand 1990, Scott and Rose 1996, Stattersfield <em>et al.</em> 1998, H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. It is sometimes found in rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong>. It favours slow-moving water but will inhabit faster-moving streams and rivers when the preferred habitat is not available (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It rarely inhabits coastal regions, but has been recorded at the Pangalanes Canal (Young 2013)<strong></strong>. <em>Breeding</em> It especially breeds along small streams and backwaters around lakes (Young <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, and also probably along undisturbed rivers (Pidgeon 1996, Young <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong><br/>Diet</strong> This species forages mainly by dabbling ( Kear 2005, H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, but may also forage on land (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. Its diet includes aquatic seeds and plants (Langrand 1990, H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong> as well as invertebrates, particularly molluscs (Kear 2005). In captivity small fish, chironomid flies, filamentous algae and grasses are also eaten (Kear 2005). Its presence in rice-fields suggests that it consumes rice when available (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong><br/>Breeding Site</strong> The nest is constructed from dry grass, leaves and other vegetation, and is built among tufts of herbaceous vegetation on the ground at the water's edge (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992, Young and Rhymer 1998, Young <em>et al.</em> 2000, Young 2013)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","<em>A. melleri</em> is among the largest species of wildfowl found in Madagascar and is widely hunted and trapped for subsistence (and rarely for sport) (Ellis-Joseph <em>et al</em>. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996).<strong></strong> Interviews with hunters at Lake Alaotra suggest c<em>.</em>450 individuals are taken each year, constituting 18% of the global population (Randriamahefasoa 2001)<strong></strong>. Long term deforestation of the central plateau, conversion of marshes to rice-paddies and degradation of water quality in rivers and streams, as a result of deforestation and soil erosion, have probably contributed to its decline (Scott and Rose 1996, H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007, Young <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013)<strong></strong>. Widespread exotic carnivorous fishes, notably <em>Micropterus salmoides </em>(although this may now be extinct) and<em></em> <em>Channa</em> spp<em>.</em>, may threaten young (H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007, 2012)<strong></strong><strong></strong> and cause desertion of otherwise suitable habitat (Kear 2005). Its decline on Mauritius has been attributed to hunting, pollution and introduced rats and mongooses (Ellis-Joseph <em>et al</em>. 1992, H. G. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong> as well as possible displacement by introduced Mallard <em>Anas platyrhynchos </em>(Young and Rhymer 1998), which may also hybridise with this species (Jones 1996, Banks <em>et al. </em>2008).<strong> </strong>Pairs are very territorial and susceptible to human disturbance (H.

198505113,22695683,Accipiter gentilis,Least Concern,,2021,2021-03-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (extent of occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend appears to be stable, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>The species is mainly resident, but its northernmost populations in North America, Scandinavia and Russia migrate south between September and November, returning in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998). Soaring flight is used frequently (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is always seen singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>It inhabits mature woodland, particularly coniferous, but also deciduous or mixed, preferring areas near clearings and the forest edge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Small birds and mammals make up the vast majority of its diet, with grouse, pheasants and partridges being especially important in boreal zones (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built on the forks or branches of large trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994), typically in areas with high (60-90%) canopy closure (Squires <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). <strong>Management information </strong>The species's optimal habitat appears to be areas of farmland interspersed with mature forest; afforestation has improved its status across parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Significant declines in Europe in the 19th-20th centuries are thought to have resulted from persecution and deforestation, with later declines in the 1950s-1960s a result of poisoning from pesticides and heavy metals. Studies on Northern Goshawk nestlings in Norway show that persistent organic pollutants are still present in plasma, preen oil and feathers, suggesting recent and continuous exposure (Briels <em>et al. </em>2019). Persecution continues to be a threat, as is nest robbing for falconry (Orta and Marks 2014). It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind farm developments (Strix 2012). Timber harvest is a primary threat to nesting populations, with nests and nest stands regularly destroyed or by logging operations, but the impact on breeding success is unknown (Squires <em>et al</em>. 2020, Byholm <em>et al. </em>2020). Disturbance caused by logging activity near nests can also cause nest failure (Boal and Mannan 1994). In Alaska, U.S.A, clear-cut, even-aged, short-rotation forest management reduces habitat quality for the species, as does removal of old growth forest patches (Iverson <em>et al</em>. 1996). Increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in western North America are causing a reduction in suitable roosting and foraging sites (Blakey <em>et al. </em>2020). Declines in some European countries are associated with reduced food supply following intensification of farming and forestry and increased competition for nest sites from Eagle Owls <em>Bubo bubo</em>&#160;(Rutz <em>et al. </em>2006).","The European population is estimated at 234,000-380,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International In prep.). Europe forms approximately 26% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of global population size is 900,000-1,460,000, although further validation of this estimate is needed. The population in Canada and the USA is estimated at 210,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2020).&#160;&#160;It is placed in the band 1,000,000-2,499,999 mature individuals.",Unknown,"Widely distributed across Europe and Northern Asia, including the British Isles, Scandinavia, north Russia and Siberia, south to the Mediterranean, the Caucasus, the Himalayas and Japan.

The impact of falconry on wild populations is unknown, but is thought to be minimal. CITES data on reported trade of wild-caught live individuals from 1995-2019 show that Russia is the largest exporter (1257 birds exported), followed by Uzbekistan (504 birds) and Ukraine (82 birds).

The global population is thought to comprise a single, migratory subpopulation. It is therefore listed as Endangered.<br/><p></p>","It is closely associated with wetlands, principally large lakes and rivers, from the lowlands to 5,000 m. It generally nests in trees near water. Breeding takes place from September-February in northern India and Myanmar (BirdLife International 2001), and in Bangladesh it returns to nest sites in late August (Sourav <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Three satellite-tracked birds recently provided evidence that the species undertakes extensive, seasonal migrations of over 4,000 km from India to Mongolia  and Russia. Tracked  individuals also demonstrated a previously unknown capability to fly  directly over the Himalayas at altitudes exceeding 6,000 m  (Steele 2017).<p></p>","Key threats are habitat loss, degradation and disturbance. Across the Indian subcontinent, and probably most of its range, wetlands have been drained or converted for agriculture and human settlements. The felling of large trees near wetlands has reduced the availability of nest and roost sites. The spread of water hyacinth <em>Eichhornia crassipes </em>is a problem in India, as is the siltation of lakes due to catchment deforestation. Pollution of wetlands with pesticides and industrial effluents reduces breeding success. Habitat loss and degradation are compounded by disturbance of wetlands. Reductions in the prey base, primarily through hunting and over-fishing, are further consequences of increasing human pressure. In Myanmar, the development of oil and gas fields is a threat and, in China, hunting is a localised problem (Orta<em> et al. </em>2020). In Mongolia, during surveys in summer 2009, it was noted that two recently completed hydroelectric dams were severely disrupting water levels in the affected drainage basins and could potentially affect all sites where the species occurs in the Great Lake Basin (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009). Over-fishing was also noted at several sites and low rainfall was leading to falling water levels in some areas (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009). Loss of mature trees following two major cyclones may have affected breeding sites in Odisha, India (M. Bhujabal <em>in litt.</em> 2017).<br/><p></p>","Based on surveys and available data from across the species's extant distribution, the population is estimated to fall well below 2,500 mature individuals (M. Steele and M. Gilbert <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). It is therefore placed here in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals. The global population is considered to comprise a single migratory population, rather than multiple isolated subpopulations (Steele 2017).",Decreasing,"This species was previously thought to be a migratory breeder north of the Himalayas, with a stronghold in <strong>Mongolia</strong>, and a resident population in the Indian subcontinent, recent evidence and re-evaluation of historical data has since suggested that this is not, and may never have been, the case. Surveys in Mongolia between 2005-2009 found the species to be absent from 13 of 21  historically known sites (Gilbert <em>et al. </em>2014), and found very little evidence for the species breeding anywhere north of  the Himalayas. Further surveys in Mongolia between June-August in 2012-2015 similarly found no evidence of breeding (M. Steele <em>in litt.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The species may instead breed only in northern <strong>India</strong> (apparent strongholds in Assam and Uttarakhand), <strong>Bangladesh </strong>and <strong>Myanmar</strong>, with very small numbers in <strong>Bhutan</strong>, dispersing north of the Himalayas to <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, <strong>Russia </strong>and Mongolia in its non-breeding season (May to September). There is no recent record of breeding in <strong>Afghanistan </strong>(S. Ostrowski <em>in litt.</em> 2017), the current status in <strong>Pakistan </strong>appears to be uncertain, and there is uncertainty around the extent of any historical breeding in central <strong>China</strong>,  though virtually all Chinese records also fall outside of the time of  year the species has been confirmed breeding, and while there are many  records of adults and juveniles together, there is a notable lack of  records of nests or collected eggs from north of the Himalayas. Further evidence for this hypothesis comes from recent telemetry studies which confirmed connectivity between India and Mongolia (Steele 2017; M. Steele <em>in litt.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Formerly considered one of the most numerous Asian raptors, declines were first noticed as early as the 1960s. Long term declines are well known from the west of the range,  and the species is now virtually extirpated from former sites in west Asia.  Analysis of recent records from India and Bangladesh are also  indicative of a substantial decline throughout the historic range (Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2014; S. U.

Some authors have indicated its occurrence in secondary forest (Moynihan 1976, Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976). In the 1980s, Soini (1982, 1988) recorded it as particularly abundant in areas moderately affected by agricultural activities and hunting. Although the species is capable of existing in isolated forest patches near human settlements (Hernández-Camacho and Defler 1985). In Ecuador, it is known to occur between altitudes 200 and 940 m, but usually below 400 m asl (Tirira 2007). As in Peru, it shows a marked preference for inundated forests, liana forest, and the edges of rivers and lakes, and can also be found in secondary forest (Tirira 2007). In a long term study (longer than 10 years) de la Torre <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported the disappearance of groups in areas with high rates of fragmentation.&#160; Pygmy marmosets generally travel in the lower layers of the forest, keeping to dense vegetation in the understorey.<br/><br/><em>Cebuella </em>is a gum-feeding specialist, with behavioural and dental adaptations to gnaw holes in the bark of certain species of trees and vines to stimulate gum production (Soini 1988, Yepez <em>et al</em>. 2005). Tamarins, <em>Leontocebus </em>(<em>Saguinus</em>) <em>lagonotus</em>, <em>L. fuscicollis</em>, <em>L. nigricollis</em> and <em>L. tripartitus</em> groups tend to pirate these gum feeding holes wherever the two species are sympatric (Soini 1988, 1993; de la Torre pers. obs.).&#160;<br/><br/>Group sizes range from 2-9, with 1-2 adult males and 1-2 adult females. As in other callitrichids, the single breeding female in the group produces twins twice a year, and the adult males and other group members help her to carry them (Soini 1988). Successful reproduction in couples with no helpers may take several years (six in a couple that was studied at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Ecuador (de la Torre <em>et al</em>. 2009). Home ranges are typically small from 0.1 to 1.5 ha, centred on one or two trees which supply the gum they need. The entire group will move to a new home range when the gum sources become inadequate (de la Torre 2009, Soini 1988).","There is hunting in some parts of the range (e.g., in Ecuador), as well as use as pets (in Ecuador and Peru). The principal reason for its inclusion in CITES Appendix I in 1977-1979 (now relegated to Appendix II; see Mack and Mittermeier 1984) was the international trade, particularly from the area of Iquitos, Colombia. Habitat loss is taking place in several areas of its range and local extinctions have been reported in areas in northeastern Ecuador (de la Torre <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Gallery forests along rivers, that are the habitat of&#160;<em>Cebuella pygmaea</em>, are preferred for human settlements and are severely affected by deforestation. Large areas of the distribution range of this subspecies are affected by mining, oil extraction and palm and coca plantations. Although the species could use secondary forest if there are exudate sources, the disappearance of groups in this type of forests have been documented in the long term in several populations in Ecuador (de la Torre&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Considering the specialization of&#160;<em>Cebuella</em><em>&#160;</em>on gallery forests, the real extension of the habitat suitable for the species is significantly smaller that the area of distribution that is presented in the assessment map. In the 14 populations of&#160;<em>C. pygmaea</em>&#160;that have been studied in Ecuador, group territories are widely separated. Thus, even in well preserved forests like the Tiputini Biological Station, in seven years of intense surveys, the number of pygmy marmosets that have been recorded does not exceed 40, including individuals of groups that have disappeared.<br/><br/>Observations of the subspecies in Colombia and Peru by S. Shanee evidenced very disjointed populations and much higher levels of deforestation in gallery forests.<br/><br/>In Colombia, the subspecies is very rare species in the lower Caquetá River, as well as in Puré River. However, east of the Putumayo River, the area of distribution corresponds to very well preserved forests (large indigenous reserves and national Parks).","<p>In Ecuador, densities range from 1-6 individuals/km² of river (de la Torre <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).<br/><br/>This species is suspected to have undergone a population size reduction greater than 30% over a three generation period due to a continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat from deforestation, mining, oil palm cultivation, settlements and other anthropogenic threats, and from hunting.</p>",Decreasing,"Following Van Roosmalen and Van Roosmalen (1997), the Western Pygmy Marmoset (<em>Cebuella pygmaea</em>) occurs in the upper Amazon basin, north of the Rio Solimões in Brazil west from the Rio Japurá, and south of the Río Caquetá in Colombia, Amazonian Ecuador and Peru, north of the Solimões-Amazonas-Marañon, and east (left bank) of the Rio Pastaza in Peru. The easternmost localities in Brazil include the Paraná do Aranapu and Paraná do Jarauá on the lower Rio Japurá. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) and Defler (2003, 2004) recorded that it is well known south of the Río Caquetá in Colombia, but that reports of its occurrence further north in the upper Río Guaviare region, remain to be confirmed. The only evidence to date is a captive specimen believed to have been obtained from Cano Morrocoy on the south bank of the Río Guaviare. Izawa (1975) reported that it is absent from the Río Peneya, north of the Río Caquetá, and during further surveys was unable to confirm its presence anywhere else north of the Río Caquetá, although in a later publication (Izawa 1979) he indicated that it may occur on the Río Orteguaza, a northern tributary of the uppermost reaches. It evidently occurs throughout the Ecuadorian Amazon (de la Torre 2000). In Peru, Aquino and Encarnación (1994a) extend the range to the west of the Río Pastaza, to the region of the Cerro Campanquiz and basin of the Río Santiago, south to the Río Mayo in the Department of San Martín, a left bank tributary of the Río Huallaga, and to both sides of Río Marañon. The range south of the Río Marañon west of the Rio Huallaga could belong to either <em>Cebuella pygmaea </em>or <em>C. niveiventris </em>according to the distribution proposed by Van Roosmalen and Van Roosmalen (1997). A small isolated subpopulation has also been reported west of the Rio Huallaga in northern Peru (Shanee <em>et al.</em> 2013). The area is next to a Conservation Concession called Gran Simacache. The survey site was at 07°2'39""S 77°11'59""W, at around 200 m asl, the area is about 100 km west of the known distribution. The true extent of this subpopulation is unknown but surveys to the east of the Rio Huallaga have failed to find this species. Because of the high rates of deforestation in the area it is likely that without protection this subpopulation could disappear in the near future.","The species is affected by illegal trade. There is hunting in some parts of the range (e.g., in Ecuador), as well as use as pets (in Ecuador and Peru).

The population trend is stable overall with localised decreases in population size, usually driven by human disturbance and climatic variability. Increasing ocean temperature and strong winds are linked to negative effects on adult foraging and chick survival. The stable trend should be taken cautiously as 60% of the sites have an “unknown” population trends due to data deficiency. In Australia, there is a decrease in the population size in New South Wales and South Australia while Tasmania is data deficient. Populations are stable in WA and increasing in Victoria. In New Zealand, the situation of the species remains unclear due to inconsistent monitoring efforts over large parts of the country. Little penguins along the South Island’s West Coast, Banks Peninsula seem to be decreasing over the past decades while penguin numbers around Oamaru are stable if not increasing. Although the species has a large estimated extent of occurrence, about 69% of sites have fewer than 100 breeding individuals. For the remaining sites, 28% have between 100 and 5000 individuals and only 3% of sites have a population size above 5,000 individuals. Sites with small populations are more vulnerable with reported local extinctions. Several sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease in population size, while many former breeding colonies no longer exist. The population range and size do not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable criteria (extent of occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and &lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p>","<p>The little penguin (<em>Eudyptula minor</em>), the smallest of all penguins (~30-40 cm), is endemic to southern Australia and New Zealand, breeding during the austral autumn to summer months. These dark indigo-blue coloured penguins are the only genuinely nocturnal penguin species on land; adults always arrive after dusk and leave before dawn (Klomp &amp; Wooller 1991, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2007, Rodríguez <em>et al. </em>2016). The global population is estimated as 469,760 individuals. The little penguin population trend is stable overall with localised decrease in some sites. This species is a generalist feeder with significant variability in diet between colonies and even between years at the same colony (Klomp and Wooller 1988, Gales &amp; Pemberton 1990, Cullen <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fraser and Lalas 2004, Chiaradia<em> et al.</em> 2010, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2016). They feed mainly on clupeids such as anchovy <em>Engraulis</em> sp and sardines <em>Sardinops sagax </em>when feeding chicks but they may also feed on krill <em>Nyctiphanes australis </em>and several species of cephalopods at all stages of breeding (Gales &amp; Pemberton 1990, Cullen <em>et al.</em> 1992, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2016) and jellyfish (Cavallo <em>et al.</em> 2018). This variability in the diet is also found in their trophic interactions where penguins can reduce the prey trophic range in response to years of low breeding success (Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2010) and segregate foraging areas within the same colony (Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2018). The species dives to a maximum 72 metres, with a preferred depth zone between 20 to 30 metres (Chiaradia <em>et al. </em>2007, Ropert-Coudert <em>et al. </em>2009)</p><p>Penguins typically lay two eggs per clutch (Stahel <em>et al. </em>1987), and up to three clutches over a breeding season (Johannesen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The penguins exhibit six main breeding stages: courtship, pre-laying exodus, pre-laying, incubation, guard and post-guard (Chiaradia &amp; Kerry 1999); followed by moulting and inter-breeding stages (Salton <em>et al.</em> 2015). When feeding chicks, some parents make more foraging trips than their mates. This situation represents the norm (72% of cases), rather than the previously expected equal parenting (Saraux<em> et al.</em> 2011). Individuals can also alternate between two consecutive long foraging trips and several shorter ones throughout the chick-rearing period (Saraux<em> et al. </em>2011). Short trips allow for regular food provisioning of chicks (high feeding frequency and larger meals), whereas longer trips are triggered by a parent’s low body mass and therefore the need to replenish its energy reserves. Little penguins form groups when crossing the beach to nesting sites and individuals seem to choose their travelling partners (Daniel<em> et al. </em>2007). When foraging,&#160; some individuals can take advantage of human-made features, like ship channels to aid in their foraging (Preston <em>et al.</em> 2008). Breeding age, ranging from 2 to 18+ years, seems to play a crucial role as well, as middle-aged (8-12 years) penguins are better breeders (Nisbet &amp; Dann 2009), employ more effective foraging strategies (Zimmer <em>et al. </em>2011) and feed in different locations (Pelletier<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p><p></p>","<p>Many populations of little penguins are severely threatened by human disturbance such as introduced predators, domestic dogs, roadkill, coastal development, watercraft injuries, oil spills and gillnet fishing in both Australia and New Zealand (Cannel <em>et al.</em> 2016; Chiaradia 2013, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017, Dann 2013). Reduction in prey abundance is another major vulnerability to little penguin populations (Cannel <em>et al. </em>2016; Chiaradia 2013) as well as natural predators such as fur seals and corvids (Ekanayake at al. 2015a,b). Changes in the abundance of major prey can result in a dramatic change in their diet composition and trophic interactions, resulting in increased mortality and decreased breeding success (Dann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>A newer and additional challenge for this species is in the fast-changing marine and terrestrial environment, particularly in the rapidly warming sea of south-eastern Australia (Ramirez <em>et al.</em> 2017, Voice <em>et al.</em> 2006; Wu<em> et al. </em>2012), wherein southwestern Australia the warming sea has been associated with poorer breeding (Cannell <em>et al. </em>2012). Penguins have also been shown to catch less prey under warmer conditions (Carroll <em>et al. </em>2016). Oceanographic change may lead to a mismatch between plankton and the small pelagic fish that are also penguin prey (Hinder<em> et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Increasing terrestrial temperatures in the spring and summer months can cause fatal hyperthermia in both chicks and adults (Cannell <em>et al.</em> 2011, Cannell <em>et al. </em>2012, Cannell <em>et al.</em> 2016). This issue is particularly relevant in those colonies where nesting occurs within the vegetation rather than in burrows as a result of a soft, sandy substrate. <br/><br/>Remarkably, some of these pressures can be locally offset by a wide range of conservation efforts, such as the case of increasing population size at Phillip Island (Sutherland &amp; Dann 2012, 2014), St Kilda (Preston <em>et al.</em> 2010; Preston 2011), Manly (Carlile<em> et al. </em>2015), Oamaru (Agnew <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160; Sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease, where many known breeding colonies no longer exist (Dann 1994; Stevenson &amp; Woehler 2007, Wilson &amp; Mattern 2019). Local extinction of many small colonies continues in Australia and New Zealand.</p>","<p>The global population size has been quantified for most sites, with the current population estimate of 469,760 breeding adults. This population size is smaller than the previously estimate, where the total population was only considered as under 1,000,000 individuals, but was based on non-quantified data. With quantified data, there is an increase of 18% in population size when historic and recent data are compared. However, this increase should be interpreted with caution as it is very likely to be related to improved population survey effort rather than an actual increase in population. For sites with current population estimates, 60% of the sites have an “unknown” trend due to data deficiency. Nevertheless, for the sites where data were available, 51% of sites were stable, 29% deteriorating and 20% improving. Fifteen sites are suspected extinct.</p>",Stable,"<p>Endemic to Australia and New Zealand.

It is likely to have declined as a result of habitat degradation and destruction at the (unknown) breeding areas and on wintering grounds, exacerbated by hunting and trapping at roost-sites. However, it might remain extant, and surveys are required in putative breeding areas, particularly in Myanmar. Any remaining population is probably tiny, and for these reasons it is treated as Critically Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","Its ecology is almost totally unknown. It has been recorded only between December and February roosting in reedbeds. By inference from behaviour of the related African River-martin <em>Pseudochelidon eurystomina</em>, it may breed on sand-bars of large rivers and feed over forested country. It has been speculated that, if it nests in Thailand, it would do so from February-April, after which monsoon rains raise water-levels above its postulated nesting habitat. However, there is some evidence that it might breed earlier than this, be partially nocturnal and perhaps not be associated with rivers at all but perhaps caves (Tobias 2000).<p></p>","There has been a massive decline in the number of swallows roosting at Beung Boraphet as a result of intensive trapping for food and roost habitat destruction, primarily through burning of reeds for conversion to lotus cultivation. A number of threats could have contributed to its overall decline, including disturbance of riverine sand-bars, flooding upstream and the alteration of downstream hydrology caused by dams, extensive deforestation, and agricultural intensification. These threats are widespread across South-East Asia. Following its discovery, its decline may have been exacerbated by demand for birds as zoo exhibits or for private collections. <p></p>","Any remaining population is assumed to be tiny (numbering fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals), based on the lack of confirmed records at the only known site since 1978.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This is a migratory species, migrants leaving their breeding grounds between August and November, and returning in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It relies heavily on soaring flight using thermals, and thus avoids large bodies of water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Birds are generally observed singly or in pairs, but will congregate at plentiful food sources, and migrate in flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Porter and Aspinall 2010). <strong>Habitat </strong>It breeds near forest edges, preferring moist woodland; most nest in lowlands but it is recorded breeding up to 2,200 m in montane areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians are all taken as prey, with different prey types predominating in different parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built in trees, usually close to the forest edge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>Where populations are struggling, productivity can be increased artificially by ensuring both chicks survive to fledging: in natural conditions one is almost always lost by siblicide, known as ""cainism"" (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","The main threats posed to this species are through habitat loss (notably abandonment or conversion of grasslands into arable land and deforestation) and hunting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Meyburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). The latter is especially prevalent on migration, with possibly thousands of birds shot annually in Syria and Lebanon (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Deforestation is degrading breeding habitats (Dravecký <em>et al</em>. 2015), and disturbance caused by forestry workers reduces breeding success (Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al.</em>. 2019). Studies on habitat use in Estonia suggest that changes in agricultural practices, particularly a reduction in grassland, and an increasing sown area of oilseed rape and maize may degrade foraging habitat around breeding areas (Vali <em>et al. </em>2017). Abandonment of breeding territories has been linked to depopulation of rural areas leading to a decline in stock grazing, resulting in afforestation of grassland and a decline in rodent prey (Demerdzhiev <em>et al. </em>2019)<em>.</em>&#160;It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012). Electrocution may pose an additional threat on migration and at wintering grounds, but this has not been well studied (Demerdzhiev &amp; Ratarova-Georgieva 2017).&#160;The Chernobyl nuclear accident may have affected the species (Alon 2000 in Global Raptor Information Network 2015). Construction of the new Istanbul airport could have an impact on the species (S. Oppel <em>in litt</em>. 2014).

In eastern Europe, agricultural intensification and the abandonment of traditional floodplain management have reduced foraging habitat quality (A. Lõhmus in litt. 1999).<em>&#160;</em>Deforestation in breeding areas poses a threat through loss of nesting sites - in an area in Russia where 40 pairs of Greater Spotted Eagles nested in 2012, half was cut down (I. Karyakin pers. comm. in Maciorowski <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Forestry operations are also a major cause of disturbance, as birds are intolerant of human presence in their territories (Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Drainage of wet woodland makes them more accessible to predators such as&#160;<em>Martes martes&#160;</em>(Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014)<em>.</em>Wintering habitats are also being lost - in Thailand, low intensity, rain-fed single crop rice are being replaced by multi-cropped intensive rice farms which are less suitable for foraging (P. D. Round <em>in litt.</em> 2016). <br/><br/>Shooting is a threat in Russia, the Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Africa (Brochet <em>et al. </em>2019; P. D. Round <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>1998, P. Mirski <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), together with deliberate and accidental poisoning across much of its range (Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;The poaching of eggs and hatchlings for collectors is also a serious threat&#160;(Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). On migration and at wintering grounds, electrocution, collision with wind turbines, shooting and poisoning&#160;are major causes of mortality (Perlman and Granit 2012;&#160;Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Lead poisoning from consuming waterbirds is a threat in some areas, for example at wintering grounds in Spain (Perez-Garcia&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).<p></p>","In Europe, the   breeding population is estimated to number 960-1,300 breeding pairs, equating   to 1,900-2,500 individuals (BirdLife International In prep.). Europe forms 25-49%   of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population   size is 3,900-10,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. There is very little data available on population sizes further east in the species's range. National population estimates include: c.100-10,000 breeding pairs,   c.50-1,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in   China; &lt; c.50 individuals on migration and &lt; c.50 wintering individuals   in Taiwan and c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on   migration in Russia (Brazil 2009). Estimates based on known breeding areas in the Volga-Ural region and southwest Siberia and the amount of suitable habitat suggest that the Russian population may be as large as 4,000-4,500 breeding pairs (Karyakin 2008, Karyakin <em>et al. </em>2012), however, given the vast size of the species's Russian range, further research is necessary to validate this.

Wintering birds have also been reported in <strong>Hong Kong (China)</strong>. The population probably numbers fewer than 10,000 mature individuals with Russia holding 2,800-3,000 pairs. The European population is estimated to be 960-1,300&#160;pairs (BirdLife International In prep.).

The abundance and distribution of rabbits, its favoured prey, influence population density, range and reproductive performance (Fernández<span style=""font-style: italic; ""> et al. </span>2009). Indeed, its evolutionary dependence on rabbits has been suggested as permanently limiting its abundance and distribution (Ferrer and Negro 2004), although it may take alternative prey where rabbits are scarce in the non-breeding season (Sánchez <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2010). Breeding birds are sedentary, with median home range sizes of 28,000 ha during the breeding period and 10,500 ha in the non-breeding season&#160;<span class=""datalabel1""><span lang=""EN-US"">(González and Margalida 2008).<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;Within&#160;Doñana National Park, Spain, tree height and distance from human activity are the most important variables&#160;explaining nest site selection (Bisson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2002), but many recently-colonised territories are located in human-modified habitat, especially farmland with high rabbit abundance (González and Oria 2004,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Castaño 2005, J.

Mortality from intentional poisoning, which appears to be a particular problem in hunting reserves where game is commercially exploited, may once again be on the increase (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2016). 15 cases of death have been reported from poisoning events in 2015 - 2016 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2016). This is of particular concern, as the dip in the population in the late 1990s was caused by additional mortality due to poisoning events, with the Doñana National Park population seriously affected by the illegal use of poisoned bait&#160;during this period (Ortega&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009, Ferrer <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Electrocution remains a significant source of mortality, despite mitigation measures leading to a highly significant reduction in the numbers of birds killed (<span class=""msoIns"">Lopez-Lopez <em>et al. </em><span class=""msoIns"">2011). This is a particular problem for immature eagles, and of six satellite-tagged individuals that visited Morocco in 2015 one was electrocuted, prompting the discovery of four further carcasses of immature birds near two recently installed high-voltage powerlines (Godino<em> et al.</em> 2016). Relatively few individuals are believed to have entered Morocco, indicating that powerlines may represent a serious threat to the potential re-establishment of a breeding population in the country. Despite the general success of mitigation measures applied in&#160;Andalucía (<span class=""msoIns"">Lopez-Lopez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em><span class=""msoIns"">2011), eleven individuals have been found electrocuted since 2010 (J.

Garrido <em>in litt.</em> 2016), suggesting that hunting remains a threat to the species. Additionally, the ingestion of lead shot embedded in the flesh of prey items may be a problem in certain areas&#160;(González and Oria 2004, <span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns"">Pain&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). The threats from poisoning and shooting highlight the importance of maintaining co-operation with landowners throughout the breeding range. In Spain, rab<span lang=""EN-US"">bit populations declined by 55% between 1973 and 2002 (Virgós <em>et al.</em> 2007). The incidence of viral haemorrhagic diseases and changes in the management of hunting estates has reduced prey availability.

R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016). The development of large areas of land for the production of renewable energy so far does not appear to have had negative impacts, however one individual was found dead in Andalucía in 2012 (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt.</em> 2016), and this threat may be increasing as more wind farms are being installed in many parts of the species's range (S Cabezas-Díaz <em>in litt. </em>2020). Human activities in the vicinity of active nests can disturb incubating adults and reduce hatching success (González&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006,&#160;<strong></strong>Margalida&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). The limitation of funds for adequate monitoring and implementation of mitigation actions (particularly around the safety of powerlines for birds) may be a significant constraint in the future (S.

Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2013; S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Interchange of individuals has been noted between the populations in Portugal and in&#160;Andalucía. There is considerable variation in the rate of population increase throughout the range: In Extremadura, the increase was only c. 2% between 1990 and 2015 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C.

Improved adult survival appears to have driven the population increase and the observed temporal and spatial variation in population growth rates (Ferrer &amp; Calderon 1990; Ortega <em>et al. </em>2009). More recently, reduced adult survival appears to have caused a plateau in population size (<span lang=""EN-US"">S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Initial positive trends were associated with conservation measures, which reduced the mortality associated with powerlines and poisoning events, but also benefited the population through supplementary feeding, reparation of nests, reintroductions and reduction of disturbance during the breeding period (González&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2007,&#160;<span lang=""ES"">López-López <em>et al. </em>2011,&#160;J.

However, recently mortality caused by powerlines, shooting and collision with wind turbines has increased, and poisoning remains a threat (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In Andalucía, a reintroduced population has been established in Cádiz, with four to five breeding pairs producing offspring, which have subsquently bred at several sites in southern Spain and in Portugal (Muriel <em>et al. </em>2011, J.

Around 60% of the total breeding population is now located in protected areas (national and EU Special Protected Areas), down from c. 70% in 2011 (Barov and Derhé 2011), which may reflect the growth of the population into new areas. Dispersal and critical areas for the species have not been updated for several years, therefore many are not legally delimited or protected against damaging activities (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Since 1987, national and regional governments have been implementing a coordinated conservation plan for the species. A European action plan was published in 1996 and updated in 2008 (Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2008). The national plan for Spain was implemented in 2018, while in <span lang=""EN-US"">Portugal a plan is being prepared&#160;(S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C.

As a result, a national law was approved in Spain in 2008, establishing tools for the protection of birds against collision and electrocution in power lines and best practice for new power line construction or modification (Guil <em>et al. </em>2011). &#160;Work has also been carried out to isolate dangerous power lines on private farms (Cabezas-Díaz 2011). In Portugal, the main potentially dangerous electric pylons have been identified in the core areas of the species and a modification plan has been established. Around 40 km of powerlines were modified between 2009 and 2011; however, around 80 km still require funding (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Isolation of power lines has been demonstrated to be obsolete in many cases (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160; <em>in lill. </em>2020). A supplementary feeding programme has been established to mitigate the effects of rabbit decreases, and has significantly increased breeding success (González and Margalida 2008).

This network involved 112 municipalities, 22,000 ha of private land and 96 schools, and focused on habitat management, species conservation, awareness raising and information activities across the whole distribution range in Spain (Cabezas-Díaz and Hernáez 2012). In Castilla-La Mancha, an EU LIFE-funded projected, ""Conservación de especies prioritarias en el monte mediterráneo en Castilla-La Mancha""&#160;is working for the conservation of this and&#160;other species related to Mediterranean forests, while a counterpart project, LIFE Imperial, is focused on the conservation of the species in Portugal (R.

Work is ongoing to raise awareness and support on private land where the species breeds, including improving habitat management (García 2007), and nearly 50% of breeding pairs are covered by such projects (González and Margalida 2008). In Cádiz, 73 young birds have been released as part of a reintroduction project (Ferrer 2011 <em>unpubl</em>.), and currently five breeding pairs have become established in the province providing a new population nucleus (Muriel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).

Only a small, very rapidly declining population remains, owing primarily to poisoning and persecution, as well as ecosystem alterations. Data published in 2016 suggests that the population in Africa is declining extremely rapidly, and future population assessments may lead to further uplisting.<br/><p></p>","The species inhabits dry savanna, arid plains, deserts and open mountain slopes (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, up to 3,500 m (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In Ethiopia, it is also found at the edge of forests, having been recorded at Bonga Forest and forest in Bale Mountains National Park in 2007, as well as the Afro-alpine habitats of the national park in 2005 (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. It ranges widely when foraging (P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong> and is mainly a scavenger, feeding predominantly on any large carcasses or their remains (Mundy 1982, Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). It is also known to hunt, probably taking a variety of small reptiles, fish, birds and mammals, and has been observed apparently group-hunting flamingo <em>Phoenicopterus</em> chicks (McCulloch 2006a, 2006b). It builds solitary nests (containing just one egg), often in <em>Acacia</em> (its distribution sometimes being limited by these trees' distribution [Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997]<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>), but also in <em>Balanites</em> and <em>Terminalia</em> (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It does not breed until at least six years old, then fledging c.0.4 young/pair/year (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). Ringing studies in Namibia have revealed a very low return rate (Simmons and Bridgeford 1997). The species's minimum home range has been suggested to be 8 km<sup>2</sup>, and this can expand to 15 km<sup>2</sup> in some habitats (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005), but it may now be that 80-150km<sup>2 </sup>may be more appropriate (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). In Mozambique, egg-laying occurs from late April until mid-August, with a peak in May and June (Parker 2005). A nest found in Oman contained a small chick in early March, and thought to have fledged in mid-June (Wernery 2009).<br/><p></p>","Widespread accidental poisoning, largely due to strychnine, used by many farmers for predator control,  and more recently carbofuran, has contributed significantly to declines (Brown 1986, P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 2000, Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010, C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Several Lappet-faced Vultures&#160;were found to have died after feeding on the carcass of a poisoned jackal in Namibia (Komen 2009) and two birds were killed as a result of feeding on a poisoned carcass in Kenya (Kendall and Virani 2012). A mass poisoning event involving at least 15 Lappet-faced Vultures occurred in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012&#160;(Groom <em>et al</em>. 2012), while another in Botswana in 2019 resulted in the death of 14 Lappet-faced Vultures (BirdGuides 2019). The upper beaks of eight of these birds were removed suggesting that they may be traded for traditional medicine.&#160;It is also often mistakenly persecuted as a livestock predator (Brown 1986): one major deliberate poisoning incident killed 86 individuals in Namibia (Simmons 1995)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>Other major threats to the species include nest predation by humans, reduced food availability (including the replacement of the traditional ""Dabokka"" movement of camels with cargo tracks [H. Ibrahim <em>in litt. </em>2016])&#160;and electrocution (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Increasing use of agricultural pesticides may also be a problem for the species (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992), including those breeding at Tayma, Saudi Arabia (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nest disturbance, to which it is extremely sensitive (Steyn 1982)<strong></strong>, may be growing with an increase in forest settlements in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong> and the increasing recreational use of off-road vehicles (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992).&#160;In Saudi Arabia, suitable nesting trees may be subject to the most intense human disturbance as shepherds also use the same large trees for shelter for themselves and their livestock (Shobrak 2011).&#160;Breeding birds at Tayma could face disturbance from motorised vehicles in the desert (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nest trees are also susceptible to fire and are often pushed over by elephants (Murn and Botha <em>in prep.</em>), although tree availability is not thought to be a limiting factor for the species (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>The population collapse in West Africa may be a result of higher nest disturbance, local extinctions of wild ungulates through habitat modification and over-hunting, intensified cattle farming in which sick or dying animals are rarely abandoned, and an increase in accidental poisoning<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Thiollay 2006<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>, although the latter threat, in particular, requires further study (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). National vaccination campaigns in West Africa have reduced illness in domestic livestock, and sick animals can now be sold off, rather than abandoned, due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). The species may be hunted for medicine and cultural reasons in West Africa, and some ethnic groups in the sub-region hunt vultures for food, though the impact on this species is unknown (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). It is also thought to be used for traditional medicine in South Africa, with all vultures having the potential for traditional medicine use in southern Africa (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2013, W. Goodwin <em>in litt.</em> 2016) and has been recorded in trade in West and Central African markets (Buij <em>et al</em>. 2016). With 858-1,284 individuals reported to have been traded over a six year period in West Africa, numbers traded represent a potentially significant proportion of the regional population.<br/><br/>In central Mozambique, the population has declined due to a scarcity of game and livestock following the armed conflict of the 1970s and 1980s, and the surviving population continues to be threatened by the over-exploitation of game by poachers (Parker 2005). There are incidences of deliberate poisoning by poachers, due to the belief that the arriving vultures will give away the locations of poached animals (Hancock 2009, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2015). In Ethiopia, the principal threat to the species is habitat loss on the lowland plains (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007, 2012)<strong></strong>. Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species.<p></p>","Data from Mundy <em>et al. </em>(1992) suggest the African population is at least 8,000 individuals, equating to c.5,330 mature individuals. National estimates for Africa include 160-500 individuals in Uganda (Pomeroy <em>et al. </em>2015), 150-200 pairs in South Africa (Barnes 2000), c.2,000 individuals in Tanzania (Shimelis <em>et al. </em>2005), 300 pairs in Zimbabwe (Boshoff <em>et al. </em>1997), 400-500 pairs in Ethiopia (Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005), 10-20 pairs in Egypt (Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005) and 500 pairs in Namibia (Simmons and Brown, cited in Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). There are an estimated 600 pairs in the Arabian Peninsula (Jennings 2010, cited in Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The total population is therefore estimated to be least 9,200 individuals, of which c.6530 are mature individuals, although this may prove to be an overestimate given current trends for this species.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;breeds in <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Senegal</strong>, <strong>Niger</strong>, <strong>Mauritania</strong>, <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Burkina Faso</strong>, <strong>Chad</strong>, <strong>Sudan</strong>, <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, <strong>Somalia</strong>, <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, <strong>Rwanda</strong>, <strong>Uganda</strong>, <strong>Kenya</strong>, <strong>Tanzania</strong>, <strong>Zambia</strong>, <strong>Malawi</strong>, <strong>Mozambique</strong>, <strong>Namibia</strong>, <strong>Botswana</strong>, <strong>Zimbabwe</strong>, <strong>South Africa</strong>, <strong>Eswatini</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> (an increasing population, in excess of 500 individuals [Newton and Shobrak 1993, M.

The species also occurs in <strong>The Gambia</strong>, northern <strong>Guinea</strong>, <strong>Côte d'Ivoire</strong>, <strong>Benin</strong>, <strong>Central African Republic</strong> and southern <strong>Angola</strong> (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is no longer thought to breed in Côte d'Ivoire (G. Rondeau <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>It has been extinct in Algeria and Tunisia since the 1930s, and now only small populations remain in southern Egypt, and Mauritania (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. The last records from Morocco concerned two birds in 1972 (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is considered likely to be extinct in Western Sahara, as it has not been recorded there since 1955 (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Nigeria, there has been a major decline since the late 1970s and it may now have been extirpated (Brown 1986, Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It probably previously bred in Jordan<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Evans and Al-Mashaqbah 1996)<strong></strong>, has largely disappeared where formerly common in Somaliland (Somalia) (A. Jama <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2009), and is considered extinct in Israel, where three birds remained until 1994 (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>The species was not recorded during surveys in 2004 in northern Mali and Niger along the same transects that yielded 96 birds in 1971-1973<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Thiollay 2006)<strong></strong>. The combination of these results with comparable transect surveys from Burkina Faso indicate a decline in abundance of c.97% in rural areas and c.39% in national parks between 1969-1973 and 2003-2004 (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>, and declines of 50% were also recorded between 1978-1986 and 2003-2005 on transects in the Masai Mara, Kenya (Virani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011). It is suffering a slow decline in southern Africa (Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997); the largest conservation area in South Africa (Kruger National Park) contains only approximately 50 nests (Murn and Botha <em>in press</em>) and populations are likely to disappear in South Africa should current levels of exploitation and other pressures continue (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;However the population in central Mozambique is probably stable (Parker 2005)<strong></strong>. There are possibly 1,000 pairs (almost 3,000 individuals) in southern Africa, at least the same in eastern and northeastern Africa, and possibly only c.500 pairs in West Africa and the Sahara, giving a total rough estimate of the African population of at least 8,000 individuals (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). However, given the age of this estimate this may prove to be an overestimate (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016)<em> </em>as<em> </em>Ogada <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimate a median population decline in Africa of 80% (range: 65-87%) over three generations (45 years).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation&#160;</strong><strong>and Research&#160;</strong><strong>Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix I &amp; II. Raptors MOU Category 1. The species was put forward as a candidate for the CITES Review of Significant Trade in 2004 (CITES<em> in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. It breeds in a number of protected areas within its extensive range. Road surveys in Uganda only recorded the species within protected areas (Pomeroy <em>et al. </em>2015). Ecological research is ongoing, notably in Saudi Arabia (Newton and Shobrak 1993)<strong></strong> and southern Africa (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016). Following a workshop, a five-year international action plan for the species was published in 2005, with the aims of stabilising or increasing its populations, improving knowledge of its distribution, population size and trends and minimising the impact of human activities at key sites (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). A comprehensive study of the species in Botswana was planned for 2007 (P. Hancock<em> in litt.</em> 2006), and 221 chicks were marked with patagial tags between 2006 and 2009 (Bridgeford 2009)<strong></strong>. In 2007, a survey began to  establish the extent of diclofenac use for  veterinary purposes in  Tanzania (BirdLife International 2007)<strong></strong>,  and in 2008 an  awareness-raising campaign at a conference of the World  Organisation for  Animal Health in Senegal led to a resolution  being  adopted unanimously  by more than 160 delegates to ""request Members to  consider their  national situation with the aim to seek  measures to  find solutions to  the problems caused by the administration  of  diclofenac in livestock""  (Woodford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to respond to and neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 2008 feeding stations were set up in the south of Egypt, at Shalatin, following the decline of vultures in the area (H. Ibrahim <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;The species is listed as locally Vulnerable in Namibia (Simmons and Brown 2015), Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan 2015), and Critically Endangered in the National red list for Uganda (WCS 2016).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Organise coordinated surveys and monitoring throughout its range to clarify population size and decline rates. Conduct further ecological research (Brown 1986, <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997, Shobrak in press<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>. Initiate awareness campaigns aimed at farmers, local communities, developers and ecotourists to reduce mortality from persecution, accidental poisoning and disturbance (Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Harrison&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, <strong></strong><strong></strong>Barnes 2000, Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005, Shobrak 2011, Shobrak in press). There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies in Namibia (Craig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Identify important nesting areas (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Carry out research into the effects of nest disturbance (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005) and nest loss (Murn <em>in prep.</em>). Improve awareness amongst utilities and NGOs of hazardous pylon designs and suitable measures to prevent collisions through training courses and literature such as posters and best practice manuals (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Increase awareness amongst farmers of suitable reservoir and drinking trough modification methods (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Enforce legislation concerned with incorrect use of poisons and pesticides (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Carry out research into the impacts of different poisons across its range (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Study the impact of the species on livestock numbers and share information with stakeholders (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Enact legislation against the persecution of the species (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Encourage vulture feeding sites and the abandonment of livestock carcasses from death by natural causes (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Provide enforcement for existing nature reserves in West Africa and design of a new one in northern Mali<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Thiollay 2006)<strong></strong>. In West Africa, determine the severity of accidental poisoning, hunting of the species for medicine and cultural reasons, hunting for food, and the threat from the development of powerlines (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). Complete a vulture census for West Africa (Anderson 2005)<strong></strong>. Eliminate the veterinary  use of diclofenac and other toxic drugs in  Africa.&#160;A number of recommendations were produced at the 2012 Pan-Africa Vulture Summit (Botha&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016): 1) Regulate import, manufacture and sale of poisons; 2) Legislate and enforce measures to prosecute those involved in illegal killing and trade in vulture species; 3) Protect and effectively manage breeding sites; 4) Ensure new energy infrastructure is ""vulture-friendly"" and modify existing unsafe infrastructure; 5) Support activities to conserve vulture populations, including research and outreach activities.

This species is therefore listed as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","This species inhabits open, arid and sparsely vegetated steppe and semi-desert (Launay <em>et al.</em> 1997, Osborne <em>et al.</em> 1997, Mian 2003, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003). It favours scattered shrubby vegetation, typically comprising xerophytic or halophytic plants (Collar 1996). Those wintering in Iran have been shown to prefer more densely vegetated bush-steppe to sparser shrub-steppe; however, within those bush-steppe habitats they favour areas with reduced vegetation cover (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Bush-steppe is thought to contain a higher abundance of food sources such as<em> Salsola</em> spp. and arthropods (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). Birds wintering in Iran also routinely visit neighbouring farmland where alfalfa and salad rocket is grown, but avoid pistachio crops (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although dense vegetation may provide a sanctuary from danger, as well as thermal protection when overnight temperatures drop in winter (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al.</em> 2010), more open, unvegetated areas are often favoured as night-time roosts in order to minimise the risk of ambush by nocturnal predators (Combreau and Smith 1997). On the breeding grounds, nesting females may also favour sites away from vegetation patches, which could provide cover for predators (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2012). Abundance of breeding males has been found to be higher in flat areas with shorter shrub vegetation which is likely to be more suitable for displaying (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<br/><p>The species feeds throughout the day, but is most active at dawn and dusk (Combreau and Launay 1996). It has an eclectic diet, mainly comprising plants and invertebrates (especially ants Formicidae and beetles Tenebrionidae: Tigar and Osborne 2000), but also including vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, small snakes and even young birds (Collar 1996, Tourenq <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/></p><p>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996). Males play no part in rearing the young, and a brood may contain young sired by several different individuals (Lesobre <em>et al</em>. 2010). Females create a shallow scrape in the ground in which they typically lay 3-4 eggs, and occasionally up to six eggs in long-distance migrants (Collar 1996, Combreau <em>et al</em>. 2002). The incubation period is typically 24 days, whilst fledging takes around 35 days.<br/></p><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting (primarily using falconry), largely but not exclusively on the species's wintering grounds (Judas <em>et al. </em>2009). Large numbers are also trapped, mainly in Pakistan and Iran, and shipped to Arabia for use in the training of falcons (Combreau 2007); hunting and trapping are responsible for more than 50% of mortality in Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;In 2014 an illegal shipment of 240 birds was intercepted en route from Pakistan to Bahrain (Shafaeipour <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Arab countries, the meat of this species is considered an aphrodisiac, attracting hunters of high status (Nabi <em>et al., </em>2019); in 2017-2019, permits for hunting of the Asian Houbara were given by Pakistan to royal Arabs, and unregulated hunting seems to be continuing. Eggs are also collected during the breeding season (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021). In recent years the species has been heavily hunted in Iraq, as the country has opened up to visits by hunters from other countries (R. Porter&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>In parts of the region, fast-paced development related to the growth of the petroleum industry has reduced the availability of undisturbed habitats and further exacerbated the species's decline. Oil exploration, road building, oil and water pipelines, mining and quarrying activities, powerlines and the general disturbance caused by four-wheel drive vehicles have all been identified as significant auxiliary threats.  Powerlines in particular may be a significant threat (M. Koshkin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Preliminary data from Uzbekistan suggests that powerlines may contribute to species mortality (Burnside <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Livestock grazing is reported to have a negative impact on the species, both indirectly, by degrading the desert vegetation on which birds rely for food and concealment, and directly, through the trampling of nests and disturbance of nesting females (Lavee 1988). Recent research on the effects of pastoralism on this species in the Kyzylkum Desert in Uzbekistan, however, has found that low intensity livestock grazing may not widely degrade rangelands at a landscape scale (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has no effect on male abundance and female nesting success (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b). In Iran, loss of habitat to croplands, mainly through the planting of pistachio, has been judged to be a significant threat (Mansoori 2006); however, it has also been found that the species exploits other crops such as alfalfa and salad rocket (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Yousefi (2017) reported a high degree of dependence on habitats in the vicinity of croplands, with habitats more than 6 km away losing their suitability. In Saudi Arabia, eggs and nests are predated by a range of mammalian predators (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p>Habitat modelling and climate projections predict an increase in suitable habitat in the future, including shifts in geographic distribution of suitable habitat (Yousefi <em>et al., </em>2017); however, the probability of chick survival may decrease in areas with relatively higher temperatures (Koshkin <em>et al., </em>2016), and higher mortality has been reported from Iran in harsh wintering conditions (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).<br/><br/>The primary conservation approach for this species has been captive-breeding and release, however this may be unsustainable and detrimental to wild populations. Over reliance on supplementation of wild populations with captive-bred individuals risks domestication and replacement, rather than conservation reinforcement, with the potential of release of less-fit individuals causing a long-term reduction in the size, genetic diversity and viability of wild populations (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018). With the current extent of unregulated harvest, one model reports that wild populations would require releasing over 3000 captive-bred females a year, more than the initial wild stock, to attain population stabilisation (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018).&#160;Releasing captive-bred stock may also create the allusion that mitigation measures are successful, which can lead to increased hunting pressure.","The population was last estimated to be between 78,960 and 97,000 individuals globally (O. Combreau&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014, BirdLife International 2014), and stated as poorly known in 2016 (BirdLife International). Studies since have primarily focused on nest site selection and reintroduced populations; available data on breeding parameters of wild populations are insufficient (Azar&#160;<em>et al.,&#160;</em>2018). Accurately establishing the global population is extremely challenging. The population is expected to fall within the population band for 50,000-99,999 individuals, which is assumed to equate to c.33,000-67,000 mature individuals. The breeding population in Kazakhstan has been estimated at c.49,000 individuals (Riou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;extends from <strong>Egypt</strong> east of the Nile, through <strong>Israel</strong>, <strong>Palestine</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Yemen</strong>, <strong>Oman</strong>, <strong>U.A.E.</strong>, <strong>Bahrain</strong>, <strong>Qatar</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Kuwait</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> and <strong>Mongolia</strong> to<strong> China</strong>.

The species is considered Critically Endangered on the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015). Studies have been conducted into the status, ecology and migration of the species in various parts of its range, most notably Kazakhstan (Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002, Tourenq <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt</em><em>.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004, Riou <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Uzbekistan (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016a,b). Through its network of breeding facilities in the U.A.E., Morocco and Kazakhstan, the International Fund for Houbara Conservation (IFHC) has a long-term goal to produce 35,000 Asian Houbaras each year for reintroduction into the wild (IFHC 2014). The first releases were made in Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in central Saudi Arabia in 1991. This population is currently estimated to number 250–300 individuals. Further releases have taken place elsewhere in Saudi  Arabia (including at Saja Umm ar Rimth with c.50 individuals [M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016]) and also in U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Yemen, Jordan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. By the end of 2016, 13,504 houbara had been released into the UAE (Azar <em>et al., </em>2018). It is not yet clear what impact the releases of captive-reared birds have on the demographics and genetic integrity of the overall population,&#160;however according to Burnside <em>et al.</em> (2016), in order to compensate for the loss of wild adults to hunting, the number of released birds may need to be as much as 10 times higher than hunting quotas. At least three birds have been satellite tracked from Saudi Arabia to the breeding grounds in Kazakhstan (Zafar-ul Islam <em>et al</em>. 2014). The CMS Asian Houbara Agreement (2005) urges all range countries to take necessary measures to prevent the extinction of any population of Houbara and maintain a favourable status.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The most urgently needed conservation measures are those that will reduce exploitation to a biologically sustainable level. This will require precautionary and scientifically determined limits on the number of birds that can be harvested legally and stricter enforcement of bans on illegal forms of trade and hunting; it also requires in-depth studies of natural productivity in Asian Houbaras in relation to habitat selection and predator abundance. Carry out further surveys to gain an improved estimate of the overall population size and trend; continue research to determine the migration routes, schedules and strategies of all populations. Survey the species throughout the wintering range (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Produce a range-wide action and recovery plan, based on agreement under the Convention on Migratory Species; the CMS Asian Houbara Agreement has been drafted but has not been opened for signature. Develop and implement national and regional species action plans (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Create managed protected areas and review current protected areas. For example, approximately 85% of suitable habitat are outside the existing protected area network of Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;Where they can be shown to be detrimental, reduce grazing and other farming pressures (Goriup 1997, Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004). Establish long-term, range-wide population monitoring studies. Study the overall demographic and genetic consequences of releasing captive-reared birds. Engage local communities in the protection of houbara through education, such as is provided by the IFHC, and through entrepreneurship developments like ecotourism (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;<br/><p></p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Recent data suggests the already small population is declining at an extremely rapid rate owing to a variety of threats including poisoning, persecution and ecosystem alterations. The species has a very small population and local extinctions may be accelerated by major poisoning events in isolated localised subpopulations.<p></p>","It prefers mixed, dry woodland at low altitudes, avoiding semi-arid thornbelt areas (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It also occurs up to 4,000 m in Ethiopia, and perhaps 3,000 m in Kenya, and ranges across the thorny <em>Acacia</em>-dominated landscape of Botswana (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It generally avoids human habitation (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. The species is thought to be a long-lived resident that maintains a territory (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994, Murn and Holloway 2014)<strong></strong>. It may generally fly lower than other vultures, and is often the first vulture species to arrive at carcasses (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. While it is often found on the periphery of vulture congregations at large carcasses, it is also often found at small carcasses and is probably an occasional predator (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, Murn 2014, F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. It nests and roosts in trees, most nests being in <em>Acacia</em> spp. or baobabs (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is one, the egg being laid a couple of months after rains have finished and the dry season is underway (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Pairs that breed have a success rate of 65-75% (Hustler and Howells 1988, Murn and Holloway 2014), however, up to 61% of pairs do not attempt to breed each year (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994), often due to the presence of a dependent chick from the previous breeding season (Murn and Holloway 2014)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Reductions in populations of medium-sized mammals and wild ungulates, as well as habitat conversion through agricultural intensification and development throughout its range best explain the current decline (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 1999, R. Davies <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>. Additional threats include indirect poisoning (R. Davies <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong> at baits set to kill jackals in small-stock farming areas, and  in East Africa at poisoned baits set for larger mammalian carnivores such as lions and hyenas (C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012),<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span> and, particularly in East Africa, secondary poisoning from carbofuran and other poisons (Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). Deliberate poisoning to prevent vultures drawing attention to poaching activities has also been documented (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2016). 17 White-headed Vultures were killed in a mass poisoning event in Botswana in 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Exploitation for the international trade in raptors (N. Baker <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong> also poses a threat. In 2005, 30 individuals of this species were confiscated by the Italian authorities (F. Genero<em> in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa (Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015). In South Africa, this species is captured for use in traditional medicines (R. E. Simmons and C. J. Brown <em>in litt.</em> 2006) and in Zambia White-headed Vultures have apparently been intentionally killed for use in witchcraft (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012).&#160;Breeding birds may readily desert nests in areas of high human disturbance (R. E. Simmons and C. J. Brown <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. The species is highly sensitive to land-use and is highly concentrated in protected areas (Hancock 2008). Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species, although livestock have not been recorded as a potential food source for this species (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","An old estimate of 7,000-12,500 mature individuals was extrapolated from a number of regional estimates. This equates to 10,500-18,750 individuals in total. However, a new estimate of the global population suggests the population is much smaller, consisting of just 5,500 individuals (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2016). This equates to just 3,685 mature individuals here placed in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;has an extremely large range in sub-Saharan Africa (from <strong>Senegal</strong>, <strong>Gambia </strong>and <strong>Guinea-Bissau</strong> disjunctly east to <strong>Eritrea</strong>, <strong>Ethiopia </strong>and <strong>Somalia</strong>, and south to easternmost <strong>South Africa</strong> and <strong>Eswatini</strong>), where it is uncommon, but generally widespread outside forested regions (Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>.

New data suggests the regional populations are now much smaller than was previously thought: 721 nests in East Africa; 548 nests in Central Africa; 468 nests in Southern Africa and 156 nests in West Africa (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2016). In <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Botswana</span> only four nests were located during gyrocopter surveys of three Important Bird Areas during 2008 and the species has the lowest relative abundance of the vulture species recorded (Hancock 2008), while in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Niger </span>there are only four records since 1995, all in the Gadabeji area (J.

It is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;Individuals were marked with patagial tags in Fouta Djallon vulture sanctuary, Guinea, in 2007 to monitor movements and for a toxicological assessment of the vulture population of the park (Rondeau 2008). Additional studies to monitor the movement of individuals within and between protected areas is under way in South Africa (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 2007, a survey began to  establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in  Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>, and in 2008 an  awareness-raising campaign at a conference of the World Organisation for  Animal Health in Senegal led to a resolution  being adopted unanimously  by more than 160 delegates to ""request Members to consider their  national situation with the aim to seek  measures to find solutions to  the problems caused by the administration  of diclofenac in livestock""  (Woodford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008).&#160;At the 2014 Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species, a set of guidelines to address poisoning was formally adopted (Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are   currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning   teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to  respond  to and neutralise poisoned carcasses (C.

The majority of its range lies outside Europe where it was not thought to be declining at a sufficiently rapid rate to approach the threshold for Vulnerable. However recent information suggests that the population outside Europe may be exposed to greater threats than was previously thought and has also undergone very rapid recent declines across much of the range. It is therefore classified as Endangered.<p></p>,"It inhabits areas of steppe and semi-desert, and is recorded breeding up to 2,300 m in mountainous regions (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;It feeds mainly on small mammals on its breeding grounds, with susliks forming the vast majority of its diet in some areas; when wintering it appears to feed mainly on mole rats in East Africa, and termites and Red-billed Quelea&#160;<em>Quelea quelea</em>&#160;predominate in southern Africa (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;Nests have traditionally been built as large platforms on the ground, although recent habitat alterations seem to have caused a shift to building a few metres higher in bushes or trees (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). It also nests on artificial structures and will occur on rubbish grounds and waste sites (Keijmel 2019).&#160;The species is migratory, with birds wintering in south-east Africa and southern Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrants leave their breeding grounds between August and October/November, returning between January and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Subedi 2014). It avoids sea crossings and thus forms large concentrations at bottleneck sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","The species has declined in the west of its breeding range, including extirpation from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, as a result of the conversion of steppes to agricultural land combined with direct persecution (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Boesman 2013).&#160;It is also adversely affected by power lines and is very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (STRIX 2012, Meyburg and Boesman 2013). It was recently found to be the raptor most frequently electrocuted by power lines in a study in western Kazakhstan (Levin and Kurkin 2013) and in Saudi Arabia (Shobrak <em>et al. </em>2021). Three sets of factors have been identified as having detrimental impacts on the species in Russia and Kazakhstan: increased mortality owing to collisions with power lines, pesticide poisoning and direct persecution; a reduction in the area of suitable habitat and availability of food, historically due to overgrazing but now due to undergrazing, and to a lesser extent logging and mining; poor breeding success owing to destruction of nests and juvenile mortality during spring fires, entanglement of nestlings in artificial nest materials, and disturbance by people and livestock (Strategy of the Steppe Eagle Conservation in the Russian Federation 2016). Young eagles are taken out of the nest in order to sell them to western European countries (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). Recent studies using social media to assess impacts on wildlife found that the species was also being illegally killed in Jordan, of which the species is legally protected in the country (Eid and Handal 2018). A decline in the number of birds and a reduction in the proportion of juveniles migrating over Eilat, Israel began immediately after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, leading Yosef and Fornadari (2004) to suggest that the species may have been affected by radioactive contamination. This species is vulnerable to the veterinary drug diclofenac (Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014), which was intensively used in the species's wintering range in Pakistan and India (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004).","Combined totals from across the whole range estimate the number of pairs at 31,372 (26,014-36,731), which equates to 62,744 (52,028-73,462) mature individuals or 94,116 (78,042-110,193) individuals (I.

Those breeding at lower latitudes or in the Southern Hemisphere tend to be resident (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean. Most birds travel singly or in pairs, even on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits an extreme variety of habitats, tolerating wet and dry, hot and cool climates, from sea level up to c.4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> Birds make up most of its diet, principally pigeons and doves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Eggs are usually laid in a scrape or depression in a rock face, with no nest being built (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Populations recovered following the ban of harmful hydrocarbons in most countries, which appears important to the birds’ survival (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Historically, the species was affected by shooting in the U.K., notably during the Second World War (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Persecution throughout its range was the major threat in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Snow and Perrins 1998). While persecution has decreased significantly since the species received legal protection, illegal persecution still occurs in some areas, for example four Peregrines were confirmed illegally poisoned and nine shot, trapped, or nests destroyed in the UK in 2014 (RSPB 2014). Severe population declines in the 1960s-1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Rock climbing activities may pose a threat to the species's nest sites (Global Raptor Information Network 2015), and careless methods of field study may result in abandonment of eggs (White <em>et al. </em>2020). In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). In North Africa, the main threat to the species is illegal trapping and collection of nestlings for use in falconry (Garrido <em>et al. in prep</em>). It is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012), and collision or electrocution from electricity cables may be common in some areas (White <em>et al. </em>2020). An oil spill in northern Spain was thought to have reduced reproductive success and caused adult mortality in the local population (Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2006). Urban fledglings are at threat from collisions with cars, windows and other man-made objects (White <em>et al. </em>2020). Warming of sea temperatures may reduce plankton and associated seabirds that serve as a food source for some populations of Peregrine Falcons (Nelson &amp; Myres 1976).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020) estimate the population in the USA/ Canada to be c.72,000 individuals. The North African population is estimated to be 2,290-2,900 pairs (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>). The European population is estimated at 16,100-31,100 pairs, which equates to 32,200-62,100 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms approximately 13% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 248,000-478,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

Birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October, arriving at wintering quarters from late October onwards. The return journey begins in March and April, and breeding territories are occupied again in May and June.&#160; Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs or family groups, even on migration, with larger groups being rare except at roosts and especially rich feeding sites (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It migrates in broad fronts and does not generally concentrate at narrow sea crossings as do many other migratory raptors (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is mainly diurnal although partly crepuscular and even nocturnal to some extent on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>It occurs in open wooded areas, and has been recorded up to 4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> Flying insects form the main part of its diet, although birds are often taken in the breeding season (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Birds almost always nest in trees, using abandoned nests of other raptors or corvids (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> The species requires trees in which to nest, so although preferring generally open areas in the breeding season it will avoid those that are completely deforested (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","<p>The cutting of old growth forest patches in Ukraine is thought to have caused local declines (Orta <em>et al. </em>2020). Agricultural intensification poses a threat through removal of nesting trees and reduction of prey availability such as insects and farmland birds (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001). Shooting is a significant cause of mortality during migration, notably in Malta where hunters are thought to kill 500-600 individuals each year (Sultana 1996, cited in Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001). A growing threat is human disturbance associated with silvicultural and hunting activities during the breeding season (Sergio&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001).&#160;Pesticide use has likely had only minor impacts, as has egg-collecting, which tends to be a local issue (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Large increases in Goshawk populations in some countries has led to higher predation rates of both Eurasian Hobby and corvid species, causing direct mortality and reducing the availability of nest sites (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2001).

Migratory birds winter in southern Africa and southern Asia; northern birds leave their breeding grounds in September and return in March and April, and those breeding in South Africa move northwards in March and return in August (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrants are thought to partially cross water on a broad front (assumed from regular occurrence on islands across the Mediterranean), but nevertheless many pass through bottleneck short crossing points each season. Birds tend to be seen singly or in pairs, and even on migration rarely form groups of more than five, and stay away from other raptors (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds soar c.200-300 m above the ground when hunting (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat </strong>It is a species of open woodland, preferring patches of forest interspersed with open areas; it is recorded up to 3,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Small birds are the most important part of its diet (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built in trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>A mixture of woodland and open areas such as agricultural fields is optimal for this species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Threats affecting the species include habitat degradation, direct persecution and human disturbance (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta and Boesman 2013).

In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing, and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). The accumulation of organochloride pesticides in wintering areas may affect the species’s reproductive success (Tucker and Heath 1994).&#160;In the past, organochlorine contamination may have been a contributory factor in the population decline in south-east Spain (Martinez-Lopez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012). Powerlines were responsible for 19.5% of Booted Eagles mortalities in Spain during 1990-2006, with the number of cases increasing throughout the period (Martinez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In the same study, illegal killing was responsible for 32.5% of mortalities, however the number of cases decreased significantly during the study period. The majority (19.5%) of killings were shootings, however nest robbing and captivity, trapping, and poisoning also occurred (Martinez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Poaching was also identified as a threat in Armenia, primarily due to fears over them killing domestic birds such as chickens and pigeons (Aghababyan &amp; Stepanyan 2020). Several Booted Eagles were shot during migration on Malta in 2016 (RSPB 2017). The trade of this species in Moroccan markets has been reported (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>).

There have been observations of occasional  roosts in tree hollows ( e.g. in New South Wales, Churchill 2008). It  forages for insects in rainforest, vine thicket <em>Melaleuca </em>swamps,  coastal forest, and wet anddry sclerophyll forests (Bonaccorso 1998,  Churchill 2008, Hoye and Hall 2008). In the Philippines, the species is  dependent on caves (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998, Esselstyn <em>et al.</em>  2004) where it forages over the canopy in secondary and primary lowland  areas, including agricultural areas (Taylor 1934, Sanborn 1952, Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1991, Rickart <em>et al.</em>  1993, Lepiten 1995). Captures in harp traps placed in along creekbeds  (including creeks not flowing) have shown that they also fly below the  canopy in closed forests in Timor-Leste and Australia (K.N. Armstrong  unpublished), and foraging beneath the canopy has also been reported in  Papua New Guinea (Bonaccorso 1998). The species may migrate seasonally.  In Australia, they congregate in the summer months to form maternity  colonies, and disperse again in winter. Mating in Australia begins in  July, and implantation may be delayed, with females birthing a single  young in December. In the southern part of their range in Australia,  bats may go into shallow hibernation, where they rouse frequently  throughout the season to forage. They sometimes congregate with other  species of <em>Miniopterus</em>, and the warm conditions in these shared cave  roosts allows them to extend their southern extent in Australia. They  eat mostly beetles, moths and flies, but spiders can also make up close  to a third of their diet (Churchill 2008). Across their range, the  characteristic frequency of their echolocation calls is between c. 52–60  kHz (Reinhold <em>et al.</em> 2001, Armstrong and Aplin 2011, Pennay and Lavery 2017).","Across its range there are various activities that threaten the integrity of roost sites and disturb colonies, including limestone quarrying, land modification associated with other mining activity, and guano mining. If caves are left intact, individuals may reoccupy roosts when disturbances cease, but in most cases, there is too little information on the size of colonies and long-term trends in colony size to justify an assumption that some disturbances are temporary and have no effect. The removal of natural forest habitat also reduces the foraging habitat of this and other <em>Miniopterus </em>species.","It is generally a common species. Maternity colonies of thousands of  individuals may be encountered (Flannery 1995). In the Philippines, the  species is common in habitat with caves (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998). It  is also common in Sabah and elsewhere in Indonesia. The largest summer  breeding colony at Mt Etna in Australia in a limestone cave has been  estimated at over 100,000 individuals, which is estimated as 80% of the  breeding population in Australia.

The Australian  Commonwealth Government listed this species in May 2016 as Vulnerable  under Australia’s national environmental legislation. This species has  also been upgraded to Endangered in 2017 under Queensland state  legislation.","<em>Macroderma gigas </em>is the second-largest echolocating species of bat in  the world, and the largest in Australia, weighing up to 150 g and having  a wingspan of 60 cm. They are present in a wide variety of habitats,  from the arid, rocky landscapes of the Pilbara region in Western  Australia, to tropical savanna woodlands and rainforests further north  and east. They rely on underground roosts with warm, humid microclimates  to maintain their heat and water balance (they do not enter torpor,  Leitner and Nelson 1967, Baudinette <em>et al.</em> 2000), especially in the more arid regions or at drier times of the year and during breeding (Pettigrew <em>et al.</em>  1986, Churchill and Helman 1990, Churchill 1991, Armstrong and Anstee  2000). As a result, roost availability is restricted to relatively few  subterranean structures, though individuals are sometimes found in old  mines and caves with cooler and drier conditions. Roosts in natural  caves are found commonly in the deeper limestone caves, tower karst and  sinkholes, sandstone formations, granite boulder piles and ironstone  landscapes (Toop 1985, Armstrong and Anstee 2000, K.N. Armstrong  unpublished data).<br/><br/>This species is carnivorous–their diet consists  of small mammals (including other bats), birds, reptiles, frogs and  large insects, though it can vary according to region and the seasonal  availability of some prey types, and the proportion of larger  invertebrates can be high (Pettigrew <em>et al.</em> 1986, Schulz 1986, Boles 1999, Claramunt <em>et al.</em>  2019). They forage either by perching in vegetation and ambushing  passing prey in the air or on the ground, or by gleaning surfaces,  including the ground. Echolocation calls are short and strongly  multi-harmonic, as is typical of the family. They also make several  social calls that are audible to humans (‘chirps’, ‘squabbles’ and  ‘twitters’, Kulzer <em>et al.</em> 1984, Guppy <em>et al.</em> 1985, Pettigrew <em>et al.</em>  1986), though there is an unresolved issue over whether some ultrasonic  non-echolocation calls attributed to them in the Pilbara (McKenzie and  Bullen 2009) are derived exclusively from other cave-roosting bats (K.N.  Armstrong unpublished data). Previous studies in Queensland have shown  that foraging areas were an average of 1.9 km from roosts and 62 ha in  size (Tidemann <em>et al.</em> 1985), though their wing morphology and the  size of some colonies suggests they are capable of a much greater  nightly range (Bullen and McKenzie 2002). Most prey is taken to a  feeding perch in trees, rock overhangs, or cave entrances to be  consumed, and feeding sites can be relatively common compared to diurnal  roost sites.<br/><br/>Females mostly give birth to a single young, although  pregnant females with twins in utero have been trapped in the Northern  Territory (Hanrahan <em>et al.</em> unpublished), and most females breed by two  years of age (Hoyle <em>et al.</em> 2001). Parturition occurs over a month  commencing in mid-October, and young can be shifted to other caves as  caves became warmer as summer progresses. Juvenile bats commence flying  at seven weeks with all young capable of flight by the end of January  (Toop 1985). Females have high fidelity to their natal roosts, with  males having a greater tendency to disperse (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1999). Relatively few breeding sites are known, and most are not explicitly protected or managed (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1997, Armstrong and Anstee 2000, Richards <em>et al.</em> 2008, Worthington Wilmer 2012). Generation time is estimated at 8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).","A variety of threats to the survival of this species have been  identified as currently operating or having the potential to cause  decline (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). <em>Macroderma gigas</em> is very  vulnerable to disturbance in its roost sites, and will readily fly into  daylight following the casual entry of the public or searches by  biologists, where it is vulnerable to predation by raptors and general  exposure to the external environment. Some of the known roosts readily  accessible by people are not managed. Bats may not return to a roost for  months or years after trapping activity, depending on how this is  undertaken. The most serious threat is the loss of roost sites, which  can occur from a variety of causes. Renewed interest in economic  reserves of remaining ore beneath historical mine workings has the  potential to cause disturbances and loss of habitat, and there has been  recent evidence of this in the Pilbara region. There is also an  increasing level of encroachment on cave roosts in ironstone habitats by  surface mining and associated exploration activity. The collapse,  flooding and blocking of entrances are realistic sources of potential  catastrophic loss to the large colonies that have been established in  historical and disused gold and copper mines. There has also been recent  evidence that cane toads contribute to the mortality of <em>M. gigas</em>, and  there are other unknown factors that appear to have caused very recent  but patchy declines in the Northern Territory (White <em>et al.</em> 2016). Genetic studies have demonstrated that it is potentially susceptible to cane toad toxin (Shine <em>et al.</em>  2016). Entanglement in barbed wire fences is known to have caused local  declines in the Pilbara after the ongoing entanglement of entire small  colonies (Armstrong and Anstee 2000). Pollution in old mines and an  unidentified herpes virus have also been identified as possible threats  (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). For the populations at the southern  limits of the species' range, the general paucity of suitable roost  sites, the geographic distance between existing colonies, and the  evident complete lack of gene flow indicates that these populations are  totally isolated and will not be rescued by immigration or recolonised  should local extinctions occur (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1999).  They can be captured inadvertently in pit traps used for small  terrestrial vertebrate surveys, depending on the width of the pit mouth  (Diete <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Population genetic studies showed that while <em>M. gigas</em> is distributed  widely over northern Australia, it occurs as a collection of population  isolates in several regions, including the Pilbara and Kimberley regions  of Western Australia, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and three  groups in Queensland (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999). The  structuring of populations is partly a consequence of the highly  philopatric nature of females, which seldom move from their natal  roosts. Further population genetic studies have revealed the effect of  roost philopatry within regions, which also promotes population  structuring on a smaller scale (K N. Armstrong <em>et al.</em> unpublished).<br/><br/>It  is relatively straightforward to make verifiable counts of<em> Macroderma  gigas </em>as they leave their roosts in caves and mines, especially with  video recordings. There has been no systematic approach for census, but  counts or estimates have been made at several extant colonies over the  past two decades. Colonies in natural caves typically comprise isolated  individuals or small groups of up to <em>ca</em> 30 individuals. Disused mines  can provide a refuge for several hundred individuals. The largest colony  has been recorded in a horizontal adit at Pine Creek in the Northern  Territory - historical counts were 1,200-1,500 individuals, but more  recent estimates with video technology gave a count of around 550  individuals. The largest recorded colonies are all in disused mines,  some of which have probably disappeared. Various estimates of total  population size have been advanced based on a combination of counts at  some roosts, plus calculations based on Area of Occupancy, but there is  no robust measure of abundance across the full range (summarised in  Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). Totals differ between authors, with  Worthington Wilmer (2012) suggesting somewhere between 4,000 - 6,000, and  the previous IUCN Red List account containing an estimate of 7,000-9,000  (McKenzie and Hall 2008) - but all agree that there are less than 10,000  individuals in existence.",Decreasing,"<em>Macroderma gigas</em> is endemic to Australia, though there is an unverified  record in Papua New Guinea (Filewood 1983). It ranges across northern  Australia, from the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia,  the Top End of the Northern Territory, with scattered colonies in the  Gulf Coastal and Mount Isa Inlier bioregions, the eastern side of Cape  York Peninsula, and a few localities in central-eastern Queensland  (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are many sites in central  Australia where the species has declined since European arrival, as is  evident from historical sightings and subfossil remains, plus numerous  other sites containing fossils (reviews in Molnar <em>et al.</em> 1984, Churchill and Helman 1990, Armstrong and Anstee 2000).",,Terrestrial,"<em>Macroderma gigas</em> occurs on numerous conservation reserves, but there are  also many known colonies that do not occur on lands that are managed  for wildlife or that are subject to scrutiny, including both pastoral  stations and small-scale mining or exploration leases. There is good  potential for effective conservation of this species and ameliorating  declines if efforts can be coordinated under a national recovery and  management plan, and with resource allocation and partnership amongst  government, industry and researchers. A programme of standardised  non-invasive monitoring at key roost sites would be helpful for  informing regional and local management approaches (Armstrong and Anstee  2000; Armstrong 2010, 2011; Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is a  need for priority attention on colonies in old, disused mine  adits-requiring scrutiny, protection and repair of sites and solutions  to allow sharing of underground structures between the interest of both  mining and bats. The encroachment of iron ore mining on roost habitat in  Western Australia is well regulated but would benefit from further  information about the effectiveness of buffer zones, the potential for  artificial roost habitat creation (as a measure of last resort), the  size, seasonal occupancy and breeding status of local occurrences in  project areas, and regional context to aid risk assessment and  management. There is also good awareness of the need for unbarbed top  strands of wire on livestock fences in the Pilbara, and mining companies  consider the risk of entanglements for fences on their leases,  particularly around new infrastructure. The outcomes from population  genetic studies need to be part of management and conservation  responses, in particular information about female site fidelity and the  distinctiveness of the population isolates. Postgraduate research into  acoustic ecology is underway and will resolve issues regarding their  acoustic identification. There are several captive colonies in zoos and  wildlife parks, which are bred and managed for genetic diversity. <em>M.  gigas</em> was only recently specially protected under national environmental  legislation in Australia, reversing a previous delisting that has  diverted attention away from this species that is deserving of better  consideration.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

There are observations of past hunting activity that have contributed to a decline, possibly on more than one occasion. Although there is no firm evidence of continuing decline, there is evidence for major fluctuations in the population residing at the primary known roost site. Area of occupancy (not including foraging dispersal range) is less than 10 km², the distribution is severely fragmented, and there is believed to be a continuing threat to the major known population through traditional hunting. Unless the species is confirmed to persist in additional parts of its potential range, it is considered to be at high risk of extinction in the near future.</p>","All known contemporary or recent occurrences are in areas of rugged limestone karst with largely intact forest cover. The documented elevational range of <em>c</em>. 500–2,400 m spans the habitat categories of Hill Forest, Lower Montane and Upper Montane Forests. The dentition and other features of the species indicate that it is frugivorous. The individual shot near Taman Village was visiting a fig tree (<em>Ficus </em>sp.) in an old garden area (Flannery 1995).<br/><br/>The two confirmed cave roosts are both associated with precipitous sinkholes that afford some protection from local hunters. At Luplupwintem an adult female was collected carrying a dependent young in May 1992. In PNG the closely related Bare-backed Fruit Bat (<em>Dobsonia moluccensis</em>) also favours inaccessible roost sites in areas where there is a risk of human hunting. However, in northern Australia (Churchill 1998) and in parts of PNG that are remote from human habitation (K.P. Aplin unpublished) they roost in many different situations, including large and small sinkholes, caves, fissures and rock overhangs, tree hollows, and in variable-sized groups ranging from a dozen or so individuals up to congregations of many thousands. There is some landowner testimony to suggest that large congregations are seasonal phenomena, perhaps associated with breeding activity. However, females with newborn young or in advanced stages of pregnancy have also been observed using small caves and fissures, even when larger systems are present in the same local area. Accordingly, it seems likely that <em>Dobsonia moluccensis </em>(and by extension, <em>Aproteles bulmerae</em>) are not restricted by physiological factors to any particular type of roost but select roost sites based on various criteria that includes the risk of predation.<br/><br/>All pteropodids including <em>Dobsonia moluccensis </em>(Dwyer 1975, Churchill 1998) give birth to single young. Gestation period in Australian populations of <em>Dobsonia </em>is <em>c</em>. 5 months and weaning occurs at around 5–6 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained in the second year. Similar parameters can be safely assumed for <em>Aproteles bulmerae</em>.<br/><br/>Nothing is known about patterns of movement in either <em>Aproteles bulmerae </em>or <em>Dobsonia moluccensis</em>. Other similar-sized species of <em>Pteropus </em>are known to travel at speeds of 40 km/hr and to travel several 10s of kilometres to visit preferred food resources. However, many of the relevant studies have been carried out in highly modified landscapes where resources are fragmented and scattered, and the same pattern of dispersal may not apply in areas of continuous forest cover.","Hunting and disturbance in roost sites is the primary threat to<em> A. bulmerae</em>. Large cave-roosting bats are desirable targets for subsistence hunting in PNG because it is sometimes possible to kill many animals in a short period of time, especially if shotguns are available. The population at Luplupwintem was apparently decimated by groups of hunters with shotguns in the late 1970s. The closely-related <em>Dobsonia moluccensis </em>has been observed to abandon a cave roost after a hunting event, presumably to relocate elsewhere in one or more alternative roosts (K.P. Aplin, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The likelihood of hunting and roost visitation is increased with the development of new roads. Wopkaimin landowners interviewed by Ken Aplin in 2013 reported an increase in the volume of foot traffic between the Telefomin Valley to the north of the Hindenburg Range and Tabubil to the south, and they voiced concerns that this might lead to increased visitation to Luplupwintem, including visits not authorised by landowners. The same informants also mentioned a regular foot traffic across the nearby and largely unpatrolled international border with Papua Province of Indonesia, some it associated with the sale of airguns and ammunition, and potentially of other weapons.<br/><br/>Conditions that adversely affect feeding habitat on a broad-scale have the potential to reduce the usage of local cave roosts. Forests on the Hindenburg Range in the vicinity of Luplupwintem suffered die-back during the El Nino drought of 1997–1998 and some areas were further affected by subsequent wildfires. A large wildfire had swept just north of the Luplupwintem area shortly before 2001 (T.F. Flannery pers. comm.).","In 1992 and 1993 the population at Luplupwintem was estimated to 137 and 160 individuals respectively, based on direct counts of animals leaving the sinkhole (Flannery and Seri 1993). The site has not been assessed by a biologist since that time but in February 2013 Ken Aplin was told by landowners that the population had declined again after Flannery’s last visit, only to recover again, and that the cave once more contained bats. Whether these are Bulmer’s Fruit Bat or the morphologically similar Bare-backed Fruit Bat (<em>Dobsonia moluccensis</em>) is not known.<br/><br/>The Crater Mountain population was extant in 2005/2006 but no individuals have been observed since that time. There is no estimate of population size for the Crater Mountain locality.<br/><br/>It is not known whether or not the populations in the upper Fly River and middle Purari River catchments are extant. However, both regions are remote and receive low levels of human visitation, hence there is no reason to suggest their decline through human action.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to New Guinea and is recorded only from the eastern half of the island (Papua New Guinea). Living animals have been recorded at two sites in two widely separated localities, and recent skeletal remains have been found in two other areas. The known elevational range of the records now is from <em>c. </em>500 m to 2,400 m a.s.l. and includes areas of Hill Forest and Montane Forest. All known areas of current or recent occurrence are in areas of rugged limestone karst.<br/><br/>It<em> </em>was first described in 1977 from 12,000 year old fossil remains from Eastern Highlands Province of PNG. Unbeknown to the describer, living animals had been collected in 1975 by an anthropologist working in Western Province of PNG. These came from a sinkhole called Luplupwintem, close to the edge of the Hindenburg Wall and at an elevation of 2,400 m a.s.l. The first visit to Luplupwintem by biologists found only a few resident bats which had been visited shortly before by landowners armed with ropes and shotguns. Subsequent visits throughout the 1980s failed to record any bats. Tim Flannery of the Australian Museum and Lester Seri of the Papua New Guinea Wildlife Division (Flannery and Seri 1993) visited the cave in 1992 and 1993 and estimated the population to be 137 and 160 individuals in successive years. In the 1980s and 1990s the species was recorded from two sites in the Star Mountains region but the species is now no longer present.<br/><br/>In 1984 an individual was shot at night over a native garden at Taman Village, in the Telefomin valley (Flannery 1995). This locality is <em>c.</em> 32 km from Luplupwintem which seems an excessive overnight foraging distance from this site. If another, closer roost site is present in the Telefomin area, its location is not yet known. &#160;<br/><br/>In 1995 fresh skeletal remains were collected in Eastern Highlands Province—these were killed by a local hunter at the locality of Huavegemu Cave near the village of Herowana. Subsequently, skeletal remains of two more individuals were recorded in the same area which lies within Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area (CMWMA) (D.D. Wright pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In 2005-2006 University of Papua New Guinea student Kore Tau examined ten bat-occupied and four unoccupied caves and sinkholes in two distinct localities within CMWMA, twenty kilometers apart (surrounding Herowana and Supa). Among the ten roosting sites, living <em>Aproteles bulmerae </em>was confirmed as present (distinguished by both the lack of incisors and the presence of second digit claw; Bonaccorso 1998) in only one sinkhole near Herowana. This sinkhole is connected to the cave from which hunted remains had come (Wright <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Tau was able to net six individual <em>A. bulmerae</em> at this site, which also hosted roosting <em>Dobsonia</em>. Because the two species co-occurred a count could not be used to estimate the size of the <em>Aproteles </em>colony. At a second nearby sinkhole two possible <em>Aproteles </em>were netted but for these only the lack of incisors was noted, without examination for the developed claw. An analysis of environmental variables to find predictors for <em>Dobsonia</em>/<em>Aproteles </em>occupation indicated that difficulty of human access to the cave/sinkhole was the only solid predictor.<br/><br/>In 2011–2012 Kore Tau and Enock Kale of the PNG Institute of Biological Research searched and netted caves and sinkholes, and interviewed local hunters, at several sites in PNG including the Crater Supa area and sites near Mt. Karimui in Chimbu Province, Mekil-Mt. Stolle in Sandaun Province, and the Huon Peninsula in Morobe Province. They found no evidence of <em>A. bulmerae</em> on these trips.<br/><br/>Between 2011 and 2015 wildlife consultant Ken Aplin found the remains of <em>Aproteles bulmerae </em>in two additional areas of remote limestone karst in southern Papua New Guinea. One of these areas is in Western Province in the headwaters of the Fly River, with a local elevational range of 500–1150 m a.s.l. The other is in Gulf Province in the vicinity of the middle Purari River, with local elevational range of 100–550 m a.s.l. In each of these areas <em>Aproteles </em>remains were found among bones and teeth accumulated in caves by roosting owls (probably the Sooty Owl <em>Tyto tenebricosa</em>). In each case, the remains were judged to be recent, based on geomorphic criteria and the presence in two sites of a small number of recently regurgitated casts (these did not contain <em>Aproteles </em>remains). Two owl roosts were sampled in each of the areas and all roosts produced remains of <em>Aproteles</em>. At the two sites in Gulf Province the <em>Aproteles </em>remains are exclusively unerupted teeth derived from very young bats; the owls were most likely predating young bats left unattended at a nearby maternity roosts (the hunting range of the owls might extend a few kilometres from the roost). The two sites in Western Province contained the remains of subadult bats. In both areas the caves are remote from higher elevation country, hence the <em>Aproteles </em>were residing in areas of Hill Forest habitat. Both areas are characterised by moderately to extremely rugged karst terrain and support large tracts of undisturbed forest. Because of their remoteness it is unlikely that these populations have been subjected to any hunting activity in recent times. Unless they have declined for some natural reason, it is likely that they are extant. The known extant distribution of <em>Aproteles</em>, if limited to the areas immediately around the confirmed sites of Luplupwintem and the two Crater Mountain caves, is probably around 100–200 km².<br/><br/>However, the new records in the Fly and Purari catchments suggest a potentially broader distribution in the hinterland of the Gulf of Papua. Much of this country is extremely rugged karst terrain lying at 400–600 m a.sl., and it is very thinly populated, heavily forested and biologically poorly known. Similar low to mid-elevation karst terrain extends west into the Indonesian province of Papua. The contemporary occurrence of <em>Aproteles </em>in this region requires confirmation.",This species has been severely hunted for meat.,Terrestrial,"The Crater Mountain sites are within the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area and there is local community awareness of the conservation significance of this species.<br/><br/>The Luplupwintem site is currently unprotected and the majority of regional landowners seem to be unaware of the conservation significance of this species. Among Wopkaimin people there also seems to be a lack of awareness of the distinction between <em>Aproteles bulmerae </em>and the morphologically similar <em>Dobsonia moluccensis</em>. A failure to differentiate between these species presents a challenge to the effective conservation of the rarer species.<br/><br/>Areas of suitable habitat in adjacent areas of Papua Province, Indonesia, or to the east of Luplupwintem should be surveyed to locate any remaining colonies of this species. The status of the species in the Upper Fly River and Middle Purari River catchments needs to be reassessed and other areas of similar, low-elevation limestone karst in the hinterland of the Gulf of Papua also needs to be surveyed. Initial detection of the species through the examination of owl roost remains is an effective means of survey for the species in previously unsurveyed localities, especially where the location of potential roost caves is not known to landowners.<br/><br/>Efforts should be made to capture and non-invasively sample a small number of individuals at each of the known sites so that genetic methods can be applied to determine the extent of contemporary and past gene flow between the Luplupwintem and Crater Mountain populations, and to derive a long-term perspective on the demographic history of the species.<br/>If the species is found to be genuinely restricted to only a few isolated populations, a captive-breeding and reintroduction programme should be considered.

209539734,19589,Rhinonicteris aurantia,Least Concern,,2021,2016-07-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution across multiple regions of northern Australia, presence in a range of cave-bearing rocky landscapes, and presumed large population. There are persistent mining-related threats in the Pilbara region of Western Australia that have the potential reduce the size of the population there by more than 30% in the next two decades and to cause the loss of most known underground roosts in the next 50 years in the absence of mitigation (Armstrong 2011; Woinarski<em> et al</em>. 2014). However, while information on population size and the location of roost sites is poorly known in this region (Cramer <em>et al</em>. 2016), the species as a whole is considered to be secure. For cave-roosting bats that are reliant for their survival on suitable but relatively few roosts for half of every day, the area of occupancy is best considered as the total area of its roost sites only (excluding foraging habitat), given that area of occupancy can be defined as “the smallest area essential at any stage to the survival of existing populations of a taxon”. While this area is in the order of a few square kilometres and would probably allow a match to one of the highest threatened categories under Criterion B, the total number of known and inferred roost locations is greater than 10. </p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p><em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em> roosts in caves and old underground mine workings in colonies of a few to several thousand individuals. Physiological studies have demonstrated that this species has one of the highest measured rates of pulmocutaneous water loss of any mammal and is unable to enter torpor (Baudinette <em>et al</em>. 2000), and thus it has an obligate requirement for warm, humid roost microclimates that are physiologically benign (Churchill 1991; Armstrong 2001). Deeper caves and mines that have the capacity to support these conditions are relatively uncommon in most rocky northern landscapes, which limits roosting opportunity, area of occupancy, and results in aggregations in relatively few subterranean structures. In the arid Pilbara region, bats will accumulate in the deepest structures during the hottest and driest parts of the year, spreading further afield when wetter conditions provide the opportunity for shallower caves to provide humid microclimates (Armstrong 2001). In the monsoonal north, the humid conditions probably allow more shallow caves to be used, and there have been rare reports of roosting in buildings. A suggestion of tree roosting is often quoted based on the comments of Churchill (1991, 1994), but this has never been confirmed in any population. In the Northern Territory both sexes accumulate into larger colonies to mate, but later in the breeding season many females disappear from known caves, and maternity colonies have not yet been observed in this region. Females give birth to a single young and lactation occurs in the wet season when insect availability is high (Churchill 1994).</p>  <p><em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em> are strong and highly acrobatic fliers, in contrast to many small hipposiderids bats, and forage in the open around vegetation (Bullen and McKenzie 2002), usually within a few metres of the ground (Churchill <em>et al</em>. 1988). They feed on a wide variety of insects, though mainly smaller moths and beetles and occasional seasonal abundances of groups such as isopterans (Churchill 1994). There is a possibility that they feed on accumulations of small insects at cave entrances (Cramer <em>et al.</em> 2016), possibly accounting for their commonly observed night visitation of underground structures that are not used during the day for roosting. They are normally observed foraging in gullies, gorges and larger watercourses, as well as open woodland and over hummock grasslands (Churchill <em>et al</em>. 1988; Armstrong 2001). </p>  <p></p>","<p>This species is well known to be very sensitive to roost intrusions and capture at roost entrances. Individuals will often vacate a roost following a disturbance, and the default assumption is that roost abandonment leads to higher rates of mortality because alternative suboptimal roosts nearby are less likely to provide suitable microclimates. Large numbers have also been killed by inappropriate cave gating in the past. A significant proportion of museum specimens originated as road kill, owing to their relatively low foraging height and curiosity for lights, which indicates that new roads close to roosts have the potential to deplete local colonies. The greatest threat to the species is the loss of roost sites that now serve as strongholds for a large proportion of the known population through the gradual deterioration and flooding of old mines and the possibility of catastrophic losses from sudden collapses (Armstrong 2001; Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014). The growing encroachment of iron ore mining also has the potential to remove roosts and thus area of occupancy in terrains where the species roosts in natural caves. Threats to roosting colonies appear to be of lower risk in the Kimberley and Northern Territory, but there is still the potential for catastrophic loss of large numbers if known important colonies are not managed effectively. While <em>R. aurantia</em> has a generalist diet and appears to use a range of habitats for foraging, widespread degradation of habitat quality around a roost, such as from poor fire management, might reduce colony survivability or place a limit on its size.</p>","<p>The literature contains reports of colonies ranging in size from 20 to 25,000 individuals (Churchill 1991), but the larger numbers have not been verified with a robust counting technique, nor have they been noted in recent years. Large colonies are the exception, with only two currently known, and it is very likely that they number in the low thousands. Based on captures and the non-invasive quantification of activity near roost entrances, typical colony sizes range from a few individuals up to the low hundreds (K.N. Armstrong unpublished data). <em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em> can appear relatively common in a locality because they are relatively simple to detect, either by active searching with a bat detector and taking advantage of their curiosity for small light sources, or by placing unattended bat detectors at cave entrances and relying on encounters following night visitation of non-roost caves. In reality, detections across an area might derive from widely ranging individuals that originate in a one or a few local roosts (K.N. Armstrong unpublished data). Suggestions of widespread commonality have not always been underpinned by effort to locate roost sites and estimate colony sizes (McKenzie and Bullen 2009), and hence there is still a relatively poor understanding of how limiting roost sites are across regions despite widespread records (Armstrong 2001; Cramer <em>et al</em>. 2016). Populations have not been connected across the Great Sandy Desert for many thousands of years (Armstrong 2006; Armstrong and Coles 2007), and movement within regional populations is probably related to the availability of suitable roosts that allow individuals to saltate across otherwise inhospitable landscapes (Armstrong 2001).</p>",Unknown,"This species is endemic to Australia where it is found in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and north-western Queensland (Armstrong 2008; Churchill <em>et al.</em> 2008).",,Terrestrial,"<p>It is considered to be protected and secure in numerous protected areas in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia, Northern Territory and north-western Queensland, though several of the largest colonies are not in protected areas. Further studies are needed into the distribution, roost site locations, abundance, biology, and threats to this species (Cramer et al. 2016). A national conservation plan, incorporating a regional approach to management in the Pilbara region, would assist both mining proponents and government land managers (Armstrong 2001, 2010, 2011), and targeted, collaborative approaches between industry and wildlife managers for active management of stronghold colonies in underground mine workings and caves with colonies of significant size would help reduce the risk of losses from both insidious and catastrophic causes.</p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global
