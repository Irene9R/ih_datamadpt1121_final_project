Feeds in shallow (0.5-1.5 m deep) and warm (more than 24 °C) backwaters, lakes and flooded areas with slow current, feeding mostly on zooplankton and algae. Spawns in very deep, very turbid and warm water, above 18°C (usually 22-30°C), with high current (1.1-1.9 m/s) and high oxygen concentration. Lives up to 20 years. Spawns for the first time at 5-6 years , 550-700 mm SL and 5-10 kg, earlier and smaller in subtropical areas. Migrates long distances upriver at the beginning of a rapid flood and water-level increases (in April-July depending on locality). Spawns during floods in upper water layer or even at water surfaces, but stops spawning if conditions change and starts again with increase of water level. Females spawn up to 1.1 million eggs in 1-3 portions depending on duration of high-water period. Eggs are yellowish, transparent, and hatch after about 2 days at temperatures around 25°C while drifting downstream in the deep open-water layer. If the river flow is blocked or if available river stretches are too short, eggs cannot drift long enough and fail to develop. After spawning, adults leave the river and migrate back to foraging habitats. Larvae drift downstream and settle in floodplain lakes, shallow shores and backwaters with little or no current.

2245386,193598,Takifugu vermicularis,Near Threatened,,2014,2011-06-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"In the Northwest Pacific,&#160;<em>T. vermicularis</em>&#160;is distributed from Japan to the East China Sea. In Japan, in is found in the Inland Sea of Seto and the western coast of Kyushu. In China, the species occurs in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East China Sea. It is found at depths ranging from one to 30 m. It is found in coastal areas, creeks, and estuaries. <em>Takifugu vermicularis</em>&#160;is a highly-prized food fish in Japan with a high retail value. Aggregate landings data for several species of valuable <em>Takifugu</em> from Japan show an increase in landings to a peak in the late 1990s/early 2000s, followed by a roughly 75% decline in landings to 2007. The relative contribution of <em>T. vermicularis</em> to these landings, however, is unknown. Additional population data from the Yellow Sea reveal decreases in mean size and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from 1985 to 2002, which are indications of possible population decline. Possible threats to <em>T. vermicularis</em> include overfishing, habitat modification and possible negative effects of large-scale aquaculture of congeners, which can introduce pathogens to wild populations. Additionally, this species is considered to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation because of its generally larger size, slow growth rate, late maturation and lower potential rates of population increase. As it is taken in the same fisheries, <em>T.&#160;vermicularis&#160;</em>is likely to benefit from conservation measures in place for <em>T. rubripes</em>.&#160;Due to declining stocks, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005. This plan set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. Available information suggests that this species has undergone population declines in parts of its range, however these are currently unquantifiable. The population of <em>T. vermicularis</em>&#160;is likely conservation dependent, its persistence linked to successful fisheries management. Therefore it is assessed as Near Threatened.<br/><em><br/><br/></em>","<em>Takifugu vermicularis</em> is a temperate, demersal species which occurs near shore in semi-enclosed sea areas and and in estuaries (Yamada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1995). It undergoes seasonal migrations (Matsui <em>et al.</em>1987). It has also been collected from creeks in Inchon and Ansan, Korea (Jeon and Yoo 1995).<br/><br/>The lifespan of<em> T. vermicularis</em> is estimated at five years. Growth of this species, in total length, can be related to the growth of the fifth vertebral centrum. The&#160;annual&#160;mark is formed in June. The calculated total length at time was 132 mm in one year, 194 mm in two years, 241 mm in three years, 274 mm in four years, and 299 mm in five years (Matsui <em>et al. </em>1987).&#160;Naturally occurring hybrids of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. vermicularis </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. xanthopterus </span>have been observed from Ariake Bay, Kyushu, Japan (Masuda<em> et al. </em>1991).<br/><br/>The skin and intestine are highly toxic, and the ovaries and liver are extremely toxic. The flesh and testes are believed to be edible although they are slightly toxic, and sometimes highly toxic (Nakabo 2002). In the ovaries, TTX was recognized in the nucleus, yolk vesicles and yolk granules of oocytes (Mahmud<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2003). This species also bio-accumulates saxitoxin, a paralytic shellfish toxin (Nakamura<em> et al. </em>1984). <br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).","<p><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""></span></span></p><p><em>Takifugu vermicularis</em> is considered to be particularly  vulnerable to exploitation  because of its generally larger size, slow  growth rate, late maturation  and lower potential rates of population  increase (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  1990, Jin  and Tang 1996, Xu and Jin 2005). Based on data collected from  bottom trawl surveys  in winter in the southern Yellow Sea, <em>T. vermicularis</em> has shown  decreasing mean individual weight and catch-per-unit effort  from&#160;1985 to 2002 (Xu and Jin 2005). The intrinsic vulnerability of this species is 38 (Cheung&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2008).<br/><br/><strong>Fugu fishery<br/></strong>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated. Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. vermicularis</em> are unknown, landings of this species, along with other desirable <em>Takifugu</em> spp. have declined by 75% from 2000 to 2007 (Kawata 2012).</p><p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations<br/></strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aquacultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/></p>","Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995 and Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Aquaculture efforts focus on&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth&#160;among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em><em>&#160;</em>is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999 (Kikuchi 2006). One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high mortality–survival is estimated to be less than 50% - from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).</p><p>Tiger puffer (<em>T. rubripes</em>) was introduced to China from Japan (Lin and &#160;Huang 2007). To meet increasing demand for pufferfish, China began large-scale artificial breeding of pufferfish in the 1990s. An annual output of about 4,000 tonnes of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, which was introduced from Japan to China (Lin and Huang 2007) is exported to Japan and South Korea. Additionally, an annual output of about 6,000 tonnes of&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>&#160;was also produced for export in China.

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010). Stock enhancement programs exist for  this species in Japan using  hatchery raised fingerlings (Fushimi 2001).  Optimal release locations  have been determined (Nakajima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>   2008), however it has been found that hatchery-reared juveniles were   more easily preyed upon than wild juveniles due to differences in   swimming depth and TTX concentrations (Shimizu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012).

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004).

Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. chinensis</em> are not well understood, over-exploitation was the principal cause of population decline in several congeners, including the closely related <em>T. rubripes</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<strong>Population structure<br/></strong>Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;revealed that the genetic differences between&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. pseudommus</em>,&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>basilevskiannus</em>, and&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<em>&#160;</em>Additionally,<em>&#160;</em><em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. pseudommus&#160;</em>were previously proposed to belong to the same species as&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;based on analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Song&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Reza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;<span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/><strong>Population trends<br/></strong><em>Takifugu chinensis</em>&#160;is among the top four highly-commercial Fugu species in Japan. These include:&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em>,&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. porphyreus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. xanthopterus. </em>Catch records of&#160;<em>T. chinensis&#160;</em>in on the west coast of Kyushu Island, Japan&#160;have shown a sharp drop from 3600 tonnes/year in 1969, to 2300 tonnes/year in 1972, to 1600 tonnes per year in 1975, to 1000 tonnes/year in 1979, to 200 tonnes/year in 1989, and 100 tonnes in 1999 (Yamada <em>et al. </em>2007). More recent records from the National Fisheries University in Shimonoseki City (the city being famous for its specialized pufferfish-only market),&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;was regularly found in the Fugu fish market in the 1960s at a level of 3000 tonnes, however the figure dropped sharply in the late 1970s through the 1990s. Only one tonne was recorded in 2006 and 2008&#160;(Matsuura pers. comm. 2010).&#160;Based on the above landing statistics, it is estimated that the global population of&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;may have declined by over 99.99% over the last 40 years. Over the course of three generation lengths, or 12 years, this species may have declined by as much as 99%. This estimate is based on landing statistics of harvests from the East China Sea and Yellow Sea provided by the Sekai National Fisheries Institute in Nagasaki and the National Fisheries University in Shimonoseki City. It is also worth noting that&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, one of the most expensive commercial fish species in Japan which is a genetically close relative of&#160;<em>T. chinensis&#160;</em>has also experienced population declines in the region which have been attributed to fisheries mismanagement and overfishing. Despite increasing fishing effort in the region, the wild catch of <em>T. rubripes </em>fell to less than 500 tonnes in 1994, and has continued to decrease ever since (Reza <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><p><em>Takifugu chinensis </em>is uncommon in museum collections, it is represented by eight lots (FishNet2 database searched November 2013).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis</span> is found in the Northwest Pacific, from Northern Kyushu, Japan west to the East China and Yellow seas (Nakabo 2002).&#160;It is found at depths ranging from 5 to 150 metres.","<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis </span>is a highly-desirable, commercially important species.

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7800 to 11000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks 5th among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high mortality—survival is estimated to be less than 50%—from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>  <p></p>",Marine,"There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis</span>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. chinensis</em>.<br/><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines.

2247747,193612,Takifugu rubripes,Near Threatened,,2014,2011-06-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is distributed in the northwestern Pacific, in the western part of the sea of Japan and the East China and Yellow seas, northward to Muroran, Hokkaido, Japan. It is found in the Yellow, Bohai, and East China Seas. It is a coastal species which is found at depths ranging from 10 to 135 m. This species is dependent on estuaries for spawning. Juveniles mature in estuaries and migrate offshore to spawn.<em> Takifugu rubripes</em> is a highly prized food fish in Japan with a high retail value. Population declines which have been attributed to the use of highly-effective fishing gear have been recorded in parts of its range, however range-wide information is currently not available. Available landing information from Japan indicates landings have declined to about 5% of their historical peak from 1987 to 2004. Stocks in the Seto Inland Sea have failed to recover from historical declines resulting from excessive fishing effort and a decline in anchovy stocks. Due to declining stocks, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005. This plan set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is aquacultured in large quantities in order to meet consumer demand, however wild-caught <em>T. rubripes</em> remain highly valued. Stock enhancement programs using aquacultured<em> T. rubripes</em> are in place, however the efficacy of these programs is unknown and mortality in aquaculture is high due to parasitic diseases, which may become introduced into wild populations. Genetic diversity is maintained in both wild populations but is decreased in cultured populations, which may reduce the overall fitness of this species. Available information suggests that <em>T. rubripes</em> has undergone significant population declines in parts of its range. As a highly-valued foodfish the persistence of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em> is highly dependent on species-specific regulatory measures including an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, mandated release of small fishes, and aquacultured fish to meet increasing consumer demand. Therefore, it is considered Conservation Dependent and is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened.","<strong>Habitat and depth distribution<br/></strong><em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is a demersal species. Adults are found in inlet waters, occasionally entering brackish waters.  Fingerlings are often seen in brackish river mouths (Kato<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005) and can tolerate salinities ranging from 25%–100% of that of seawater (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2005). Immature <em>T. rubripes</em> are found in the area between the Seto Inland Sea and the Japanese coast, and they move from the open sea prior to becoming adult fish.&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em>&#160;is unable to live deeper than 150 meters and prefers depths of 100 to 135 meters and above on the continental shelf in the western Enshu Nada (Achiha 2006).&#160;Electronic tagging was used to examine the ecology of this species, and revealed a typical diurnal change in swimming depth with seasonal variations. In winter, this species generally occupies the upper 10 m of the water column, and dives to depths reaching 90 m. In autumn the main swimming layer ranged from the surface to the upper 30 m of the water column (Nakajima 2001). This species exhibits burrowing behaviour.<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction and Life History<br/></strong>The age of first maturity has been estimated at two to three years (Yu 2003,&#160;K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Longevity is estimated at nine years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).&#160;The results of tagging experiments indicate that adult <em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea migrate to coastal areas in western Japan to spawn. After spawning, the puffer seems to migrate again to the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, and to the Gulf of Bohai (Tagawa 1996). <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> returns to the same spawning ground and strongly shows homing behaviour to its natal spawning grounds (Nakajima and Akira 2005).&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em> moves offshore with growth and breeds in the sea (Kato<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005) from March to May. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> spawns demersal eggs which hatch in four to ten days (Sato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). Juveniles mature in shallow bays and river mouths for one year, and then migrate permanently to the open ocean (Kato <em>et al.</em> 2010). Juveniles resemble <em>T. niphobles</em> (Masuda <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Generation length calculation</strong><br/>The generation length of <em>T. rubripes</em> has been estimated using the following formula: A<sub>m</sub> + ((A<sub>max</sub> - A<sub>m</sub>)/2), where&#160;A<sub>m </sub>= age at maturity and A<sub>max </sub>= longevity. The estimated generation length of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 5.75 years.<br/><br/><strong>Toxicity<br/></strong>This species bioaccumulates tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Noguchi <em>et al.</em> 2006). The liver and ovaries are highly toxic, the intestines slightly toxic and the  flesh, skin and testes are innocuous (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/><strong><em>Takifugu</em> and Tetraodontidae<br/></strong>As one of the first vertebrates whose genome has been completely sequenced,&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;has become a model organism for genomics studies (Aparicio&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002).&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes&#160;</em>is morphologically similar to&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. pseudommus</span>, and a number of genome-level molecular studies suggest that they are the same species (Cui&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005), differing only in the color of the anal fin.

Several reasons have been given to account for declining populations of targeted Fugu species. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is primarily captured by long-line.&#160;Long-line fishing, which is a particularly effective method of catching this species, has become wide-spread with the advent of modified, low-cost, easy-to-use long-lines. Large numbers of sexually immature Fugu have been caught, and <em>T. rubripes</em> between year one and two, which are reputed to taste better, are most heavily targeted, which has resulted in recruitment overfishing for <em>T. rubripes </em>and other targeted Fugu species<span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""> (Nagai 2003).

The fishing power of individual fisheries targeting&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes</span>&#160;increased substantially when fishing vessel and fishing gear improved, resulting in an excessive fishing effort.

A large quantity of small immature fishes is usually caught in the Seto Inland Sea by various types of fishing gear his often results in growth and/or recruitment overfishing for many species (Nagai 2003).&#160;<br/><p>Since 1984, Japan's fisheries have increasingly relied on coastal fisheries, which target high-value species and may pose a threat to coastal species such as&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. rubripes&#160;</span>(Schmidt 2003).&#160;Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia (Kawata 2012).<br/><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","<strong>Population structure<br/></strong>Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;revealed that the genetic differences between&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. pseudommus</em>,&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>basilevskiannus</em>, and&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species&#160;<em>T.</em><em>&#160;rubripes</em><em></em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<em>Takifugu chinensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. pseudommus&#160;</em>were previously proposed to belong to the same species as&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;based on analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Song&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Reza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Local populations in Nagasaki, Japan, have been identified by IUCN as threatened at the population level due to this over-exploitation. Additionally stocks in the Seto Insland Sea have failed to recover from historical declines resulting from excessive fishing effort and declining anchovy stocks, which formed a key component of this species' diet (Nagai 2003). Several reasons have been given to account for declining populations of targeted Fugu species. <em>T. rubripe</em>s is primarily captured by long-line. Long-line fishing, which is a particularly effective method of catching this species, has become widespread with the advent of modified, low-cost, easy-to-use long lines. Large numbers of sexually immature Fugu have been caught, and <em>T. rubripes</em> between year one and two, which are reputed to taste better, are most heavily targeted, which has resulted in recruitment over-fishing for <em>T. rubripes</em> and other targeted Fugu species (Nagai 2003).&#160;Prior to 1999, the prevalence of foreign fishing vessels in open seas resulted in the capture and discard of large numbers of <em>T. rubripes</em>.<br/><br/>There are population declines in parts of its range from harvesting, however this is not inferred to reach thresholds for a threatened category (K.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> revealed that the genetic differences between  <em>T. </em><em>orbimaculatus</em>, <em>T. </em><em>coronoidus</em>, <em>T.</em> <em>fasciatus</em><em></em>, and <em>T. </em><em>obscurus</em> are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species <em>T.</em><em> coronoidus</em><em></em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue <em>et al.</em> 2009). <span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times, <em>Takifugu</em>  interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization  in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita  1967, Masuda <em>et al.</em> 1991, Miyaki <em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Each&#160;combination of <em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><em><br/>Takifugu coronoidus</em> is a rare species throughout its distribution in China. <em>Takifugu&#160;coronoidus</em>&#160;was not found in a search of available museum collection databases (Accessed through the Fishnet2 Portal, www.fishnet2.org, 2014-06-14).<span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu coronoidus</span> is found off the coast of China in the lower reaches and mouths of rivers such as the Chongming (Shanghai), Shazhou, Haimen and Nantong (Jiangsu), down to southern Guangdong Province (Wu <em>et al.</em> 1999).

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu coronoidus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. coranoidus</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries.

However, because of its affinity with coral reefs and seagrass beds, we  infer that it may be experiencing population declines due to habitat  loss in parts of its range.This little known species is likely threatened by coral reef and seagrass habitat losses. As of 2008, fifteen percent of the world’s coral reefs were considered under imminent threat of being “Effectively Lost” (with 90% of the corals lost and unlikely to recover soon), with regions in East Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the wider Caribbean being the most highly threatened (Wilkinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).

The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu exascurus</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. poecilonotus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999.

As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes.

It is found at depths ranging from zero to 20 metres. This species spawns in shallow coastal waters, and the larvae may be dependent on estuaries for their development.&#160;<em>Takifugu flavidus&#160;</em>is the most highly valued Fugu species in China, and has been the subject of artificial breeding efforts in China for the purposes of stock enhancement and in order to supply fish for human consumption. There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place, however generalized&#160;seasonal fishing prohibitions and the presence of both fresh and marine water preserves in parts of its range may offer this species some protection. There are indications of population decline in this species due to habitat degradation, overfishing and other factors. Historical landings from the Yangtzee River basin show steep declines in landings (95%) from the 1950s to the 1970s, and although recent landing statistics are not available, qualitative assessments by scientists in the region indicate that wild stocks of this species are in a state of decline. It is inferred that this species is dependent on fisheries management, such as off-fishing seasons, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and the increasing aquaculture of fish to meet increasing consumer demand which can not be met by wild stocks alone. Therefore, it is considered Conservation Dependent and is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened.&#160;Further research is needed to better quantify stock decline, and may reveal that this species qualifies for a higher threat category, especially given its high commercial value. Due to the economic importance of the&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>genus, and the prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological methods in addition to habitat and population monitoring.","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span> occurs near shore (Yamada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995) over sandy or muddy bottoms at depths ranging from very shallow waters to 20 metres. Although it does not undergo large migrations (Yang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991), it is known to migrate to coastal areas in the spring and summer to spawn, and then return to deeper waters in the autumn and winter. The larvae may be estuarine-dependent, as they remain in the estuaries and coastal areas for months before entering deeper waters (Zhang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). <em>Takifugu flavidus </em>feeds on molluscs and crustaceans. The ovaries, liver, and intestine are highly toxic. The skin is less toxic. The testes are innocuous, but sometimes toxic (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/>The generation length of <em>T. flavidus</em> is estimated at three to four years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011), based on an estimation of the  natural lifespan of this species of six to seven years, with the  age of first maturity occurring between years one and two. This species is bred in captivity.<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012).

Juveniles occur in nearshore areas (Suda<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2004). During trawls of the shelf and drop-off areas of southwestern  Sakhalin, maximum catches of this species this were recorded at a  temperature of 16–17°C over depths of 115 to 124 metres. In general, the main  aggregation of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. porphyreus</span> was concentrated over the shelf, at depths shallower than 200 meters (Velikanov and Stominok 2006).<br/><br/><em>Takifugu porphyreus</em> bio-accumulates tetrodotoxin (TTX). The highest concentrations are found in the liver and ovaries, with moderate concentrations found in the skin and intestine  (Noguchi<em> et al. </em>2006). The flesh and testes are innocuous (Nakabo 2002). <em>Takifugu porphyreus </em>species has been induced to spawn and the larvae have been reared in a laboratory setting (Fujita and Abe 1992).<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).","<em></em><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><em><br/>Takifugu porphyreus</em> is commercially targeted for the Fugu  trade. Japanese fisheries data from 1979–2007 show fluctuating landing  trends which appear to indicate shifting targets, and marked declines in  recent years. As fewer highly-desirable and notably over-exploited  species were landed (Torafugu <em>T. rubripes</em> and Karasu <em>T. chinensis</em>), landings of <em>T. porphyreus</em>  began to increase in 1990 and continued to increase until 2003 to a peak  of ~380 tonnes after which landings declined to less than 150 tonnes  between 2005 and 2007. The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. </em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">porphyreus</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p><p>  </p>","<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;inter-specific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Japanese fisheries data from 1979–2007 show fluctuating landing  trends which appear to indicate shifting targets, and marked declines in  recent years. As fewer highly-desirable and notably over-exploited  species were landed (Torafugu<em> = </em><em>T. rubripes</em> and Karasu = <em>T. chinensis</em>), landings of <em>T. porphyreus</em>  began to increase in 1990 and continued to increase until 2003 to a peak  of ~380 tonnes, after which landings declined to less than 150 tonnes  between 2005 and 2007 (data from Shimonoseki Chuoh Oroshiuri Shijou, 1979–2007, from figure in Kamata 2012), a decline of roughly 60% over four years. Although the recent sharp decrease in landings of <em>T. porphyreus</em> observed from 2003 to 2007<em> </em>is cause for concern, the window of time over which this decline has occurred is insufficient for the application of criterion A.<br/><br/>Several reasons have been given to account for declining populations of targeted Fugu species. Fugu species are&#160;primarily captured by long-line.This fishing method is highly effective and has become widespread with the advent of modified, low-cost, easy-to-use long lines&#160;(Nagai 2003). The targeting of sexually immature individuals between age one and two has resulted in population declines in the commercially-important<em> T. rubripes.</em> It is&#160;inferred&#160;that juvenile <em>T. porphyreus</em> are likely to also be subject to this fishing preference.<br/><br/><em>Takifugu porphyreus</em> appears to be common off southwestern Sakhalin. The results of a trawl survey indicated that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. porphyreus</span> ranked first in catches by the frequency of occurrence (about 55%) among epipelagic fishes. Catches varied from one to eight individuals per trawl (Velikanov and Stominok 2006). In Japan, <em>T. porphyreus</em> is common and can be locally abundant (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).&#160;<em>Takifugu porphyreus</em> is moderately common in museum collections where it is represented by at least 31 lots (FishNet2 database searched ).",Unknown,"In the Northwest Pacific, <em>T. porphyreus</em> is known from Sakhalin (Velikanov and Stominok 2006),  southern Hokkaido, Japan to the Yellow Sea, East China Sea. It has also been recorded from the northern coast of Taiwan (K.-T. Shao pers. comm. 2014). Its range may extend south to the South China Sea&#160;and in the waters of Hong Kong (Ni and Kwok 1999), however this is generally considered a temperate species known from <span>44°N–<span>35°N.</span>","<em>Takifugu pophyreus</em>, also known as ""Ma-fugu"" in Japan, is commercially targeted for the consumptive pufferfish trade and commands a high price.   In Japan, pufferfish are caught primarily using modified longlines which are attractive to novice fishermen due to their ease of use (Kawata 2012).<br/>    <p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu porphyreus,</em>&#160;however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. porphyreus</em>.</p>    <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>    <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>    <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009), and we support this recommendation.</p> <p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","",,false,false,Global

As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010). Stock enhancement programs exist for  this species in Japan using  hatchery raised fingerlings (Fushimi 2001).  Optimal release locations  have been determined (Nakajima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>   2008), however it has been found that hatchery-reared juveniles were   more easily preyed upon than wild juveniles due to differences in   swimming depth and TTX concentrations (Shimizu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50 m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>         <p><strong>Further Research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is a coastal species which can be found over rocky, sandy, or muddy substrates and in the vicinity of seagrass beds. <em>Takifugu pardalis</em> is incidentally harvested and marketed as a food fish; however, there does not appear to be a targeted fishery for this species. There are no known species-specific threats to<em> T. pardalis</em>, and its distribution overlaps several marine protected areas. It is therefore listed as Least Concern. Due to the economic importance of the <em>Takifugu </em>genus, and the   prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend   further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological   methods.","<em>Takifugu pardalis</em> is a temperate, coastal, demersal species over rocky (Yamada<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>1995), sandy, or muddy bottoms as well as in seagrass beds at depths ranging from very shallow to 20 metres. In the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Zostera marina</span> beds off central Japan, juveniles of this species feed mainly on gammaridean and caprellidean amphipods, while adults feed mainly on hard-shelled animals such as gastropods, bivalves and crabs (Horinouchi and Sano 2000). Individuals of this species were more likely to be found in the sandy microhabitat near seagrass beds, as opposed to in the beds themselves (Horinouchi 2009). The ovaries and liver are extremely toxic, the skin and intestine are highly toxic, the testes are slightly toxic, and the flesh is generally believed to be innocuous. However, some specimens have been found to be toxic (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/>This species spawns demersal eggs. In the Yangtze River estuary, this species is known to spawn from May to June, May to July and April to June (Ruijing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).</p>","<p><em>Takifugu pardalis</em>&#160;may be threatened by coastal habitat degradation and overfishing in parts of its range.&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. xanthopterus</em> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.</p>  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu pardalis</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. chrysops</span> (Yamanoue<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008). Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

It is found at depths ranging from one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifugu pardalis </em>is incidentally caught, but is not targeted by consumptive fisheries. It is called ""Higan-fugu"" in Japan (Nakabo 2002).&#160;<em>Takifugu pardalis</em>, like other Fugu species, is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is very efficient in catching this species (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Despite a ban on the sale of toxic pufferfishes in fish markets, <em>T. pardalis</em> may sometimes found in processed fish products in Taiwan (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><strong><br/>Aquaculture<br/></strong>Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996).

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010). Stock enhancement programs exist for  this species in Japan using  hatchery raised fingerlings (Fushimi 2001).  Optimal release locations  have been determined (Nakajima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>   2008), however it has been found that hatchery-reared juveniles were   more easily preyed upon than wild juveniles due to differences in   swimming depth and TTX concentrations (Shimizu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures.

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are as follows: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger  puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases  (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>  Additionally, the toxic viscera of pufferfish (mainly ovaries and liver) produce tetrodotoxin, which is valued for its many pharmaceutical applications (Yu 2003).",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu alboplumeus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. alboplumbeus</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines.

Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of Takifugu pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. oblongus</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this minor commercial species are impacted by this fishery. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</span><br/> Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia.

As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991).

It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</span><br/> Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967,  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Along the coasts of Pattani and Narathiwat provinces bordering the Gulf of Thailand, samplings were conducted every two months from November 2005 to July 2007 by bottom trawl towing during daylight hours at approximately 2.3 knot for 60 minutes, and only five specimens were collected in a total of 144 hauls (Hajisamae and Yeesin 2010).<br/><br/><em>Takifugu oblongus</em> is common in museum collections, where it was represented by 54 lots (FishNet2 Database searched December 2013).",Decreasing,"In the Indo-West Pacific,<em> T. oblongus</em> is distributed from  South Africa to Indonesia, northward to Japan, southward to Australia. It is found along the coast of the South China Sea, and in the southern part of the east China Sea (Su and Li 2002, Nakabo 2002). It is found at depths of one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifugu oblongus </em>may be a minor component of the Japanese puffer fish trade. It is called ""Taki-fugu"" in Japan. Despite a ban on the sale of toxic pufferfishes in fish markets,&#160;<em>T. oblongus</em> may sometimes found in processed fish products in Taiwan (Huang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/><strong>Aquaculture</strong><br/>There is no evidence that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. oblongus</span> has been artificially cultured. Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China.

About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999.

It is a top predator of hard-shelled prey such as molluscs (Shegemiya 2004).<br/></p><p>Groups nearing 1,000 individuals have been observed to gather off  specific beaches in Japan from late May to early July, annually, to spawn during phases at dusk for several days during spring  tides. Males outnumber females during the spawning season, and <em>T. niphobles </em>will form spawning groups consisting of one ripe female  and several males. As an intertidal spawner, <em>T. niphobles</em> will deposit eggs and  sperm on beaches with rock, pebble, and boulder bottoms. Spawning fish  fling themselves out of the water and fertilization occurs on the beach,  where gametes are then swept back into the sea, or may be incubated  under rocks on the beach, thus enduring periods of exposure to air  (Yamahira 1997, K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). In Hong Kong waters, the annual spawning season of this species is from October to February (Yu and Yu 2002).

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu niphobles</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. alboplumbeus</span> (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).

Between June 1997 and August 1998, about 100 puffer fish specimens were able to be easily collected&#160; from Hong Kong waters every two months for toxicity studies (Yu and Yu 2002). This species is also described as being very common along the coasts of Japan (Honma<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>1980). Between March 2007 and February 2008, fish sampling was conducted  during the spring tide once a month in northwestern Kyushu Island,  Japan. Juveniles of this species were a numerically dominant component  of the surf zones of sandy beaches, representing 13.6% of the total  catch (Inui <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).

In Japan, this species is distributed from 23°–45° N (Masuda 2007). It is found at depths ranging from one to 20 metres.","<em>Takifufu poecilonotus</em> is incidentally harvested for food but is not targeted (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Although it is sometimes marketed as ""Komon-fugu"" in Japan (Noguchi and Arakawa 2008), this species displays a frequent occurrence of considerably high levels  of TTX in its muscle tissue, and its preparation and consumption has  been been cited as a public concern (Kodama <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1984). Despite a ban on the sale of toxic pufferfishes in fish markets,&#160;<em>T. poecilonotus</em> may sometimes found in processed fish products in Taiwan (Huang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<em> Takifugu poecilonotus</em>, like other fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K.

Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (over 50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>  </p><p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu poecilonotus,</em>&#160;however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. poecilonutus</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Fugu Fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines.

The ovaries and liver are highly toxic, the intestine is  slightly toxic, and the flesh, skin and testes are innocuous (Nakabo  2002). This species has also been found to contain a non-toxic  derivative of TTX in its liver, which is thought to be a precursor or  metabolite of TTX (Nagashima <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006).<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).","<span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight"">This species has experienced population declines in parts of its range from harvesting, however,  this is not inferred to reach thresholds for a threatened category.<br/><p><em>Takifugu xanthopterus&#160;</em>may be threatened by coastal habitat degradation and overfishing in parts of its range. </p><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. xanthopterus</span> are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.</p><p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations<br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aquacultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).

The China Seas have  faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic  activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and  Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution  and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are  characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery  areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu  2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be  heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and  the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in  the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been  implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi  2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the  targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and  greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species  were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the  dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous  pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all  ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005).</p></span></span>","<strong>Population structure</strong><br/>Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

This area may increase slightly in the next decade, but is currently not predicted to reach one&#160;km² (using the recommended grid size of 2x2 km for estimating AOO increases the area to 12 km², a figure which is well within the Endangered threshold and very close to the Critically Endangered threshold). The species does not qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion B2 because it is known from more than one location, and is not severely fragmented.<br/></p>  <p>&#160;The three protected areas (QE II Botanic Park, Salina Reserve, and Colliers Wilderness Reserve) support the entire three subpopulations, the largest of which is approximately 319 adults in the Salina Reserve. The subpopulation structure is predicted to remain stable, and the number of breeding age iguanas within the Salina Reserve and Colliers Wilderness Reserve is expected to increase. Future population growth is not likely to be possible beyond a total of approximately 1,000 adults, unless additional protected habitat is secured.</p>","<p>Comparison with other rock iguana species in the region strongly suggests there was once a coastal population of <em>Cyclura lewisi</em>, which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of a perimeter highway. The sparse interior population is believed to have attracted iguanas to agricultural clearances, where, by 1993, the remnant wild population was occupying the intergrade between dry forest/shrubland and traditional fruit farms. The farms provided thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but also brought the iguanas into harmful contact with people.</p>    Like all <em>Cyclura</em>, the Grand Cayman Blue Iguana<em> </em>is an annual breeder, laying one to 22 eggs depending on the female’s age and size. Hatchlings are vulnerable to native snakes (<em>Cubophis caymanus</em>) and naturally have a very high mortality rate. Head-starting young through the first two years increases survival greatly, and is proving an effective medium-term conservation strategy. This is one of the larger rock iguana species, with the biggest males known to exceed 10 kilograms in mass. Breeding begins in the third year, assuming adequate nutrition. The estimated generation length is approximately 26 years. Average longevity is not known, but may be in excess of 50 years. One male, whose final home was at a US zoo, was known to have lived for at least 69 years.","<p>Feral and free-roaming dogs and cats kill adults and juveniles respectively and have been shown to be capable of causing local extinction of other <em>Cyclura</em> species in absence of other threats (e.g., Iverson 1978). Norway Rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) have also been observed to cause severe injury to Grand Cayman Blue Iguana<em> </em>hatchlings and may cause mortality. Cats, rats, and dogs have been observed throughout all areas of remaining Grand Cayman Blue Iguana<em> </em>occurrence. In 2002 dogs were seen in areas that had supported nesting as recently as 1993. Dog attacks have resulted in observed deaths of adult free-roaming iguanas in the QE II Botanic Park. Predation by feral species generally is regarded as one of the major ongoing threats to this iguana.</p>    <p>Habitat conversion is the second-most major threat to the Grand Cayman Blue Iguana. Traditional fruit farms have been converted to grassland for cattle grazing on a large scale over the last two decades. The loss of fruit trees and herbaceous browse, combined with soil compaction, means this conversion has drastically reduced the extent of suitable habitat for the iguanas. Increasingly, land is also being converted for human residential purposes, which brings an increase in rats, cats, and dogs.</p>    <p>Vehicular road access to farms in inland residential subdivisions has brought fast-moving traffic into remnant iguana areas. Deaths of iguanas dispersing out of protected areas and encountering fast-moving vehicles are now documented every year.</p>    <p>Although <em>Cyclura lewisi</em> is protected under local legislation, occasional illegal captures (not involving international trade) do occur.</p>    <p>A large breeding population of alien Common Green Iguana (<em>Iguana iguana</em>) from Central America has become established on Grand Cayman. While no resulting direct threats to native iguanas have become evident, the presence of another iguana species confuses public awareness effort for conservation of <em>Cyclura lewisi</em>. Occasional specimens of the closely related Sister Isles Rock Iguana (<em>Cyclura nubila caymanensis</em>) from Little Cayman have been found free in western Grand Cayman as a result of deliberate or accidental transport of hatchlings on boats and aircraft. No sightings have occurred in eastern Grand Cayman where <em>C. lewisi</em> persists, but there is clearly a potential risk of hybridization.</p>    Despite a historic tradition of consuming the tail meat of iguanas, modern-day Caymanians do not generally eat iguanas. However, an increasing Central American immigrant human population has brought a tradition of consuming <em>Iguana iguana</em> to Cayman, and there is a danger that this practice could be redirected to native species and threaten Grand Cayman Blue Iguanas.","<p>The wild population of Grand Cayman Blue Iguana is currently estimated at 443 adults, based on known number of iguanas released to the wild and with ongoing monitoring. This is a significant increase compared to three generations ago (78 years) when the population may have been of the order of 250 adults. By 2002, that estimate had further reduced to less than 25 adults surviving in the wild (Burton 2002).</p>    <p>The Blue Iguana Recovery Programme (a programme of the National Trust for the Cayman Islands with local and international partners) maintains a captive breeding and head-starting facility that currently houses an additional 175 iguanas (Grant 2009). With ongoing conservation work, we anticipate the wild population will rise to 1,000 iguanas and stabilize within the next three generations. As a long-lived species with an extended reproductive life, <em>Cyclura lewisi</em> is not subject to extreme population fluctuations.</p>  <p>As a direct result of conservation action, plus natural reproduction in protected areas, the population of Grand Cayman Blue Iguana is increasing.</p>",Increasing,"The Grand Cayman Blue Iguana is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, and currently is only found in the districts of North Side and East End. It occurs from 1-6 m above sea level. Formerly believed (from fossil evidence) to have occurred in suitable habitats throughout Grand Cayman, by 2002 this iguana’s distribution had contracted to a four km²<sup></sup> area of occurrence in the east interior. Since then, repatriation of captive-reared and head-started juveniles to protected areas has expanded its extent of occurrence to 15.6 km²<sup></sup> in three subpopulations located in the QE II Botanic Park, the Salina Reserve, and the Colliers Wilderness Reserve (Burton 2011). The area of occupancy within these areas is 0.5 km²<sup></sup>. Significant breeding populations of <em>Cyclura lewisi</em> no longer occur outside these protected areas.",There is no current or recently historic human use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial,"<p>The National Trust for the Cayman Islands owns and protects a substantial network of terrestrial protected areas, but within Grand Cayman suitable protected land for the Grand Cayman Blue Iguana<em> </em>is relatively scarce. The Blue Iguana Recovery Programme is successfully breeding these iguanas<em> </em>in captivity, head-starting them to two years old (along with hatchlings from selected wild-laid nests), and releasing them all into protected areas on Grand Cayman. After initial pilot releases into the QE II Botanic Park, the main release effort has been to the Salina Reserve and the Colliers Wilderness Reserve, both in the east interior of Grand Cayman.</p>    <p>These restored populations have all started breeding in the wild. Long term, the programme seeks to restore a genetically diverse, self-sustaining population of approximately 1,000 adult iguanas. Control of feral predators will be required in perpetuity, and to this end nature tourism activities in the Colliers Wilderness Reserve are being developed to generate the necessary sustainable income.</p>    <p>The Grand Cayman Blue Iguana <span lang=""EN-GB"">is fully protected under local legislation and is effectively kept out of international trade by inclusion in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora <span lang=""EN-GB"">(CITES).</span></p>    Grand Cayman Blue Iguanas today are recognized as a significant nature tourism attraction for Grand Cayman. Although the population was restored for conservation reasons, it now constitutes one of the main visitor attractions to the QE II Botanic Park.

In 1992 it was reported as virtually extinct in the wild (Thorbjarnarson 1992) and in 1996 was accorded the IUCN Red List status of ‘Critically Endangered' (Baillie and Groombridge 1996). This status remains unchanged. Field surveys, nearly all conducted since 2000, have confirmed that extant populations persist, but that all are severely diminished and fragmented. Over the past decade new information on the ecology of the species has been documented, although <em>C. siamensis</em> remains one of the least known crocodilians. Commercial hunting for the skin trade and collection of live animals to stock crocodile farms, in the mid- and late-twentieth century respectively, are considered to be the principal causes for its decline. Current threats include illegal collection of eggs, juveniles and adults, habitat loss, incidental capture with fishing gear, and the inherent vulnerability of remnant populations due to their small size.</p>  This species qualifies as Critically Endangered. Global populations have been severely reduced, almost certainly by over 80% in the past 75 years / three generations (assuming a generation time of 25 years), principally due to hunting. All remnant subpopulations are small and fragmented. Most current threats, including illegal collection and habitat loss or degradation, are ongoing, suggesting that without conservation interventions, extant populations will continue to decline.","<em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> occurs in a wide range of lowland freshwater habitats, including slow-moving rivers and streams, lakes, seasonal oxbow lakes, marshes and swamps (Smith 1931; Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003; Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2006; Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). During the wet season, individuals disperse across ﬂooded landscapes (one radio-tracked individual in Cambodia moved up to 25 km before returning to a dry season site; Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006b). The species has been recorded up to 600 m elevation (Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><p> <br/> <em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> is a medium-sized species, with most individuals attaining a total length of less than 3.5 m (Smith 1919). Nesting ecology is poorly documented and fewer than a few dozen wild nests have been located to date. Wild nests recorded in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Thailand were mounds located on floating vegetation mats or on the banks of lakes or rivers (Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Starr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Nesting occurs in the late dry season and and wet season. Clutch size observed in wild nests ranged from 11-26 eggs (Simpson and Han 2004, Starr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Captive <em>C. siamensis</em> produce clutches of 6-50 eggs (Youngprapakorn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1971, Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). Hatchlings emerge in the wet season after 70-80 days incubation (Brazaitis and Watanbe 1983, Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011, Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Fidelity to nesting sites has been recorded (Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a).<br/> <br/> Similar to many other crocodilians, <em>C. siamensis</em> feeds on a wide variety of prey such as invertebrates, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals, including carrion (Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Bezuijen 2010). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Other scientific studies of <em>C. siamensis </em>have included information on phylogeography and population genetics (Gratten 2003), seasonal sperm cycles (Kitiyanant <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994) and the antimicrobial properties of its blood (Merchant <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Hybridization of captive <em>C. siamensis</em> with <em>C. rhombifer</em> and<em>&#160;C. porosus</em> occurs (Chavananikul <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Thang 1994), and the chromosome number of <em>C. siamensis</em> and hybrids, as well as DNA methods to distinguish them, has been identiﬁed (Youngprapakorn 1991, Fitzsimmons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Srikulnath <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012).</p>  ..","<p>Commercial hunting in the mid-twentieth century for the skin trade is considered to be the principal cause for the historical decline of <em>C. siamensis</em>. Current and ongoing threats in virtually all range states include the illegal collection of eggs and crocodiles, habitat loss and degradation, and incidental capture/drowning in ﬁshing gear. In Cambodia, most river systems with extant <em>C. siamensis </em>are targeted for large-scale hydroelectric dams. Construction of some of these dams has already begun and has resulted in the loss of breeding habitat and increased collection and killing of crocodiles (J.C. Daltry unpubl. data). Illegal capture of wild crocodiles to supply local crocodile farms continues in Cambodia. In Viet Nam, over 19 crocodiles were apparently poached at Cat Tien National Park between 2001 and 2012, mainly for local consumption (Murphy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Pahl 2012). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Potential threats in some or all range states include climate change, the potential hybridization of wild populations due to inter-breeding with escaped hybrids, and the risk of genetic depression due to severely low numbers (Jelden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, 2008; Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Viet Nam appears to be the first range state where wild <em>C. siamensis</em> has been extirpated; in 2006, the last known site to support wild <em>C. siamensis </em>(Ha Lam Lake in Phu Yen Province; Nguyen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005) was flooded for construction of a hydroelectric dam. At Mesangat Lake in Indonesia, key threats to <em>C. siamensis </em>are the incidental capture of crocodiles in fishing gear and disturbance due to electro-fishing activities (N. Behler unpubl. data).</p>","<p>No global population estimate is available for <em>C. siamensis</em> and national population estimates are available for only one range state, Cambodia. Between 100 and 300 wild adults may remain in Cambodia, based on footprints and other evidence (Simpson and Han 2006a, Simpson and Bezuijen 2010 and references therein). Lao PDR may support a similar number of adults (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). The largest known population at any single site is 55-60 individuals, in Cambodia (Starr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010), but in both nations most known sites support only one or several individuals. In Thailand, one to several individuals persist in a small number of scattered localities, and nests are sometimes documented (Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, J. Thorbjarnarson in litt. cited in Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). In Viet Nam, the species may have been extirpated from the wild but a reintroduced population based on 60 individuals released between 2001-2004&#160; at Cat  Tien National   Park had an estimated population of 100-150 individuals in 2010-2011. A maximum of 80 non-hatchlings was observed and 10-15 adults estimated&#160; (Pahl 2012). At Mesangat Lake in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, mark-recapture surveys in 2010-2011 indicated that fewer than 30 individuals may be present, although nearby areas remain unsurveyed (N. Behler unpubl. data).</p>    <p>Wild nests and successful recruitment (i.e. presence of hatchlings) have been documented in all range states, but in low numbers. In Cambodia, nesting has been recorded at 10 localities in eight provinces since 2001, but the number of nest sites is declining and only one to three nests are documented annually (Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a). Veal Veng Marsh and the Areng River, both in the Cardamom Mountains, hold the largest wild populations, and each produces one to three nests annually (J.C. Daltry unpubl. data). In Lao PDR, nesting has been documented at eight localities but successful recruitment was confirmed at only five sites (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press). Of four clutches examined in Lao PDR, three were infertile (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press), indicating low female fertility and/or the absence of males. In Thailand, fewer than five wild nests and few hatchlings have been recorded over the past five years, suggesting low clutch fertility (J. Thorbjarnarson in litt. cited by Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press; Y. Temsiripong unpubl. data). In Viet Nam, hatchlings observed at Cat  Tien National   Park in 2010-2011 confirm that breeding persists there (Pahl 2012). At Lake  Mesangat in Indonesia, juvenile crocodiles have been observed and one nest has been located (N. Behler unpubl. data).</p>  <p>On the basis of these limited data, the global wild population of <em>C. siamensis</em> may comprise fewer than 1,000 mature individuals.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Crocodylus siamensis</em> historically occurred over much of mainland Southeast Asia as well as parts of Indonesia. Its current distribution is greatly diminished and fragmented. Extant populations are in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam, wild populations are possibly extirpated, the first range nation where this has occurred, although a reintroduction programme has been implemented in one site (see below). Most locations occur between 50 and 200 m elevation but localities in Cambodia&#160; at Veal Ven Marsh (560 m; Daltry <em>et al</em>. 2003) and the upper Tatai River (730 m; B. Simpson pers. comm.) are higher. Summaries of national distribution are as follows.<br/> <br/> Cambodia: Field surveys conducted since 2000; confirmed <em>C. siamensis </em>localities are from 35 sites in 21 river systems of 11 provinces, mainly in remote parts of southwest and northeast Cambodia (Daltry and Chheang 2000; Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003; Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, 2006; Simpson and Han 2004; Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a; Timmins 2007; Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).

There are no known records from Sarawak or Sabah (Sebastian 1993). There is no other information to suggest that <em>C. siamensis </em>occurred in Malaysia.<br/> <br/> Myanmar: One record of crocodiles and eggs, from the Mekong River (Garnier 1885 - see Garnier 1996); no other known records, although most wetlands in Myanmar remain unsurveyed for crocodiles (Thorbjarnarson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). The section of the Mekong in Myanmar (~200 km long) is currently under restricted access and off-limits to international surveys. Google satellite imagery indicates that much of it retains riverine forest and low human densities: it is possible that some crocodiles may persist (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press).<br/> <br/> Thailand: Historically common and widely distributed (Smith 1919, Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002); extant populations are in a small number of scattered localities in central and western Thailand (Kreetiyutanont 1993, Ratanakorn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Platt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Temsiripong 2003).

In 2010,  Thailand alone reported exports of 106,039 “heads” (see Getpech 2011).   However, the captive population in Indochina includes an unknown number of individuals hybridized with <em>C. porosus</em> and <em>C. rhombifer</em>, including back-crosses (Chavananikul <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Thang 1994, FitzSimmons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Jelden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).

This programme has achieved the monitoring and protection of breeding sites, training of ranger patrols, and community-based conservation initiatives (Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Simpson and Ratanapich 2007, Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a). Veal Veng Marsh, the Areng River, and the Sre Ambel/ Kampong Saom River are the focus of enforcement patrols and community-based conservation management, which have demonstrated success in&#160;reducing poaching since 2001 (Daltry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Simpson and Ratanapich 2007, Simpson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Oum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Additional community sanctuaries are planned in northeast Cambodia and a national re-introduction program will be launched in 2012 (Daltry and Starr 2010, Siamese Crocodile Task Force in prep.).</p>    <p>Elsewhere, status surveys were conducted in Lao PDR between 2003 and 2008, conservation priorities were identified (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in press) and a management plan to protect breeding sites was prepared for one province (Cox and Somvongsa 2008). Community workshops were held in 2006 and 2007 to document local knowledge of crocodiles (Bezuijen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Mollot <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Most <em>C. siamensis </em>localities in Lao PDR are outside the national protected area system and conservation will rely on community-based approaches. In Thailand, a re-introduction programme was initiated by the Royal Thai Forest Service and Crocodile Management Association of Thailand, with 20 crocodiles released in Pang Sida National Park in 2005 and 2006 (Temsiripong 2001, 2007). Few crocodiles were detected during subsequent monitoring (Temsiripong 2007) and further releases are being considered. Severe flooding in Thailand in 2011 hindered the implementation of some re-introduction plans (Y. Temsiripong pers. obs.). In Viet Nam, 60 captive individuals were released in Cat Tien National Park between 2001 and 2004 (Polet 2006) and the population has been irregularly monitored since then. The most recent surveys (2010-2011) confirmed that the population has increased in size, but that crocodiles continue to be hunted by local residents (Pahl 2012). In Indonesia, Mesangat Lake is owned by an oil palm company, and in 2010 the company entered into a partnership with a local foundation, Yayasan Ulin, to jointly manage habitats at the lake (R. Stuebing in litt.).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The large captive populations of <em>C. siamensis </em>held on farms (see Use and Trade) represent a potential source for re-introduction programs, and farms in Thailand and Viet Nam have donated <em>C. siamensis</em> for this purpose.

Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 1,932,680 km<sup>2</sup>. Introduced distribution includes every continent except Antarctica, where it has established in at least 69 countries outside of its native range. Adaptability to a broad range of abiotic and biotic conditions, a generalist life history, and high reproductive rates allow <em>P. reticulata</em> to persist in highly degraded habitat. There is currently no evidence of major range-wide population decline. Therefore, <em>P. reticulata</em> is assessed as Least Concern.</p>","<p>This species occurs in a broad range of freshwater habitats from small, fragmented headwater streams to deep lowland pools, and exhibits a marked degree of population differentiation in morphology, life-history characteristics, and behavior subject to environmental variables (Fajen and Breden 1992). Age at first reproduction in females ranges from 78-91 days, with females maturing earlier in high-predation environments (Reznick&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Reproductive lifespan (age at first maturity to age of senescence) ranges from 462-800 days, depending on predation and environmental parameters (Reznick&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Females produce 15-28 broods over the period of their reproductive life, and exhibit interbrood periods from 25-31 days (Reznick&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).</p>","<p>Local and regional threats to aquatic habitat associated with a broad range of anthropogenic activities continue to impact wetland ecosystems across the globe (Gardner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). However, <em>P. reticulata</em> persists in highly degraded habitat, displays generalist characteristics, adapts to a broad range of abiotic parameters, and exhibits reproductive ecology that favours rapid colonization (Deacon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Deacon and Magurran 2016). Therefore, existing threats are unlikely to elevate the extinction risk of this species.</p>  <p>Genetic analysis on <em>P. reticulata</em> populations throughout the island of Trinidad suggests that despite relatively low effective population sizes in headwater streams, the long-term persistence of populations at these localities does not appear to be jeopardized by population bottlenecking (Barson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Similarly, lowland populations are characterized by high levels of diversity associated with ongoing migration within and among rivers and do not appear to be jeopardized by population bottlenecking (Barson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).&#160;</p><p>In Trinidad, undocumented release associated with in-situ experimental study and the release of experimental fishes may pose a substantial threat to local genetic integrity and provide a vector for disease introduction (Magurran 2005). subpopulations in low predation environments are of considerable scientific value, and may be overharvested at times for scientific research (Magurran 2005). Such is the case regarding the subpopulation sometimes referred to as&#160;<em>P. obscura</em>. In 1957, approximately 200 specimens of<em>&#160;P. reticulata</em>&#160;sourced from the lower Guanapo River (Caroni River drainage) were released into the upper Turure River (Oropuche River drainage) above a barrier waterfall to investigate the influence of predation regime on guppy life history and morphology (Sievers 2011). Subsequent genetic analysis provided evidence for establishment of&#160;<em>P. reticulata</em>&#160;in the Turure River, and a range expansion of the original introduction in a downstream direction and into the middle portion of the river (Sievers 2011). It is important to determine if and to what extent individuals of both populations mix and how offspring contribute to further gene mixing (Sievers&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2011).</p><br/><p></p>","<p>The total population size of this species is unknown. However, it is ubiquitous and highly abundant throughout much of its native distribution (Barson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Population trend is suspected to be stable in the absence of major documented decline.</p>",Stable,"<p></p><p><em>Poecilia reticulata</em> is naturally distributed within parts of northeastern South America and the Lesser Antilles, including Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago, and possibly Guyana (Lucinda 2003, Rodríguez-Olarte&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Range extent into Suriname, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda (Fajen and Breden 1992, Mol&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) may represent naturalized subpopulations (A. Deacon pers. comm. 2020). Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 1,932,680 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records within the known native range of this species (Deacon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, GBIF 2020).</p>  <p>This species has been widely introduced intentionally and unintentionally into other parts of the world as a vector control for mosquito-born disease, and through aquarium release (Deacon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). It is now established in at least 69 countries outside of its native range and continues to negatively impact native fauna throughout its introduced range (Lindholm&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Raghavan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Deacon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Barroso de Magalhães and Jacobi 2013). </p><em>Poecilia obscura</em>, recently described as a distinct species but recognized here as a potentially genetically unique intraspecific lineage,&#160;is restricted to the northern Oropuche drainage on the Island of Trinidad (Phillip&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013, Nanda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). The type locality is the Oropuche River on the road to Cumaca Caves (Schories&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). Additional collections have been taken in the Oropuche headwaters, in the Seco River at the junction with the Salybia River, below Hollis Reservoir, in the Matura River tributary approximately one km north of the road from Sangre Grande to Matura, and at L’Ebranche tributary 3 km south of the upper Manzanilla on the road to Plum Milan (Schories <em>et al</em>. 2009).","<p><em>Poecilia reticulata</em> is widely available in the ornamental aquarium trade.

3150871,97246272,Gopherus agassizii,Critically Endangered,A2abce+4abce,2021,2020-10-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"A provisional Red List Assessment of the widespread Desert Tortoise,&#160;<em>Gopherus agassizii</em> (<em>sensu lato</em>), was performed at a Desert Tortoise Council workshop in 2010 and updated by the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group (TFTSG) in 2011, at which time the Mojave Desert subpopulation, now considered&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu stricto</em>) following taxonomic analysis and splitting into three separate species (<em>G. agassizii, G. morafkai, </em>and<em> G. evgoodei</em>), was assessed as Critically Endangered A2bce+A4bce based on population reduction (decreasing density), habit loss of over 80% over three generations (90 years), including past reductions and predicted future declines, as well as the effects of disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis). <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>) comprises tortoises in the most well-studied 30% of the larger range; this portion of the original range has seen the most human impacts and is where the largest past population losses had been documented.&#160;A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of <em>G. agassizii</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>) has demonstrated continued adult population and density declines of about 90% over three generations (two in the past and one ongoing) in four of the five <em>G. agassizii</em> recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units. As such, we reaffirm the prior assessment of the taxonomically restricted Mojave Desert Tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, as Critically Endangered, and add criterion “a” for direct population observations: CR A2abce+A4abce. The previously defined widespread species&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu lato</em>)&#160;was last assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1996; a separate assessment currently in progress by the TFTSG for the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai </em>(previously considered part of <em>G. agassizii</em>)&#160;has provisionally assessed that species as Vulnerable.","The life history of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is typical of long-lived chelonians and has been reviewed by Berry and Murphy (2019). Tortoises require 17–20 years to reach sexual maturity at a straight-line carapace length (CL) of 18 cm or more (Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, Medica <em>et al</em>. 2012). Variation in years is dependent on desert region, frequency of droughts, and quality of available forage. In the northern part of the geographic range, females smaller than 20.9 cm were not reproducing (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998).&#160; Maximum lifespan was estimated by Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) at 75 years, but few live beyond 50 yrs in the wild (Germano 1992). Generation time was estimated to be 20–32 years (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, USFWS 1994). Based on data from three desert regions, mean sizes of females ranges from 21.4 to 23.1 cm, whereas the mean sizes of males ranged from 24.3 to 24.9 cm; the largest desert tortoises on record, a male, reached 38.1 cm carapace length (Stebbins 2003), whereas a female was 37.4 cm, but these animals were exceptions (Berry and Murphy 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Mature females may lay clutches of one to 10 eggs in up to three clutches per year in spring and early summer; in some years, some females do not lay eggs (Rostal <em>et al</em>. 1994, Henen 1997, Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wallis <em>et al</em>. 1999, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual fecundity ranges from 0 to 16 eggs (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2015). Several factors may affect egg production: site, year, size of female, size and number of eggs, and available water and protein from precipitation and forage in the year preceding egg laying, as well as the year eggs are laid (Henen 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Incubation times for eggs range from 67 to 104 days (Burge 1977, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hatching success varies and appears to depend on year, location of the nest, and whether it is the first or second clutch. Eggs may be infertile or broken during laying (e.g., 12%; Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). Many nests are destroyed by predators before hatching and the loss of eggs (and nests) varies by year (Turner et al. 1987); they estimated an average loss of 37.1% of nests in a multi-year study. Hatching success in intact nests, undisturbed by predators, has been shown to vary from 73 to 100% (McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Rostal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bjurlin and Bissonette 2004, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises inhabit desert scrub habitats, including saltbush, creosote bush, Joshua Trees and Mojave yuccas, and microphyll woodlands with ironwood, palo verde, desert willow, and smoke trees (Berry and Murphy 2019). In the northeastern part of their geographic range, they occur in an ecotone between the Mojave and Great Basin deserts with sand sagebrush and junipers. Actual occurrences tend to be in valleys, alluvial fans, bajadas, and ephemeral stream channels, although tortoises can be found in low sand dunes and on steep slopes of mesas and cliffs (Berry and Murphy 2019).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises are herbivorous and selective in their choice of plant species (Jennings 1993, Oftedal 2002, Oftedal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jennings and Berry 2015). They primarily eat forbs when available. In years of abundant precipitation, they are selective feeders and prefer specific species of annuals and herbaceous perennials in the legume, mallow, borage, aster, four o’clock, and cactus families (as well as other families). Although they eat grasses, a diet solely of grasses is deficient in nutrients and is likely to inhibit growth and survival, especially in neonate, juveniles, and immature tortoises (Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The quality and quantity of preferred plant foods has diminished because of continuing invasion of non-native annual grasses and forbs and increased fire associated with the highly combustible&#160;non-native grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).&#160;<br/><br/>Annual survival and mortality of adults is dependent on sex, size of the tortoise, frequency and severity of droughts, numbers and types of anthropogenic uses, location, and decade of study. In a multi-year study in the eastern Mojave Desert, annual survivorship of juveniles increased with size, ranging from 0.767 when &lt;6.0 cm to 0.861 when 6.0 to 17.9 cm (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). When tortoises reach breeding age at an estimated 18.0 cm, survival rates were 0.87 to 0.944. Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported an annual survival of 0.883 for adults at Joshua Tree National Park. In a study in the Colorado Desert, Agha <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated adult survival at a wind-turbine energy site (0.96) and an adjacent area (0.92). At two sites in the eastern Mojave Desert, Longshore <em>et al</em>. (2003) reported annual survival of adults of 0.985 and 0.829, with the lower survival rate at a site affected by drought.<br/><br/>Woodbury and Hardy (1948) estimated that 1% of adults died per year in a population mostly comprised of adults. In the northeastern Mojave Desert, Turner <em>et al</em>. (1984) reported mortality rates of 18.4% in a year of drought and 4.4% in a normal year. In the western Mojave Desert, death rates were lowest at a protected Research Natural Area (2.8%/yr) and highest in critical habitat (20.4%/yr). At Joshua Tree National Park, the mortality rate was 11.7% (Freilich <em>et al.</em> 2000), and in Red Rock State Park, 67% (Berry et al. 2008). In a demographic study of tortoises at 21 sites in the central Mojave Desert, mortality rates of adults ranged from 1.9 to 95.2% (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) predicted an annual rate of population increase of <em>ca</em>. 2% in a model based on a tortoise subpopulation in the eastern Mojave Desert between 1977 and 1985. By 2000, this subpopulation had declined precipitously, apparently due to disease (see Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2002) estimated the recruitment rate of young tortoises into the adult subpopulation at 0.092 in a plot in Joshua Tree National Park. This number of tortoises on this plot was thought to be stable between 1991 and 1995, but later declined (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>&#160;faces&#160;multiple threats to individuals, populations, and habitat (for annotated bibliographies of reports and published papers, see Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980; Berry 1984; USFWS 1990, 1994, 2010, 2011; Grover and DeFalco 1995; Bury and Luckenbach 2002; von Senckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002; Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2011; Lovich and Ennen 2013a; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015; Berry and Murphy 2019). Recent articles document further examples of threats (Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b,c). Much of the information with numerous references are contained in Berry and Murphy (2019). Substantial tortoise habitat was already lost to cities, towns, settlements, agriculture, energy developments, and military bases in the 20th century, and continuing habitat loss and degradation, combined with high mortality rates in dwindling low-density populations due to disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis), road and off-road vehicle-induced mortality, subsidized predators (e.g., ravens), poaching for pets, and mortality from increasing droughts associated with climate change, are threatening most remaining populations of Desert Tortoises (summarized in Berry and Murphy 2019). The majority of desert tortoise populations are currently considered non-viable because of the low density of adults and their existence in isolated and fragmented pieces of habitat (Berry 1984, USFWS 2010, Allison and McLuckie 2018, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).&#160;<br/><br/>Many threats are cumulative in nature and interact synergistically with others. By rating them separately in the Standard Threats Classification Scheme below, the severity of threats and their negative impacts are not described in full measure. One of the limitations of the classification scheme for threats are the ratings for severity. Severity is associated with declines (or not) by percent over 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer. For species such as desert tortoises with long generation times (<em>ca</em>. 20–30 years), this may be 60 to 90 or more years. Here we provide a detailed and expanded Threats Classification Scheme for <em>G. agassizii</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Detailed Threats Classification Scheme<br/><br/></strong>Classification Level<br/><br/>&#160; a. Examples<br/>&#160; b. Timing and Scope<br/><br/>1.1 Housing &amp; urban areas, towns, settlements, ranches<br/>&#160; a. Desert cities, towns, settlements, scattered homes in rural areas, desert land entry, e.g., Inyokern, Ridgecrest, Red Mountain, Trona, Boron, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, Lucerne Valley, Ft. Irwin, Barstow, Daggett, Mountain Pass, Joshua Tree, Twentynine Palms, Vidal Junction, Ludlow, Amboy, Needles, Las Vegas, St. George, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, Parker, Blythe, El Centro,&#160;Stateline, Las Vegas, Mesquite, St. George.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, disappearance of tortoises and habitat; 20% of geographic range. Loss of habitat from widespread and rapidly growing and expanding cities, towns, and settlements associated with high levels of human population growth in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts and loss and degradation of adjacent habitat (Hughson 2009, U.S. Census Bureau 2010). In the northwest and southwest portions of the geographic range, tortoise populations are locally extinct, absent from valleys and fans and in low densities on military bases.<br/><br/>1.2 Commercial &amp; Industrial<br/>&#160; a. Airports and landing strips, military bases, solar and wind farms.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, loss of tortoises and habitat; 8% of geographic range. Development and use of multiple airports, landing strips, several large military bases with ground disturbing activities (military manoeuvres), and solar and wind farms (with associated transmission lines and roads)&#160;result in degradation and loss of substantial habitat in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts.<br/><br/>1.3 Residential &amp; commercial; golf courses, tourism, recreation<br/>&#160; a. Golf courses are associated with cities and towns that currently exist or are expanding within or near Desert Tortoise habitat (e.g., Las Vegas, Henderson). Vehicle-oriented recreation and visitation are very high in many parts of both deserts including what is now critical habitat, several State Parks and National Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, museums, and other points of interest.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Loss and degradation of habitat, illegal collecting of tortoises: 30%. The high levels of visitor use pose severe threats to <em>G. agassizii</em> throughout remaining habitat as well as in critical habitat. For example, at Lake Mead National Recreation, annual records of visitors from 1946 was &gt;1 million visitors per year; by 2018 more than 7.5 million visits occurred (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/"" style=""color: purple;"">https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/</a>). In parts of critical habitat in the western Mojave Desert, visitor use is very high, e.g., visits and visitor days recorded annually from 2008–2018 ranged from 55,874 to 94,474 visits and 26,218 to 90,445 visitor days per year (USBLM 2019). Visitor use, particularly vehicle-oriented use, is very difficult to control; a substantial portion occurs off-highway and designated trails.&#160;Off-road vehicle recreational uses are associated with higher rates of deaths from gunshots in tortoises occurring in areas with high visitor use days (Berry 1986, 2020a).<br/><br/>2.1.3 Agriculture: Agro-industry farming<br/>&#160; a. Farms for cotton, alfalfa, pistachio, goat-nut, and other crops and dry farming in parts of the geographic range (e.g., Fremont, Antelope, Indian Wells, Victor, Apple, Lucerne, Mojave River, Chuckwalla and Virgin River valleys, bordering the Colorado River).<br/>&#160; b. Severe, cleared land, local areas, often expansive, throughout the geographic range. Historic and ongoing. Habitat and tortoises lost, 10%. Farming began very early (late 1800s) and continues to the present. Farming has negatively affected the water table locally, causing subsidence and fissures to develop in at least one area (Berry 1984), as well as altering vegetation in the vicinity. Habitat cleared for farming generally is used for industrial purposes, e.g., solar or off-road vehicle recreation after abandonment. Both agricultural and industrial uses are associated with influx and proliferation of non-native plants onto adjacent, high quality desert tortoise habitat and protected areas.<br/><br/>2.3.2 and 2.3.3 Agriculture: livestock farming &amp; ranching<br/>&#160; a. Cattle ranching, sheep grazing and driveways, allotments, licenses, and leases (often on federal lands); growing herds of feral burros and expansion into critical habitat.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Moderate to severe, historic (from 1850s), ongoing; 80% of the geographic range affected. Grazing of livestock and use of driveways was widespread and often intensive throughout the geographic range until the Taylor Grazing Act in 1932. Livestock grazing was widespread after that time but managed as an important desert use (e.g., Berry 1984, USBLM 1980). In 1990, after the tortoise was listed as threatened, sheep grazing continued but was excluded from critical habitat. Cattle grazing continued throughout much of critical habitat and still occurs in an estimated 17% of critical habitat (USFWS 2010). Feral burros also graze in tortoise habitats and are encroaching into one critical habitat (USFWS 2010; Berry et al. 2020c). Livestock cause degradation and loss of habitat through development of piospheres, trampling, altering cover, composition of shrubs and forage plants available for tortoises to eat (Webb and Stielstra 1979, Fleischner 1994, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Abella 2008, Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016). The disturbances created by grazing contributes to growth and proliferation of non-native, fire-prone, invasive grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992).<br/><br/>3.1 Energy production &amp; mining: oil and gas<br/>&#160; a. Oil and gas, drilling and exploration.<br/>&#160; b. Medium severity, local areas, &lt;1% of geographic range. Exploratory drilling has occurred in tortoise habitat and has left degraded and cleared areas of &lt; 1-2 ha, with spoil piles, drilling waste, and trash from the drilling operations spread over the area. These sites became focal points for camping and vehicle-oriented recreation, enlarging over time (K.H. Berry pers. obs.).<br/><br/>3.2 Energy production &amp; mining: mining and quarrying<br/>&#160; a. Small and large mines, exploratory pits, bulldozed areas, shafts, and major mines; quarries.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation on a local or regional scale; 5%. Mining on small and large scales began in the late 1800s, killing tortoises and destroying habitat. Roads were constructed to access potential mining areas and districts (Mojave,&#160;Rand, Atolia, Goldstone, Calico, Mountain Pass). Tortoises fall into pits and shafts and were killed. Some mines cover 7.8 km<sup>2</sup> or more and their influence can expand beyond that. Gold mines are associated with spread of mercury and arsenic in soils and plants far beyond the source (e.g., &gt;12 km), transported by wind and water (Chaffee&#160;and Berry 2006; Kim <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014). Tortoises are negatively affected by these elemental toxicants with poor health; these toxicants were reported in livers, integument, lungs, etc.&#160;(Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, Selzer and Berry 2005, Foster <em>et a</em>l. 2009).<br/><br/>3.3 Energy production &amp; mining: renewable energy<br/>&#160; a. Windfarms, photovoltaic, solar fields; new utility and transmission lines, power poles and towers with adjacent roads accompany these developments.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, future. Severe degradation and loss locally over large areas, 5% over the geographic range. Windfarms occur in tortoise habitat, generally on slopes or on hills and small mountains. Solar panels have been constructed on abandoned agricultural fields or in low density or marginal habitat. However, some projects were built in prime habitat, causing loss of habitat and displacement of tortoises. Solar and wind energy is a growing industry with losses of &gt;106 km<sup>2 </sup>as of 2019 (Mark Massar, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>4.1 Transportation and service corridors: roads &amp; railroads<br/>&#160; a. Freeways, 2-lane highways, county gravel or dirt roads, and roads to points of interest; railroads (two major) and several spurs with associated dirt roads and tower lay-down areas for power towers and poles.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe loss and degradation of habitat. 5% throughout the geographic range. Roads were developed in the late 1800s and have proliferated and widened into freeways since that time. Several major freeways and state highways cross the geographic range. Importantly many more dirt roads exist to points of interest (e.g., mines, mining areas, water troughs and water sources, outlying rural areas, recreation areas). Tortoise populations are depleted on either side of highways and well-used roads for distances of &gt;4,000 m (von Seckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002). A very small portion of these roads and highways have tortoise-proof fencing.<br/><br/>4.2 Transportation &amp; service corridors: utility &amp; service lines<br/>&#160; a. Telephone and electric poles and lines; major transmission lines and corridors.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, moderate to severe. Telephone poles and electric poles and lines usually parallel major or minor paved and dirt roads and extend from towns and cities&#160;into remote areas to provide service to agricultural developments, mines, wind and solar farms and individual residences or small settlements. Electric transmission lines cross many parts of the geographic range, including critical habitat (critical habitat alone: 1,634 km of lines in corridors, total area of corridors, 1,743.5 km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2010).&#160; These corridors are accompanied by dirt roads and spurs to the towers. Often corridors contain several sets of towers and electrical lines. Utility lines also include ground disturbance from fibre optic cables, aqueducts, and gas lines, all of which disturb tortoise habitat. Utility poles and transmission lines have allowed for spread of predators (Common Raven, Red-tailed Hawk) into remote parts of the desert, because they make use of the towers and poles for perching and nesting, leading to increased predation on tortoises (Knight and Kawashima 1993, Anderson and Berry 2019).<br/><br/>4.4 Transportation and service corridors: flight paths or military use<p>&#160; a. Commercial, non-commercial, and Department of Defence flight paths.<br/>&#160; b. Numerous, ongoing. Flight paths are minor or no impact if not associated with release of ordnance (bombing ranges). The noise may have effects on wildlife, including tortoises (e.g., Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>5.1.1 Biological resource use: hunting &amp; trapping terrestrial animals: intentional use (species is the target)<br/>&#160; a. Illegal collecting of <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>for commercial sale, food, cultural purposes, and for international trade, etc.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Tortoises have been and continue to be collected for pets, food, tourism,&#160;commercial sale, and cultural purposes, although such collection has been unlawful since 1939 (Berry 1984, Berry <em>et al</em>. 1996, Berry and Murphy 2019, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.1 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: recreational activities<br/>&#160; a. Visits to State and National Parks and Preserves, National Recreation Areas, federal and state lands, private lands, and Open Recreation Use Areas (unrestricted vehicle play areas) by vehicle-oriented recreationists.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe impacts regionally and locally, especially in the western, central, and southern Mojave Desert and growing in the western Sonoran Desert; associated with proximity to cities, towns, and settlements. Formerly populated with Desert Tortoises, several intensively used areas are now severely degraded and have few if any tortoises (e.g., Bury and Luckenbach 2002, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014a, USFWS 2015, Berry and Murphy 2019). Vehicle-oriented visitation is exceptionally high, ranging from &gt;50,000 to 86,550 between 2008 and 2018 annually in some regions of the Mojave Desert (USBLM 2019). Other parts of the desert and critical habitat are also experiencing growing numbers of visitors. Deaths of desert tortoises from road kills and shooting is higher in areas with high levels of vehicle-oriented visitation (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.2 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: war, civil unrest &amp; military exercises<br/>&#160; a. World War II and subsequent. Military manoeuvres across substantial areas of habitat in the western Sonoran and eastern Mojave deserts to train troops using tanks and other vehicles for the war in North Africa. Since the 1960s, military manoeuvres with armoured vehicles in extensive areas in the western, southern, and central Mojave deserts; aerial bombing training in limited areas in the western Sonoran Desert.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Military manoeuvres in 1942 resulted in severely degraded habitat (compacted soils, damaged desert pavements, altered vegetation, including forage available for desert tortoises. Lands disturbed in 1942 have not recovered after 60 years (Prose 1985, 1986; Prose and Wilshire 2000). Similar disturbances have occurred and continue to occur in tortoise populations and habitat at military installations in the southern and central Mojave Desert. In the early 2000s, expansion of the Fort Irwin military installation in the central Mojave Desert caused loss and degradation of 760 km<sup>2</sup> of tortoise habitat and <em>ca</em>. 304 km<sup>2</sup> of the lost habitat was part of critical habitat (USFWS 2010, Berry and Murphy 2019). An estimated <em>ca</em>. 300 km<sup>2</sup> will be lost with additional, ongoing expansion of the same base. The western expansion of the Marine Corps base at 29 Palms caused hundreds of tortoises to be translocated and habitat lost in the southern Mojave Desert (USDD 2017).<br/><br/>6.3 Work and other activities: law enforcement, illegal immigrants, species research, vandalism<br/>&#160; a. Border patrol agents and illegal immigrants travel cross-country by foot and vehicle in tortoise habitat in the southern border range. Vandalism, specifically wanton shooting or killing of tortoises has affected some populations more than others, probably associated with higher visitor use and vehicle-oriented recreation.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, moderate severity. Border patrol agents travel north from the border into tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, to apprehend illegal immigrants. Vehicle travel can occur off dirt roads, widen existing roads, and create new disturbances. Shooting tortoises, running over them deliberately with vehicles, or otherwise killing them has been documented in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>7.1.1 Fires &amp; fire suppression<br/>&#160; a. Caused by lightning, car fires on highways or roads, arson.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, severe, with the severity dependent on the critical habitat unit or protected area. Mojave and Colorado Desert habitats did not evolve with fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Fires increased in numbers, frequency, and amounts burned with the invasion and proliferation of non-native grasses which are highly combustible (Berry and Murphy 2019). Fires have occurred throughout the geographic range and have burned significant amounts of critical and other protected habitats in the southern, central, eastern and northeastern Mojave Desert regions. Once habitat burns, it is likely to burn again with higher frequencies and with potentially increased biomass of non-native annual grasses. Tortoises die in these fires or are injured, but some survive (Berry and Murphy 2019). Loss of cover of shrubs and food supply for the tortoises is severe in most burned areas. When fires are very hot, the seed bed may be damaged or destroyed. The most severely burned protected habitat is in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve with &gt;30% burned as of summer 2020 (McLuckie <em>et al</em>. 2021); the Mojave National Preserve also experienced a major fire and loss or degradation of 7% of the critical habitat unit in summer 2020 (Darby <em>et al</em>. 2021). <br/><br/>7.2.8 Abstraction of ground water<br/>&#160; a. For agriculture, primarily, followed by urban and cities.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, long-term degradation of habitat adjacent to cities, towns, industrial and agricultural developments. Depletion of the ground water table causing subsidence and formation of fissures has occurred in at least one part of the western Mojave Desert and in the northeastern Mojave Desert in the Las Vegas Valley in what was once desert tortoise habitat (Berry 1984, Burbey 2002). In the western Mojave Desert, the water table was depleted by agricultural uses (cotton, alfalfa) and now with solar energy development; and by cities in the Las Vegas Valley by depleted associated aquifers. Other regions have and continue to experience depletion of the water table in areas with agriculture and desert cities, e.g., adjacent to the Mojave, Colorado, and Virgin rivers (Stamos <em>et al</em>. 2001). Water is sought from sources and regions outside desert tortoise habitat (e.g., the Colorado River) to support cities and towns, as well as agriculture, because existing water tables are insufficient to support them.<br/><br/>8.1.2 Invasive and other problematic species, genes &amp; diseases: Named species<br/>&#160; a.&#160;<em>Bromus madritensis </em>ssp<em>. rubens, B. tectorum, Schismus </em>spp<em>., Erodium cicutarium, Hirschfeldia incana, Brassica tournefortii.<br/></em>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation of the Mojave and western Sonoran ecosystems. Landscape conservation forecasting (Provencher <em>et al</em>. 2011) quantified the pervasive abundance of annual brome grasses that foster destructive wildfires of a size and intensity far greater than the fire regime with which Mojave Desert habitats developed over the past millennia.&#160;In addition to supporting fires, the non-native grasses compete with native forage species of forbs required by tortoises to grow, reproduce, and remain healthy. Non-native grasses and forbs dominate the ecosystem in biomass in both wet and dry years in many tortoise habitats (Brooks and Berry 2006, Berry 2014b). Non-native grasses are not nutritious plants for tortoises to eat and cause weight loss and can cause death in juveniles (Hazard <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The awns of <em>Bromus</em> also can injure tortoise mouths. The non-native <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em> and especially <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, introduced through agricultural development, also compete with native forage species, changing the composition of the native flora (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b). They are not eaten by tortoises and can be high in oxalates, potentially a source of oxalosis in tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>8.1.2 Diseases. Named species<br/>&#160; a. Infectious diseases: <em>Mycoplasma agassizii, M. testudineum, </em>Testudinid herpesvirus 2 (TeHV2); Non-infectious diseases: oxalosis, gout, starvation, dehydration.<br/>&#160; b. Infectious diseases: ongoing, severe in some areas. The two species of <em>Mycoplasma</em> are infectious pathogens. The first (<em>M. agassizii</em>) was discovered in wild populations in 1989 and the second (<em>M. testudineum</em>) a few years later (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2014). These pathogens are spread by contact between tortoises cause disease and death in some populations, and inhibit olfaction necessary for foraging (Jacobson and Berry 2012, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Mycoplasma agassizii</em> is common in captive desert tortoises, more so than in wild populations. Epidemiological studies indicate that the distribution of the two species differs, and that tortoises with antibody-positive tests for the diseases occur closer to human habitations rather than more distant (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mycoplasmosis has been implicated as a major contributor to a catastrophic die-off of tortoises at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2020b). It is also associated with declines in other parts of the geographic range (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160; Non-infectious diseases of known etiology include oxalosis, gout, and starvation and dehydration (Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Some individuals and populations have been negatively affected by these diseases.<br/><br/>8.2.2 Problematic Native Species<br/>&#160; a. The Common Raven (<em>Corvus corax)</em>, an uncommon to rare resident between the 1920s and 1940s in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts, is now an abundant predator in ecosystems where the Desert Tortoise lives.&#160;Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>) is another similar predator, and Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) can also be a hyper-predator.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe and negative effects on population structure; loss of juveniles and immature tortoises. Populations of the Common Raven have grown enormously, supported by subsidies of food, water, perch and nest sites available from humans (Boarman 1993, Boarman and Berry 1995). They have been able to access formerly remote parts of the desert by relying on settlements, road kills and trash along highways and roads, and utility poles and transmission lines for perching and nesting (Knight and Kawashima 1993). Common Ravens are very effective predators on hatchling, juvenile and immature tortoises, with dozens to hundreds of shells recorded beneath perch and nest sites. They are responsible for preventing recovery in many parts of the desert by depleting young tortoise cohorts in populations that can lead to local extinctions (Kristan and Boarman 2003). Red-tailed Hawks have expanded their use areas into remote parts of the desert ecosystems, using utility poles and towers as nest sites and juvenile tortoises for food (Anderson and Berry 2019). Similarly, Coyotes are subsidized predators found in increased numbers near cities, towns, and some military installations and at times have high predation rates on tortoises (Esque <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>8.4.2 Problematic Species/ Diseases: Named Species<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Several non-native species of tortoises and turtles carrying disease or potentially carrying disease have been released illegally into Desert Tortoise habitats, e.g., African Spurred Tortoise (<em>Centrochelys</em> <em>sulcata</em>; Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018) and Central Asian Steppe Tortoise (<em>Testudo horsfieldii</em>; Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe. Releases of tortoises, whether native or non-native are illegal in large parts of the geographic range. Nevertheless, introduced, non-native turtles and tortoises such as the African Spurred Tortoise and Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise have been found to carry new diseases that would negatively affect already declining <em>G. agassizii </em>populations (Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018). The African Spurred Tortoise can do damage to habitat and to the native tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, because of the large size and aggressive nature. One Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise was captured in the Central Mojave Desert with a new herpesvirus not previously described in <em>G. agassizii&#160;</em>(Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The concern is that this non-native tortoise may have transmitted the new herpesvirus to desert tortoises. New, non-native herpesviruses from other species and countries and continents are a threat to health in already declining <em>G. agassizii</em> populations.<br/><br/>8.5 Viral/Prion-induced Diseases<br/>&#160; a. Herpesviruses are implicated in illness and mortality in tortoises.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe if coupled with other stressors. Herpesviruses are a threat to health and survival of desert tortoises, especially those herpesviruses introduced from other, non-native species to the desert. Tortoises with clinical signs of the disease were among populations that severely declined between the 1990s and 2000s; herpesvirus may have contributed in some areas (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Testudinid herpesvirus 2 was first identified in captive tortoises, then confirmed in wild <em>G. agassizii</em> (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The estimated prevalence of this herpesvirus for captive and wild tortoises from the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts ranged from 15 to 56% (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>8.6 Diseases of Unknown Cause<br/>&#160; a. Shell diseases, i.e., cutaneous dyskeratosis, necrosis.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. A novel shell disease, cutaneous dyskeratosis and shell necrosis, was implicated in illness and deaths of Desert Tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1994; Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2001) and a decline of ca. 80% in a once-robust population. Other populations in critical habitats appear to be affected similarly. This is a metabolic disease with lesions of the shell and integument as outward manifestations. The causes are suspected to be toxicants (e.g., elemental toxicants and/or nutritional deficiencies). The disease is implicated in elevated death rates in adult tortoises in the western Sonoran Desert and eastern Mojave Desert (Berry and Medica 1995, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>9.2.2 Industrial &amp; military effluents<br/>&#160; a. Seepage from mining.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, unremediated regionally. There are links between some diseases in tortoises and toxicants from mining and other similar developments. Tortoises dying of upper respiratory tract disease caused by <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp. in the western Mojave Desert in close proximity to a mining district had high levels of mercury in livers compared to tortoises without the disease (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991). Ill tortoises with high levels of arsenic occurred in an area mining district with high levels of mercury and arsenic (Selzer and Berry 2005). Waste from the mines was transported by wind and water to distances of 15 km (Chaffee and Berry 2006; Kim et al. 2012, 2014). Mines in other tortoise habitat in different desert regions have yet to be examined.</p><p>9.4 Garbage &amp; Solid Waste<br/>&#160; a. Trash is a threat to tortoises because they can consume it or become entangled.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, low to moderate. Consumption of trash can lead to illness and death (Donoghue 2006, Walde <em>et al</em>. 2007). Balloons and other trash are common throughout the desert and most abundant near human habitations, along roads, and recreation use areas (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, 2014a; Keith <em>et al</em>. 2008). Trash attracts predators—Common Ravens, Coyotes, and other canids—thus creating an additional risk to tortoises.<br/><br/>9.5 Air-borne Pollutants<br/>&#160; a. Pollutants such as atmospheric nitrogen and increases in CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the growth of invasive grasses and thus fire.<br/>&#160; b. Atmospheric nitrogen from urban or other areas is transported to deserts and tortoise habitat, and deposited on soils, thus enhancing growth of non-native grasses and plants prone to fire (Brooks 2003, Rao and Allen 2010).<br/><br/>11.1 Habitat Shifting &amp; Alteration<br/>&#160; a. Desertification; degradation of vegetation, soils, and topography<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Throughout the geographic range, most, if not all, tortoise habitats have received (and continue to receive) one or more anthropogenic uses and activities resulting in compacted or eroded soils and alteration of the natural structure and composition of annual and perennial vegetation (e.g., Lei 2009). Long-lived shrubs and native annual wildflowers and grasses have been replaced in part with short-lived colonizers (shrubs, non-native, fire-prone grasses) typical of disturbed areas. These changes have brought fewer places to dig burrows and a reduced supply of nutritious plants to eat (Brooks and Berry 2006, Webb and Wilshire 1983). In some areas, the rich diversity of shrubs and annual plants have been replaced by a few shrub species and the annuals replaced with primarily non-native annual species (Brooks and Berry 2006).<br/><br/>11.2 Droughts<br/>&#160; a. Desert Tortoises require water from precipitation and a diverse diet of native annuals to grow, reproduce and survive.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, increasingly severe with reduced survival throughout the geographic range, often associated with hyper-predation by coyotes. Although the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts are typified by droughts often lasting more than a year, tortoises have adaptations to cope. However, tortoises die of starvation and dehydration during prolonged droughts (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2002, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003, Longshore <em>et al</em>. 2003, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014). Juveniles are especially vulnerable. With climate change and warming, droughts, including megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, are predicted to occur in coming years (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2017, Steiger <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>11.3 Temperature Extremes<br/>&#160; a. Tortoises are able to withstand the extremes of temperature experienced in the desert; however, increases in warm temperatures coupled with drying and changes in precipitation patterns present high risks to the species.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing and a growing issue, with climate change having negative impacts throughout the geographic range. Tortoises cope with the extremes of summer and winter temperatures (and lack of water, see 11.2) by using deep burrows and restricting above-ground activities and reproduction during drought. As temperatures rise with the rise in CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, tortoises will need to find habitats where deeper burrows can be excavated. At the higher temperatures, the spring season for foraging on ephemeral annuals and egg laying is likely to be shortened, reducing the time for eating, growing, and egg production. Sex of tortoises is determined by temperature of incubation in nests, with females produced at the higher temperatures and males at the lower temperatures. Eggs laid in nest that will experience the high temperatures of summer may be predominantly female, and if temperatures are excessive, may not be viable. Although the species could survive at higher (and cooler) elevations, the habitat in mountain ranges will be more limited, steep, rocky, with exposed bedrock in places with inadequate forage.<br/><br/>12.1 Other Threats<br/>&#160; a. Climate Change.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, see 11.2 and 11.3. Change in timing and amounts of precipitation coupled with increasing temperatures are likely to have profound negative effects on the species, further reducing available habitat (e.g., Barrows 2011). Profound changes are predicted to cause deterioration in composition, structure, diversity and biomass of trees and shrubs (Munson et al. 2016) that provide shade and cover to the tortoises. Barrows (2011) predicted that tortoises may survive if they move from the western Colorado Desert to higher elevations.&#160; However, the long-lived tortoises have strong fidelity to existing home ranges.</p>","Population estimates and trends have previously been difficult to obtain with certainty for large segments of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> populations due to their patchy distribution, difficulty of detection, and associated statistical weaknesses of population estimates. Population data have been variously documented or reviewed by Woodbury and Hardy (1948), Hardy (1976), Berry (1984, 1986, 1989), Bury and Corn (1995),&#160;Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Berry and Murphy (2019). A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;by Allison and McLuckie (2018) has demonstrated continued adult population declines in four of the five&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units and low densities in nearly all subpopulations near the minimum required to remain viable (3.9 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>Between the 1930s and early 2000s, estimates of density and trends in populations were based on demographic data, habitat condition, and anthropogenic threats from both long- and short-term study plots of varying sizes, as well as reports by government agency personnel and expert observers (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948; Hardy 1976; Berry 1984, 1989). The study plots were limited in number and did not represent the entirety of subpopulations across the geographic range (e.g., Berry 1984). The subpopulation on the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah, was federally listed as threatened in 1980 (USFWS 1980). A petition submitted by the Desert Tortoise Council in 1984 to list all wild populations in the United States was denied; the USFWS determined that listing of U.S. populations was warranted but precluded because of other higher priorities (USFWS&#160;<span style="""">1985</span>). In 1989 and 1990, the State of California and USFWS listed the tortoise as threatened (USFWS <span style="""">1989,&#160;1990;</span> California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2016). The appearance of upper respiratory tract disease and rapidly declining populations in the western Mojave and a major decline in tortoises in parts of the western Sonoran (Colorado Desert, California) associated with appearance of shell disease were additional threats to the many causes of declines (USFWS 1990, 1994, and references therein). Reflecting its concern over these declines, USFWS (1994:3) stated that: “The most serious problem facing the remaining desert tortoise population is the cumulative load of human and disease-related mortality accompanied by habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. Virtually every extant desert tortoise subpopulation has been affected by one or more of these factors.” As a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994) also designated federal critical habitat units for desert tortoises at that time.&#160;In October 2020, the California Fish and Wildlife Commission accepted a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to up-list wild desert tortoises from threatened to endangered status; California has the largest subpopulation and geographic range of the species. The petition is currently under consideration by the agency with a response estimated in 2021.<br/><br/>To better measure trends in densities of adult populations in the threatened subpopulations, the Recovery Team proposed development of a landscape scale program (USFWS 1994). At the same time, the Recovery Team also noted the importance of study plot data, because more population attributes were provided than density of adults. After experimenting with different techniques, the USFWS decided to use distance sampling and initiated a formal, range-wide program for estimating densities of adult populations in critical habitat units (USFWS 2015, and references therein).<br/><br/>In the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994), population size, viability, and sizes of protected areas were discussed. Assuming the minimum density of adults in a population was “approximately 10 adults per square mile” (equivalent to 3.9 adults/km<sup>2</sup>), the target size for protected areas (then called Desert Wildlife Management Areas) was approximately 1,000 mi<sup>2</sup> (ca. 2,590 km<sup>2</sup>). This would ensure that even at such low densities and assuming half of such large areas might support no or few tortoises, each protected area would support enough adults for a genetically minimum viable population. The Recovery Team recommended six Recovery units with 12 different populations. The updated Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011) is based on the same number of populations but configured into five revised Recovery units with 17 different monitored subpopulations.<br/><br/>Most demographic data from study plots collected from the 1930s on the Beaver Dam Slope and between 1979–1980 in California and Nevada during the spring season indicated counts of 5–64 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Berry and Murphy 2019). In describing trends between 1978 and 1990 in California, the USFWS summarized data from 10 study plots in the Mojave and Colorado deserts and reported a highly significant downward trend (USFWS 1994). Additional data for the period showed some populations with low but potentially stable densities in Nevada (Berry and Medica 1995). A review of population status (Tracy <em>et al</em>. 2004) considered updated information from the permanent study plots in California and found that population declines in the western part of the range in California continued and declines were perhaps beginning in the eastern part of the California range.<br/><br/>The current population trends are based on landscape-level assessment using distance sampling for the 11-year period between 2004 and 2014 (USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). The sampling represented all five recovery units with 16 subpopulations in critical habitat units of from 115 to 3,763 km<sup>2</sup> described in the original Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994). Joshua Tree National Park is treated as a protected area and monitored as a 17th subpopulation although not designated as critical habitat. Consistent downward trends have continued in four of the five recovery units, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 11 years. Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014; the exceptions were adult densities in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) and the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (10.2/km<sup>2</sup>) (Berry et al. 2014, 2020). Unfortunately, in July 2020, a significant part of the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve burned and tortoises were found injured and dead. The Red Cliffs subpopulation declined from 2005 wildfires and with the recent 2020 fires, there will likely be further depression in densities. The six subpopulations with increasing densities had 2.7 to 6.4 adults/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2014. However, most of the 17 populations were near or below the 3.9 /km<sup>2</sup>&#160;density of adults considered as a minimum for viable populations (USFWS 1994, 2015).",Decreasing,"The Desert Tortoise was previously considered to be a single wide-ranging species, <em>Gopherus agassizii</em>, inhabiting the Mojave and Sonoran Desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico from southern California and Arizona through Sonora and into northern Sinaloa (Stebbins 1966, 2003; Iverson 1992). The species was found to be polytypic by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2011), who split the morphologically and genetically distinct Sonoran Desert populations as <em>Gopherus morafkai</em>, the Sonoran Desert Tortoise. Further analysis demonstrated that <em>G. morafkai</em> was also polytypic and split further to separate and describe the Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise further to the south as <em>Gopherus evgoodei</em> (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Geographically restricted <em>G. agassizii</em>, the Mojave or Agassiz’s Desert Tortoise, is endemic to the United States, inhabiting southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and extreme northwestern Arizona west and north of the Colorado River (TTWG 2017, Berry and Murphy 2019). The Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai</em>, occurs in both the United States and Mexico, inhabiting Arizona south and east of the Colorado River, Sonora (including Isla Tiburón), and extreme northern Sinaloa (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2011, TTWG 2017). The Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise, <em>G. evgoodei</em>, is endemic to Mexico and occurs in southern Sonora, northern Sinaloa, and extreme southwestern Chihuahua (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016, TTWG 2017).<br/><br/>Within its geographic range, <em>G. agassizii</em> occurs in the Mojave Desert, the western Sonoran or Colorado Desert, the ecotone of the Mojave with the Great Basin Desert, and ecotones with vegetation types typical of higher elevations on the lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada, Transverse, Peninsular and desert mountain ranges (USFWS 1994). McLuckie <em>et al</em>. (1999) identified a subpopulation of <em>G. agassizii</em> east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of northwestern Arizona in which morphometric and mtDNA characteristics of the majority of the subpopulation were typically Mojavean; however, elements typical of tortoises in the Sonoran Desert were also evident. Edwards <em>et al.</em> (2015), using new genetic techniques, examined this and other nearby tortoise subpopulations, and identified hybrids (F2) in three mountain ranges near the Colorado River in Arizona. The two <em>Gopherus</em> species come in contact in limited places where Mojave Desert habitats meet Sonoran Desert habitats. The two species likely maintain largely independent taxonomic identities due to ecological niche partitioning (Inman <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species has been recorded at elevations of up to&#160;1,570 m asl (Rautenstrauch and O’Farrell 1998); however, tortoises may be found in unusual places, often transported by humans or other animals (e.g., the type specimen of <em>Xerobates lepidocephalus</em>&#160;[Ottley and Velázquez-Solis 1989] from southern Baja California, Mexico, is actually an introduced <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>[Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2011]).","Commercial take or use of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is prohibited by law, and few animals have been documented in (illegal) trade in recent decades. The evaluation of conservation status, conservation and monitoring actions for the species have generated significant financial investments in the species, supporting a range of local and visiting livelihoods. The approximate cost to develop and implement the 25-year recovery program for the Mojave Desert Tortoise was USD 100 million (USGAO 2002, Ernst and Lovich 2009, USFWS 2011, Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thirty years have passed since the federal listing of&#160; <em>G. agassizii</em> as threatened in 1989–1990, declines of breeding adults continue, and many tasks to reduce deaths, described first in 1994 (USFWS 1994), remain to be implemented (see also USFWS 2011, Reports from the Recovery Implementation Teams). If fully implemented, the recommended actions could exceed 159 million USD plus additional costs that could not be estimated in the 2011 Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011). As one of the keystone species of the Mojave Desert, <em>G. agassizii</em> plays an unquantified but substantial role in generating tourism income to regional protected areas (see Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/"">https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/</a>).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation Measures taken:<br/></strong>The first legal conservation measures for <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> came from the State of California in 1939 (California Department of Fish and Game Code 1939–1981).&#160;Additional protective regulations followed until <em>G. agassizii </em>was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 1989 (California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife 2016). Federal legislation to protect <em>G. agassizii</em> first occurred in 1980 and was restricted to the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah (USFWS 1980). In 1989–1990, <em>G. agassizii</em> was federally listed as threatened (USDI&#160;<span style="""">1990&#160;</span>and references therein). The only population of <em>G. agassizii</em> that is not protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is in the northwest corner of Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery efforts have been underway since 1990. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1994) published the first Recovery Plan in 1994, coupled with designations of critical habitat units by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994); this was followed by a revised Recovery Plan in 2011 (USFWS 2011), and regional Recovery Implementation Teams established in 2012. These teams are chaired by an employee of the USFWS Desert Tortoise Recovery Office, and are composed of federal, state, and county employees from the range of the desert tortoise, including representatives from local and national conservation and other stakeholder organizations. <br/><br/>The species is included in CITES Appendix II as part of Testudinidae spp., requiring that any commercial international trade be documented not to be detrimental to the survival of wild populations. CITES Trade records generally show very low levels of international exports of live animals; the vast majority of live traded Desert Tortoises are personal pets moving in-country with their owners, and many of the records in fact concern seizures of illegally transported specimens (CITES UNEP-WCMC trade database).<br/><br/>Conservation and recovery efforts began in the early 1970s, long before efforts of the federal actions by the USFWS in 1989–90. The Desert Tortoise Council formed in 1974-75 out of an interim recovery effort involving the four Southwestern states. This non-profit corporation was and continues to be dedicated to preserving representative populations of desert tortoises; educating the public; holding annual introductory workshops; and annual symposia to bring together representatives from government agencies, academia, and the public to learn and discuss important topics aimed at recovery of tortoise populations. The Desert Tortoise Council was instrumental in providing critical materials for federal and state listings of the species. The Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, Inc., was formed in 1974 to establish protected areas for <em>G. agassizii</em>. This non-profit organization is a land trust and mitigation bank, a source of education, and research. They were instrumental in establishing the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area and increasing its size.<br/><br/>Two preserves or protected areas exist with moderately high degrees of protection. One is the 100 km<sup>2</sup> (and increasing) Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area, which was formally designated by the U.S. Congress in 1980. It is fenced, with no vehicle access, livestock grazing, mining, or surface disturbances other than a few limited natural trails and a kiosk. The Natural Area is for wild tortoises only and populations are allowed to fluctuate naturally with no augmentation. Population density of adults throughout the Natural Area in 2011-12 was 10.2/km<sup>2</sup> (Berry et al. 2014a). The second preserve is Red Cliffs Desert Reserve in Utah (251 km<sup>2</sup>). The Red Cliffs National Conservation Area provides additional protection for federal lands within the Reserve. Several paved roads, fenced and unfenced, run through the Reserve and recreation occurs throughout (e.g., hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking).&#160;The next and lower level of protection could be described as occurring within National Parks, State Parks, and National Recreation Areas such as Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, Mojave National Preserve, Red Rock Canyon, Anza-Borrego, and Red Rocks State Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and the Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area. These parks and recreation areas have very high visitor use, unfenced paved roads, and some illegal collecting and release of captive tortoises of one or more species. <br/><br/>Twelve critical habitat units, the basis for Tortoise Conservation Areas (term defined in USFWS 2011), were designated by the USFWS (1994), and have far less protection than either the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area or the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and are subject to multiple land uses that fragment and degrade habitat and create vulnerabilities and risks to the tortoises (e.g., invasive non-native grasses and other non-native species; highways; roads; utility poles, towers, and electrical transmission lines; gas lines and fibreoptic cables; recreational vehicle use; shooting; domestic and feral dogs; cattle grazing and feral burros; mining; military installations; fire that causes degradation of habitat).<br/><br/>Seventeen monitored subpopulations in the 12 critical habitat units are contained within five recovery units which cover a total of 25,678 km<sup>2</sup>. The following information for each recovery unit and the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas reports area (km<sup>2</sup>), and density of breeding adults per km<sup>2</sup> in 2014. Western Mojave Recovery Unit: Fremont-Kramer (2,347 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Ord-Rodman (852 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Superior-Cronese (3,094 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Colorado Desert Recovery Unit: Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range (713 km<sup>2</sup>, 7.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Chuckwalla (2,818 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.3/km<sup>2</sup>), Chemehuevi (3,763 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Fenner (1,782 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Joshua Tree (1,152 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Pinto Mountain (508 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Piute Valley (927 km<sup>2</sup>, 5.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Eastern Mojave Recovery Unit: El Dorado Valley (999 km<sup>2</sup>, 1.5/km<sup>2</sup>), Ivanpah Valley (2,447 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit: Beaver Dam Slope (750 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Coyote Spring (960 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.0/km<sup>2</sup>), Gold Butte (1,607 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Mormon Mesa (844 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit: Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (115 km<sup>2</sup>, 15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2015; Allison and McLuckie 2018). The overall decline in tortoise populations in critical habitats (Tortoise Conservation Areas) between 2004 and 2014 was 32.2% (USFWS 2015). Four of the five recovery units are in a state of decline, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 10 years (USFWS 2015). Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014 (USFWS 2015).<br/><br/>Extensive research has been published in peer-reviewed journals on many aspects of natural history, general ecology, physiological ecology, reproduction, health and diseases, population attributes, causes of death, movements and home range, predators, head-starting, translocation, and many other topics, making <em>G. agassizii</em> likely the most well-researched non-marine turtle species (Lovich and Ennen 2013b). Over 400 journal articles were published as of 2018, most between 1990 and 2018, as well as hundreds of reports (see three annotated bibliographies covering almost 160 years: Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980, Grover and DeFalco 1995, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016). Some information has been integrated into recovery programs, but many of the recovery measures recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) have not been implemented as of 2020.<br/><br/>Economic relevance: The approximate cost of USD 100 million to develop and implement the first and second Recovery Plans is significant within the regulatory, scientific and local economic sectors involved and much remains to be implemented (USFWS 1994, 2011; Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Measures needed:<br/></strong>The USFWS (1994) published recommended regulations for the areas that were designated as critical habitat. They described activities to be prohibited (e.g., all vehicle activity off designated roads; all competitive and organized recreational vehicle events on designated roads; habitat destructive military manoeuvres, clearing for agriculture, landfills and other surface disturbances; domestic livestock grazing, grazing by feral burros and horses; vegetation harvest; collection of biological specimens or vegetation harvest except by permit; dumping and littering; and deposition of captive or displace desert tortoises except under authorized translocation research projects; uncontrolled dogs out of vehicles; discharge of firearms except for hunting of game between September and February. There were many other recommended management actions but few of these recommendations were adopted when critical habitat units were officially described (USFWS 1994), and others have only been partially implemented by 2020.&#160;There were also recommendations for monitoring and research. In the second recovery plan, the USFWS (2011) identified and ranked (Darst <em>et al.</em> 2013) priority actions for recovering the Desert Tortoise and established regional Recovery Implementation Teams to implement these recovery actions. These Recovery Implementation Teams identify local, regional, and range-wide actions by submitting proposals to team members for discussion and prioritization. Ultimately the proposals are submitted to range-wide Management Oversight Groups composed of state, federal, and county government agencies for review, discussion, and potential sources of funding. Some projects are successfully funded and implemented, while many recommended in 1994 remain unfulfilled.<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Conservation Actions Needed, we provide the following notes:<br/></strong>1.1. Land/water protection -&gt; Site/area protection<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Better protection of Critical habitats could ensure that populations of tortoises become stable and/or increase. Examples of protective measures included in recovery measures for the tortoise are exclusion fencing and culverts along highways and roads; reduction in populations of hyper-predators such as the Common Ravens; control and removal of newly introduced and previously existing non-native plants; and control of recreational vehicle use.<br/><br/>2.1. Land/water management -&gt; Site/area management<br/>&#160; &#160; a. The first recovery plan identified site-specific or critical habitat-specific measures to ensure protection of habitat and reduction of deaths of tortoises from anthropogenic sources (USFWS 1994). Most of these recommendations are still relevant. The Recovery Implementation Teams have provided recommendations similar to those in the first recovery plan. Many of these measures remain to be implemented. For example, in the State of California where most desert tortoise habitat and populations occur, acquisition of private land would be beneficial, because a substantial portion of habitat is in multiple private ownership. Both the USFWS and State of California recommend that developers of tortoise habitat acquire replacement habitat for habitat lost to development, and such actions have been occurring for ~20 years. Another topic and critical area that would benefit from protection is the population and hybrid zone with <em>G. morafkai</em> east of the Colorado River in Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). This small population is not protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>2.2. Land/water management -&gt; Invasive/problematic species control<br/>&#160; a. Non-native grasses (e.g., <em>Schismus arabicus</em>, <em>S. barbatus</em>, <em>Bromus tectorum</em>, <em>B. madritensis rubens</em>) and forbs (e.g., <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em>) present serious and severe problems to tortoises because tortoises are selective in the choice of forage (Jennings and Berry 2015). The non-native annuals contribute to changes in forage availability, habitat structure, and increases in fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). These non-native species thrive under disturbance and spread via roads, livestock, military maneuvers, and disturbances created by recreational vehicle use off-road (e.g., D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006). The grasses are highly combustible and fire-prone in wildlands that did not evolve with short-term fire cycles (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). The grasses also compete with native annuals used as forage by the tortoises, and the species of grasses contain little nutrition, require water to metabolize, cause weight loss in the tortoises, and can become embedded in the jaws (Medica and Eckert 2007; Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similarly, <em>Brassica tournefortii</em> competes with native species used for forage and often occurs in dense stands, inhibiting movements of tortoises (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).<br/><br/>3.2. Species management -&gt; Species recovery<br/>&#160; a. Species management and recovery are guided by the Recovery Plan and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On-the-ground management is by the administering agency, e.g., U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Department of Defense, States (for state land), and private owners. That being said, much can be done by implementing actions recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) and by restoring degraded habitat (e.g., Abella and Berry 2016); controlling recreation vehicle use off-road and reducing fragmentation of habitat; limiting spread of invasive, non-native grasses and forbs; controlling hyper-predation in common ravens (USFWS 2008)&#160;and coyotes; preventing dogs and dog packs from running loose in the desert; and acquiring habitat.<br/><br/>4.3. Education &amp; awareness -&gt; Awareness &amp; communications<br/>&#160; a. See Conservation Actions in Place. Expansion of on-going programs to prevent take or shooting in the wild and release of captive tortoises of several species.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Research Needed, we provide the following notes:</strong></p>While research on some topics is desirable, more is known about <em>G. agassizii </em>than most other reptiles (Lovich and Ennen 2013b, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016 and references therein). Instead, implementation of previously identified actions to protect populations and habitat is more critical, specifically actions that will reduce deaths and loss or degradation of habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>1.1. Research -&gt; Taxonomy<br/>&#160; a. Genetic relationships between and within populations: human-mediated translocations of tortoises have occurred for decades, some authorized, some not (see Murphy et al. 2007). One recent question is the source of tortoises in Anza Borrego Desert State Park in the Colorado Desert of California. One might expect that the source would be tortoises occurring in the Colorado Desert, but instead tortoises have genotypes typical of the southwestern Mojave Desert population (Manning and Edwards 2019). More information on nearby tortoises (e.g. Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2020) occurring on the east-facing slopes of the Peninsular Range north of the Park may shed light on whether this is a naturally occurring population or a source that came from human-mediated translocations.<br/>&#160; b. Translocation of thousands of tortoises has occurred in the last &gt;20 years. Yet the only information available as to whether these translocated tortoises have been assimilated into the recipient or existing resident populations is research by Mulder <em>et al.</em> (2017) on assimilation of translocated males into the population of resident tortoises. Much more needs to be done on following males and females over a 10- to 20-year period to determine if and when adult males are assimilated into resident populations.<br/><br/>1.2. Research -&gt; Population size, distribution &amp; trends<br/>&#160; a. More information on current population attributes such as size-age class structure, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, sex ratios of adult tortoises, and causes and contributors to death is highly desirable. Landscape sampling undertaken and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Desert Tortoise Recovery Office has provided valuable region-wide information on adult densities but not on other essential population attributes (i.e., Allison and McLuckie 2018). Resurvey of long-term, mark-recapture tortoise plots has been spotty for the past 20 years while support has increased for line-distance sampling representatively and on a landscape scale (see USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). Nonetheless, it is clear (USFWS 2011) that species recovery cannot be assumed based on patterns of adult counts alone, and active work to describe vital rates across the range will be an important part of assuring tortoise populations reflect healthy population dynamics or determining regional and size-specific recovery needs.<br/><br/>1.3. Research -&gt; Life history &amp; ecology<br/>&#160; a. More information is needed on survival of neonate, juvenile, and immature size classes (first 12 to 15 years of life) and causes of mortality in the wild. Frequent input of new data on causes of and contributors to mortality for all size classes is essential for improving management of the species and for achieving upward trends.<br/><br/>1.5. Research -&gt; Threats<br/>&#160; a. The USFWS developed a model to identify major threats to the species (Darst <em>et al</em>. 2013); the information in this model is based on published research only, and not on the hundreds of reports and manuscripts available in Annual Reports to the USFWS on research permits. The model is outdated and needs major revisions to more accurately reflect available information and more recent priorities. In addition, support could be provided to speed up publication of important research projects that will lead to more protective management actions.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>3.1. Monitoring -&gt; Population trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on population attributes in critical habitat, near highways, and in critical habitat near urban areas.<br/><br/>3.4. Monitoring -&gt; Habitat trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on wildfires, non-native plants, seed beds, and recovery of preferred forage plants.<br/><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

In China all subpopulations are small (the largest numbering about 500) and fragmented, and the species appears to be in danger of extirpation in Korea and Viet Nam (possibly already extinct). In terms of applying the Red List Criteria to the species globally, the large subpopulation in Japan masks all population trends from elsewhere within its range, leading to a Least Concern listing. However, it is a priority to conduct new assessments of the mainland subspecies as soon as possible.","This species prefers woodlands and forest with dense understorey, but forages in open grassy areas (Smith and Xie 2008). The main diet includes grass, some browse, and even fruit. The species is crepuscular, but sometimes active by day and night, and forages singly or in small herds, with dominant males with harems. Herds migrate to lower valleys in winter. Adults can live up to 25 years. Typically, mating occurs in autumn and gestation is about 210-223 days with young being born in April and May.<br/><br/>In Tiebu Nature Reserve, Sichuan, Sika were reported to forage preferentially in small patches of subalpine shrub and subalpine brush mixed with forest (Guo 2002). Sika fed on a wide variety of plant species in Teibu. In Viet Nam, diet of <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was reported to included browse and fruits (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In Taiwan, <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> inhabited open forests and grasslands of valley bottoms and foothills below 300 m (McCullough 1974, Horng-jye Su undated). <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> and <em>C. n. grassianus</em> probably occurred in upland forests  (IUCN 1972). <em>C. n. keramae</em> favours lowland forests and plains (WWF 1984). In Viet Nam, <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> group size was 5-30 animals (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In China, <em>C. e. sichuanicus</em> forms large aggregations during May-August (Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm.). In Viet Nam, <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was thought to be primarily sedentary, although some seasonal movement took place depending on water availability (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In China, rut occurs during September-November. Fawning occurs in May-July following a 210-213 day gestation. Single fawns are the rule, but twins are sometimes observed among prime-aged females (Guo and Zheng 2005). Sexual maturity is reached at 1.5 years (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993).","This species is threatened by habitat loss and hunting, particularly in Viet Nam, China, and the Koreas. The species is increasing in Japan (where it is hunted and culled to reduce crop and forest depredation), and stable in Russia and probably Taiwan. The subspecies in Viet Nam (<em>C. n. pseudaxi</em>) and Taiwan (<em>C. n. taiouanus</em>) were hunted for meat and antler velvet for use in traditional medicine (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990, McCullough 1974). In Viet Nam, velvet from <em>Cervus nippon</em> is traded in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). All subspecies of Sika have been hunted widely in China during the past 100 years (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990) and in Korea. In Japan, Red Deer farming used to be very popular, but now animals are being released into the wild raising the risk of hybridization in the wild with <em>Cervus nippon</em>. Native and introduced populations are threatened by hybridization, with numerous populations of uncertain provenance or mixed ancestry (Grubb 2005). In China, in addition to continued loss of habitat, loss of genetic diversity through anthropogenic population subdivision is also a conservation concern (Lu <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> in Viet Nam, and <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> and <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> in China, were probably extirpated in the wild as a result of hunting and habitat conversion for agriculture (Ratajszczak 1990; Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comms.; IUCN 1972). The small captive population of <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> in Cuc Phuong National Park is presently threatened by poaching. In China, <em>C. e. sichuanicus</em> is threatened by poaching outside Tiebu Nature Reserve (Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm. 1990), and by encroachment on their habitats (including by deer farms; Hu 1998). In Japan, <em>C. n. keramae</em> has been almost extirpated by hunting, and remains only on unoccupied islets where competition with feral goats and habitat change constitute serious threats (Anonymous 1990). Water pollution is a serious problem for the deer (WWF 1984).","There are no global population estimates. However, in summary, there is a large and growing population in Japan, and a stable population of 8,500-9,000 in Russia, but the species is in serious trouble in the rest of its range. There are probably fewer than 1,000 left in China, scattered in a few subpopulations across a once vast range. It is extinct in South Korea, and probably extinct in North Korea and Viet Nam. It also became extinct on Taiwan, but has been re-introduced there. More detailed information is provided below.<br/><br/><em>China</em>: Four subspecies of Sika are present in mainland China of which three are threatened and one, <em>C. n. mandarinus</em>, is probably extinct. There are 400-500 <em>C. n. sichuanicus</em> in the extreme north of Sichuan and in southern Gansu Province (Hu 1998), as well in two other areas (Baxi and Beihe) of Sichuan (Guo 2000). <em>C. n. kopschi</em> occurs as five isolated small populations: in the Tianmu Mountains region of northern Zhejiang (less than 30 animals); in southern Anhui (70-100); near the border with Jiangsu, in Pengze, Jiangxi (150 animals); in southern Guangxi; and possibly in northern Guangdong. <em>C. n. grassianus</em> occurred in two separate and declining populations in western Shanxi but has not been reported for some years and may now be extinct (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990; Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm., 1990). The total number in China was estimated to be no more than 1,000 animals, with populations fragments (Hu 1998). Sika are believed to be declining in all of their remaining range within China (Hu 1998, Guo 2000), although  analyses of survival of <em>C. n. sichuanicus</em> in Tiebu Nature Reserve during the late 1980s suggest a possible reversal of that trend (Guo and Zheng 2005).<br/><br/><em>Korea</em>: Sika was reportedly common and widespread in north and central Korea but declined severely during the Japanese occupation of the country. After liberation it proved impossible to rebuild populations naturally from the surviving dispersed animals in Hamgyong North province, so the DPRK government initiated a captive breeding programme (Won Hong Koo 1968). The genetic purity of these animals is unclear as is their relationship to the Sika held captive in DPRK nowadays. Sika is either very rare or extinct as a wild animal in DPR Korea (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). If it survives in DPR Korea, it will be in the extreme northeastern part of the country (Won and Smith 1999). It no longer survives in the wild in South Korea (Won and Smith 1999), including on Cheju Island.<br/><br/><em>Japan</em>: The species survives near heavily populated areas of Honshu, and their populations had been severely fragmented and reduced due to human activities (Yuasa <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, the Sika Deer population has been conspicuously increasing throughout Japan in recent years as hunting has been brought under control. On Hokkaido, for example, Sika have increased greatly during the last decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the early 21<sup>st</sup> century (Agetsuma <em>et al</em>. 2007), and are now considered an agricultural and forest-plantation pest (Uno and Kaji 2006). Experimental hunting of males began in the 1950s, culling of females in the 1980s and hunting of females in the 1990s (Halley <em>et al</em>. 2006). <em>C. n. keramae</em> was introduced to the Kerama Islands from the Japanese mainland during the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and is reported to have subsequently developed as an insular form (IUCN 1972).<br/><br/><em>Russia</em>: According to Kuzyakin (n.d.), there are 8,500-9,000 Sika Deer in Russia, and the population is stable.<br/><br/><em>Taiwan</em>: <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> is endemic to Taiwan. It was extirpated by 1969 and re-introduced to Kenting National Park in 1988 (Green 1989).  <br/><br/><em>Viet Nam</em>: The species may now be extinct in the wild in this country. In 1990, two to four animals were reported from the western Nghe Tinh Mountains (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990), but it is highly doubtful that they survive there. Captive populations are present in Cuc Phuong National Park and Cat Ba National Park (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990).",Increasing,"The Sika was distributed across east Asia, from central China in the west to Japan and Korea in the east, and from the extreme eastern tip of Russia in the north to southern China and Viet Nam. Specifically, it was originally found in China (formerly from Manchuria south to Guangxi, and Sichuan to Anhui), North and South Korea (including Cheju Island) (but now probably extinct in both countries), Japan, Russia (a few places in Primorsky in the Far East), Taiwan (extinct in 1969, but subsequently re-introduced), and Viet Nam (probably now extinct). Wild populations are now very localized in China. In Japan, the species ranges widely from Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, islands in the Seto Inland Sea (Awaji, Shodo, and others), Goto Islands, Ika, Yakushima, Mageshima, Kuchinoerabu-shima, Tsushima, and the Kerama Islands (introduced) (Okinawa Prefecture) (Abe 2005).<br/><br/>In China, <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> probably ranged across much of northeastern China, but by the mid-1930s its range had contracted to northeastern Jilin (IUCN 1972, Guo 1992), and is now believed to be extinct (Hu 1998, Smith and Xie 2008). <em>C. n. grassianus</em> ranged throughout western Shanxi Province, China (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Guo 1992), and is now believed to be extinct (Hu 1998, Smith and Xie 2008).<em> C. n. kopschi</em> ranged from the Yangtze River Basin eastward to the coast, and south as far as northern Guangdong Province (IUCN 1972); it remains in small numbers in southern China. <em>C. e. taiouanus</em> was widely distributed throughout Taiwan (Green 1989). Free ranging populations were extirpated in 1969, but captive individuals were re-introduced in 1989 (Smith and Xie 2008). <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was recorded from Cao Bang, Quang Ninh, Thanh Hoa, Hanoi, and Nghe Tinh provinces in Viet Nam (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990), but is probably now extinct in the wild (captive animals remain). <br/><br/>The species has been widely introduced. In the Philippines it was anciently introduced to Solo Island, with questions remaining as to its continued existence there. It was introduced in 17<sup>th</sup> century to Kerama Islands (Ryukyu Islands, Japan); and introduced in 19<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries to British Isles, mainland Europe (Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, western Russia, and Ukraine), New Zealand, USA, and small islands off Japan (Whitehead 1993, Wemmer 1998, Grubb, 2005). It is also widely farmed in Asia, particularly in China (Green <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Smith and Xie 2008).

However, subspecies <em>Capreolus capreolus italicus</em> is rare (&lt;10,000 mature individuals) and faces serious threats. <em>C. c. coxi </em>is probably also at risk in the Middle East.","It occupies a wide variety of habitats, including deciduous, mixed or coniferous forests, moorland, pastures, arable land, and suburban areas with large gardens. It prefers landscapes with a mosaic of woodland and farmland (Stubbe 1999) but can survive in semi-desert environments and above the tree line seasonally. Roe Deer are well adapted to modern agricultural landscapes (Andersen <em>et al.</em> 1998, Danilkin 1996, Sempéré <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The main threat in Europe is the increased mixing of various genetic pools as a result of translocations. This may be a particular threat to genetically distinct peripheral populations, such as those in northern Portugal, the southern Italian Apennines, and Greece (Randi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006). Molecular studies show that Roe Deer in central and southern Europe are mainly admixed (Lorenzini <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Randi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), indicating that human manipulation has greatly affected the natural genetic structure of populations. The small isolated populations of <em>Capreolus c. italicus</em> in central and southern Italy (Castelporziano, Rome, and Gargano National Park) are also threatened by poaching and predation by free-ranging dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> (Lorenzini <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). The small remnant population in Syria is under severe threat from habitat reduction and human persecution (Masseti 2000). Illegal hunting, poaching, collisions with vehicles mainly in the western Black Sea Region, and predation by dogs, are the main threats to the species in Turkey.","It is widespread and common, and is expanding in many areas. Having almost gone extinct in parts of southern Europe because of habitat loss and over-harvesting in the first half of the last century, its numbers started increasing again 20-40 years ago because of countryside abandonment, improved hunting regimes and reintroductions (Gortázar <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Densities in the northern and southern parts of the range tend to be lower than in the central parts of the range. The central European population is estimated to number <em>c. </em>15 million individuals. However, the endemic Italian subspecies <em>Capreolus c. italicus</em>, which is largely restricted to southern Tuscany, probably numbers no more than 10,000 individuals and is at significant risk from hybridization with introduced <em>C. c. capreolus </em>(Lorenzini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Mucci <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), which has a large, expanding population in the Italian peninsula. In addition, a small population of <em>C. c. capreolus</em> has been introduced to and kept in an enclosure in Nebrodi National Park on Sicily (Masseti 2011).<br/><br/>In Turkey, the population is estimated at 6,000-8,000 individuals and has been probably increasing in the Black Sea region for two decades due to rural population declines (H. Ambarli pers. comm.).",Increasing,"The Roe Deer has a large range in the Palaearctic. It is found through most of Europe (with the exception of Ireland, Cyprus, Corsica, Sardinia, and most of the smaller islands), including western Russia (Stubbe 1999). Outside Europe, it occurs in Turkey, northern Syria, northern Iraq, northern Iran, and the Caucasus (Wilson and Reeder 2005). Along the Black Sea coast and in the northern Aegean region of Turkey, the Mediterranean sub-populations are close to extinction. It is extinct in Israel and Lebanon (Wilson and Reeder 2005) (though a re-introduction programme has started in Israel (M. Masseti pers. comm.). It occurs from sea level up to 2,400 m asl in the Alps (von Lehmann and Sägesser 1986) and Pyrenees (González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>In southern Europe there are two subspecies with relatively restricted ranges. <em>C. c. italicus</em> occurs in central and southern Italy, between southern Tuscany, Latium and Puglia, to Calabria (Lorenzini <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Randi <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006). <em>C. c. garganta</em> occurs in southern Iberia, in particular in Andalusia (Sierra de Cádiz) (Lorenzini <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006, Lorenzini <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).","With the exception of some small populations in the southern part of its range, the extensive hunting of this species is sustainable.",Terrestrial,"The species is listed on the Bern Convention (Appendix III), and occurs in a large number of protected areas across its range. In general, this species can quickly re-build its numbers and may tolerate a relatively high hunting pressure, if in a suitable habitat and under an appropriate hunting regime. Management operations, such as re-introductions, restocking and translocations, have been carried out widely across its range, and should always be carried out using the appropriate genotypes.<br/><br/>To protect remnant populations of the Italian Roe Deer <em>Capreolus c. italicus</em>, Lorenzini <em>et al.</em> (2002) and Mucci <em>et al.</em> 2012 recommended the following measures: (1) Identify and map the extant populations of Italian Roe Deer, with indications of their genetic purity through reliable molecular protocols, (3) Prohibit translocations of Roe Deer from northern stocks to central and southern Italy, and <em>vice versa</em>, (4) Facilitate the expansion of remaining populations through habitat improvements, and (5) Establish a re-introduction plan for southern Italy, where uncontaminated and isolated areas are identified to prevent introgressive hybridization with the European subspecies.

22167140,29742,Rangifer tarandus,Vulnerable,A2a,2016,2015-12-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"In 2015, <em>Rangifer </em>tarandus is categorized as Vulnerable A2a due to an observed 40% decline over three generations (about 21-27 years) across the circum-Arctic countries, when <em>Rangifer </em>declined from about 4,800,000 to 2,890,410 individuals. Uncertainty is high about the extent of the decline and the under-lying mechanisms except at a general level. Extent and causes of the decline vary with region and subspecies. Causes of declines include habitat changes, which do not appear reversible within three generations. <br/><br/>The species is largely migratory and gregarious and is thus susceptible to declines as a result of landscape changes, including the establishment of barriers (related to human activities and infrastructure development), which can disrupt migration routes and destroy seasonal habitat. Unregulated hunting, time lags in management and habitat alteration leading to habitat loss, fragmentation, and changes in predation are mechanisms for declines. Furthermore a warming climate will have complex and interacting effects and concerns are strong about a warmer climate exacerbating effects of disease and parasites including the possibility of epidemics. Additionally, despite monitoring, uncertainty remains about abundance and trends as well as trends in habitat loss which suggests the observed declines in <em>Rangifer </em>abundance and habitat may continue over a further three generations.","<em>Rangifer </em>occupy a number of habitats from continental coastal plains to mountain ranges and Arctic islands, spanning high Arctic to Boreal forest. The Arctic island tundra habitats include high Arctic polar desert to semi-moist dwarf shrub tundra. The low-lying coastal plains on continental North America and Russia vary from narrow coastal strips of tundra to large low-lying extent of tussock and non-tussock graminoid tundra. The tree line transition zone also varies in width depending on elevation and climate and separates the tundra from the Boreal forests. In mountainous regions, elevation determines the level of the tree line and the transition between coniferous forest and montane tundra. Along the rugged southwestern coast of Greenland, the tundra is a relatively narrow vegetated band separated by deep fiords or glaciers reaching the coast. <br/><br/><em>Rangifer </em>is a generalist herbivore with a diet dominated by lichens, forbs, sedges, grasses and shrubs. Foraging is seasonally selective and focused on individual plant species and selecting flower buds and unfolding leaves to maximize nutritional value (Russell <em>et al.</em> 1993). Winter diet is often largely lichens, which may occur as thick mats in many boreal coniferous forests. <em>Rangifer </em>is unusual among large-bodied herbivores as it can exploit lichens which, although high in digestible carbohydrates, are low in protein (Russell <em>et al.</em> 1993). Lichens are slow-growing and are periodically unavailable for decades after fires sweep through the forests. Caribou tend to avoid burnt areas preferring the forests 150 to 250 years after fires (Thomas <em>et al.</em> 1998). <br/><br/><strong>Life History</strong><br/>Adult survival is typically high (80-90%), while calf survival is annually variable. The annual life-cycle starts with the cows being bred in the fall rut (September-October) and then calving in June after a gestation averaging 225–235 days (Bergerud 1975). The cow’s autumn body condition determines the age of first pregnancy and the annual likelihood that a cow will conceive. Barren-ground Caribou usually calve at 3 years of age and usually calve annually but reproductive pauses occur if a cow has not regained sufficient fat and protein reserves by the rut and thus does not conceive (Cameron 1994, Thomas and Kiliaan 1998). The climate across <em>Rangifer </em>distribution is highly seasonal, is characterized by a short snow-free plant growing season and a long winter when snow often adds to the energetic costs of moving and foraging. Climate is strongly regional and trends in climate differ across the regions (Whitfield and Russell 2005). Correspondingly, <em>Rangifer </em>have a strongly seasonal cycle of accumulating fat and protein reserves which are high prior to the rut and lowest during calving (females) and after the rut (males).<br/><br/>Caribou are relatively long-lived, with females living as long as 12–16 years, and males for a few years less (Thomas and Killiaan 1998). Single births are usual (Thomas and Killiaan 1998). The calf is able to stand within a few minutes of birth and in two to three days can keep pace with the maternal cow. Generation time, used in species assessments, is estimated at 8-9 years based on barren-ground Caribou adult survival and fecundity.<br/><br/><strong>Breeding Strategy</strong><br/>The sexes differ in body size, breeding pelage and antler size. <em>Rangifer </em>is polygynous (a male mates with more than one female) and the breeding system is thought to be a harem system. Cows have several oestrus cycles of 10-12 days (Ropstad 2000) and conceptions are highly synchronous within a herd during the four- to five-week mating season (Dauphiné and McClure 1974). Less information is recorded about the rut strategies of the forest-dwelling <em>Rangifer </em>(caribou and valentinae). Female reproductive strategies are relatively flexible with the cows trading off their survival against reproductive investment during conception, foetal growth (birth mass) or lactation. The strategy is an adaption to annual variations in energetic costs and the availability of forage. <br/><br/><strong>Movement Patterns</strong> <br/><em>Rangifer </em>characteristically is a constant migrant, the migrations from winter to calving and post-calving ranges and then from fall to winter ranges are a striking global phenomena. Migratory behavior is associated with gregariousness. Although the highly gregarious nature of the tundra herds is conspicuous, forest Reindeer is also gregarious although the numbers are less. In Finland, forest Reindeer during calving are dispersed but the Reindeer is gregarious during the rut and into winter (Miettunen 2014).<br/><br/>Abundance influences the scale of seasonal movements: when abundance is high, migration distances can be long (thousands of kms) from wintering deep in the boreal forests to calving and summering on the tundra. For some herds, calving and summer range is an Arctic island and the winter range is the neighboring continental mainland (Poole <em>et al.</em> 2010, Baskin 2005). Geographic fidelity to calving and summer ranges tends to be high both in migratory tundra Caribou and forest Reindeer (Pulliainen <em>et al.</em> 1986). When abundance is low, fall and winter ranges most often contract toward the calving and summer ranges and the length of the migration pathways is correspondingly reduced, often by hundreds of kilometres. On the arctic islands, when abundance is low, Caribou are dispersed in individual home ranges, as abundance increases, seasonal migrations increase in distance and the degree of gregariousness (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Mountain Caribou rely on migrating between lowland winter ranges to high elevation calving and summer ranges on the alpine tundra. Forest (and woodland Caribou) Reindeer are dispersed at low densities and undertake relatively small-scale seasonal migrations with selecting calving areas in boggy areas on small islands in lakes. In Greenland with its narrow coastal strip of ice-free land that is dominated by fiords and mountains, movement is restricted and generally oriented on an east-west axis.","For mountain and forest <em>Rangifer</em>, landscape changes from forestry and industrial developments especially roads and seismic lines lead to changes in vegetation and vulnerability to predation (Leblond <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Johnson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). However, despite knowing the relationship between landscape changes and predation, management is not yet effective, as declines of boreal Caribou have continued (COSEWIC 2014, Johnson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Landscape changes, especially transportation infrastructures, energy production plants and tourist resorts, often represent barriers for migrations, and are responsible for Reindeer population fragmentation in Norway (Panzacchi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a,b; 2015). Some landscape changes, include mining about which concerns are locally strong, include dust and cumulative effects. Less is known about population versus individual responses to industrial development. An exception is the Central Arctic Herd in Alaska. The western part of the calving ground has been intensively developed as oilfields with networks of roads, pipelines and drill pads. Calf body mass and survival was affected by this development (Arthur and Del Vecchio 2009), but initially the herd increased partly as a result of a trade-off between development costs in better regulated hunting.<br/><br/>Unregulated hunting and competition with domesticated Reindeer are documented threats for continental tundra Reindeer (Baskin 2005). However, mechanisms underlying widespread declines are incompletely understood, especially the role of predation, nutrition, disease and parasite interactions. <em>Rangifer </em>have been harvested for thousands of years and harvest is a part of the life and culture of northern aboriginal people. But, technology has changed hunting effort which is often uncoupled from <em>Rangifer </em>abundance leading to delays in detecting effects of unsustainable hunting. The conditions when, and if, harvesting becomes a threat are complex and although <em>Rangifer </em>is subject to management planning, the realities are that management responses are frequently hampered by mistrust of scientific data, disagreements about causes of declines, and time lags in institutional responses to implement management actions (Kolpaschikov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). <br/><br/>Climate change is rapid in the Arctic and its effects will be complex as relative and absolute forage availability changes, the timing of snow melt, ice freeze-up and break-up changes. A detrimental effect that can change the context of other threats is changes in the frequency of rain-on-snow or other icing events (Hansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, 2014) especially on the Arctic islands. Icing events can cause widespread changes in movements and deaths especially of calves and adult bulls. A warmer climate will have complex effects on parasites (Kutz <em>et al.</em> 2014) as some are adapted to a cool climate and their development may be reduced in warmer temperatures (Hoar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Warmer temperatures will change the distribution of intermediate hosts and vectors such as mosquitoes. In Finland, recent warmer summers increased mosquito activity leading to outbreaks of Setaria in Finnish Reindeer, causing many deaths (Laaksonen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).","Overall across the circum-arctic countries, the trend is an inferred 40% decline over the previous 10-25 years, when <em>Rangifer </em>declined from about 4,800,000 to 2,890,410. There are national, but no global, databases to assess conservation status, although the Circum-Arctic Rangifer Assessment Monitoring and Assessment (CARMA) network tracks trends in migratory tundra <em>Rangifer</em>. For this IUCN assessment, we used data from journal publications, web sites, published and unpublished reports and expert knowledge. We did not use in-filling methods to bring estimates to the same reporting period as survey methodologies varied from expert opinion to ground and aerial survey-based estimates. Consequently, abundance estimates have variable measurement error (as described by, for example Baskin 2005, Cuyler 2007, Bjerketvedt <em>et al.</em> 2014). Estimates of abundance vary as to whether adults only are reported. Estimating population size is often infrequent which influences describing trends over 3 generations (21-27 years) and we were occasionally limited to assessing trend over 10 years. Generation time is estimated at 7-9 years based on barren-ground Caribou adult survival and fecundity as input to the IUCN generation length calculation which uses mean survival values (generation length = (1/mortality rate) + age at first reproduction). For subpopulations with adult survival data, a similar range of values is calculated. However, calculation of generation time is complicated (Hernandez-Suarez 2011), as it depends on the population age structure and average age.<br/><br/>As well as the 40% overall decline during the past 10-30 years, the abundance of wild Reindeer and Caribou has declined since historic times (Bergerud 1974, Syroechkovski 2000, Festa-Bianchet <em>et al.</em> 2011) especially for forest and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. In Russia, in the late 1800s, there may have been 5 million Caribou which rapidly declined to about 600,000 by about 1900 and 250,000 by the 1960s before recovering to peak in the 1990s (T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). For the continental tundra <em>Rangifer</em>, any question of historic declines is complicated by the longer-term (decadal) cycles in abundance (Meldgaard 1986, Zalatan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Joly <em>et al.</em> 2011). Generally, many continental tundra herds peaked in the 1990s then declined. The current declines are less than historic minimums for several Canadian continental tundra populations despite management actions such as hunting restrictions. In Norway, abundance has recovered since hunting caused historic declines until hunting was halted in 1902-06. However, it is uncertain if the current declines are less or similar to the historic levels. <br/><br/>Typically, declining abundance and distribution can fragment populations. However, trends in numbers of <em>Rangifer </em>populations are complicated as their definitions are not standardized. While populations (herds) are relatively easily recognized from calving and post-calving to rut movements for continental tundra and mountain Caribou, terminology is more problematic for forest Reindeer and boreal Caribou. Additionally, fragmentation and introductions have altered population numbers so any relationship between overall declines and numbers of populations is unclear. Three examples reveal the complexity. Firstly, in Norway, the two or three large historic sub-populations of mountain reindeer historically declined by the early 1900s and recovered but into a landscape increasingly fragmented by roads, railways, energy production plants and tourist resorts. The developments blocked ancient migration routes (Panzacchi <em>et al.</em> 2013a) and the former two or three populations became fragmented. <br/><br/>The second example of complexity in interpretation for trends in populations is on Canada’s island of Newfoundland, 12 natural populations were the basis for an additional 20 introduced populations (COSEWIC 2014). The third example, is in Alaska, during peak numbers, two small mountain herds ‘disappeared’ when a larger and increasing neighboring herd expanded their range and overlapped the smaller herd’s range (Harper 2013). The larger migratory tundra populations mostly persist for decades, even as their abundances increases and decreases (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/><strong>Alaska</strong>: Overall, the total number in 27 herds for coastal tundra and mountain Caribou (Harper 2013) have declined about 40% in abundance from approximately 1.1 million Caribou at the peak of herd sizes (1994±2.3SE) to 660,000 (2010±0.03SE). Currently, most (20) herds are 2,500 Caribou or less while the other 7 herds are 30,000 or more. Six of the smaller herds may have increased but uncertainty remains about the earlier estimates, three of the larger mountain herds have increased (with predator and hunting management) while three of four coastal tundra herds are declining. Most monitoring is annual for survival and productivity and frequent estimates of herd size for the larger herds. <br/><br/><strong>Canada</strong>: Overall, Caribou have declined in abundance over three generations by an average of 52% to the current (2015) estimated 1.3 million Caribou. The decline is unevenly distributed among the different types of Caribou. Monitoring boreal Caribou is mostly dependent on monitoring mortality and productivity while population abundance is directly estimated for mountain and migratory tundra caribou from sample counts during calving, post-calving or fall. However, the frequency of monitoring varies considerably. <br/><br/>Boreal Caribou have continued to decline since 2002 despite conservation efforts to mitigate the cumulative impacts of oil and gas development, forestry, and other land use activities. For 37 of 52 boreal subpopulations where trend data are available, 81% are in decline. Population surveys prior to 2002 estimated that there are 33,000 forest-dwelling caribou in the boreal population and in 2014, an ongoing decline of &gt;30% of the boreal Caribou is inferred. <br/><br/>Caribou on the island of Newfoundland declined by 68% since 2002 for the 15 natural and 22 introduced local populations. A remnant of the former southern extent of Caribou in Canada’s southeast, the Gaspésie Caribou declined further since 1950 to about 120 adults despite being in a national park and predator removal. <br/><br/>Overall for mountain Caribou, status is uncertain as trend is measured for 18 of 45 sub-populations over the last 5 years representing approximately 54% of the current population, 9 are declining and only two are increasing. Of concern is that 26 herds are &lt;500 individuals, 13 are &lt;250 and two have disappeared (COSEWIC 2014). <br/><br/>On Canada’s arctic islands, the overall trend for Peary Caribou, <em>R. t. pearyi</em>, is a decline to about 14,000 individuals by 2014 from 22,000 estimated in 1987. Historically, Peary Caribou abundance was higher being an estimated 25,845 for the High Arctic Islands in 1961 and about 18,000 for the mid-arctic islands in 1973-1980 but infrequent monitoring impedes assessing total numbers (COSEWIC 2004, SARC 2012). Peary Caribou occur as 4 populations (island groupings) one of which has essentially disappeared since the 1980s, one has declined and stabilized at low numbers while the north-western island grouping has been through two sharp declines followed by recovery. The trend for the northeastern and southeastern populations is uncertain given a low frequency of abundance estimates. An additional type of Caribou is Dolphin and Union (<em>R.t. groenlandicus </em>x<em> pearyi</em>) on the large mid-arctic island of Victoria. The population has not recovered to the abundance recorded in the early 1900s. Currently the population is stable or declining at 27,000 between 1997 and 2007 (SARC 2013, Dumond and Lee 2013). <br/><br/>Sixty percent of Canadian Caribou are barren-ground Caribou which in 2013, numbered an estimated 729,000 individuals in possibly 11 subpopulations. Six populations are regularly monitored. Since the peak in the mid-1990s, the overall decline has been approximately 45-50%, with six subpopulations having declined by 70-98% from peak populations in the mid-1990s. Caribou on Baffin Island declined from over 100,000 to about 5,000 and for the Bathurst herd in the central Arctic Canada, the decline was from 460,000 in 1986 to about 20,000 in 2015 with the decline accelerating in the later stages (SARC 2013, CBC 2015) Two of the largest herds of migratory Caribou are the woodland Caribou sub-species although they are strongly migratory with aggregated calving. The George River declined from a peak abundance of 776,000 in 1993 to 14,200 in 2014 while the Leaf River peaked at 638,000 in 2001 and had declined 32% to 430,000 by 2011 (S. Coté pers. comm. 2014) <br/><br/><strong>Greenland</strong>: <br/>The overall trend for Caribou on Greenland’s west coast for 2004-2015 is an approximate 30% decline and, conservatively, the total number of Caribou in 2015 is about 73,430 excluding three populations with feral Reindeer mixed with the Caribou (Cuyler 2004, 2015). Caribou abundance is cyclic with two cycles since 1721 with short-lived peak abundance, rapid decline and extended periods of scarcity that may last a century or more before numbers recover (Cuyler <em>et al.</em> 2011). The most recent peak may have occurred in the late 1990s but changes in census techniques obscure trends (Cuyler <em>et al.</em> 2011, Cuyler unpublished). Possible causes of the previous abrupt declines include severe weather involving the entire coast in combination with overgrazed ranges, and possibly, hunting (C. Cuyler pers. comm.). Although only the four largest populations are monitored for abundance through aerial surveys, all 11 sub-populations have annual harvest monitoring (Cuyler 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Norway</strong>: There are approximately 6,000 wild Reindeer in four populations restricted to the mountains of southern Norway (Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012, O. Strand pers. comm.). Their numbers over three generations are relatively stable based on 3 of the 4 populations which are regularly monitored through minimum counts. Also in the mountains of Norway are another 8 populations which were previously mixed with semi-domesticated reindeer and 11 populations which originated from releases of semi-domesticated reindeer (Reimers 2007, Røed 2005, Røed <em>et al.</em> 2014). The behavior and reproduction performance of the reindeer is influenced by the semi-domesticated reindeer (Reimers <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2014). Overall, the trend for all 23 populations is increasing to stable under a regulated hunting regime. In 2002, the estimated total number for all populations was 22,000-29,000 and in 2015, 33,560-34,360 (O. Strand pers. comm., Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, the populations that have been mixed with semi-domesticated reindeer and which originated from the release of semi-domesticated reindeer have not been included in the calculations of population size (nationally or globally) for this re-assessment.<br/><br/>Svalbard Reindeer <em>R. t. platyrynchus</em> numbered 10,100 individuals in 2009 (Sysselmannen på Svalbard 2009), an increase since the early 1900s. The Reindeer were hunted for 100s of years but the introduction of firearms and commercial hunting in the 1860s led to reduced numbers and local extinctions. Hunting was halted in 1925. The extent that current abundance and distribution have returned to historic levels is not reported. Recent trends are available for three of the 13 populations (Adventdalen, Reindalen ,Brøggerhalvøya) as their distribution is restricted by glaciers to peninsulas and coastal lowlands. The trend is a 65% increase in the three populations from 1,217 in 1985 to 1,871 in 2012. A fourth herd, Edgeøya (northeastern Svalbard) was last counted in 2006 (Reimers 2012) and was considered stable or decreasing (Aanes <em>et al.</em> 2003, Reimers 2012). <br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Finland</strong>: Forest Reindeer are remnant of their former numbers and distribution as the Reindeer disappeared from across central and southern Finland in the early 1900s, but re-colonized from neighboring Russia in the 1940s (http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en). Numbers increased from 1992-2001 when 1,700 forest Reindeer were counted in Kainuu, eastern Finland but subsequently declined to 800 individuals by 2014. A second Finnish population started in 1984, when 10 forest Reindeer from Kainuu were released at Suomenselkä, central Finland and increased to about 1,100 in 2014 (Miettunen 2015). The decline in Kainuu’s wild forest Reindeer since 2001 seems to have been caused by higher calf mortality from increasing numbers of wolves (Kojola <em>et al.</em> 2004), traffic accidents and movements into Russia. <br/><br/><strong>Russia</strong>: Overall, abundance in Russia has declined 21% since 1990 compared to 2015 and the recorded abundance declined from 1,050,600 to 831,500 (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). The situation is quite different from North America as there are high numbers of domesticated Reindeer. The effect of domesticated Reindeer includes increased predator control as well as poaching and loss of the domesticated Reindeer to the wild Reindeer herds (Baskin 2005, Klokov 2004, Syroechkovski 2000).<br/><br/>Historically, wild Reindeer decreased since the mid-1800s to the early 1900s from as many as 5 million to less than 1 million. Abundance fluctuated during the 20th century with a peak in the early 1990s, then abundance declined. The declines in Reindeer number were mainly connected with social and economic changes in Russia. Regional status is variable and 23 populations or regions are listed in regional red books between 2001 and 2015 as being reduced to low numbers or declining (I. Mizin pers. comm. 2015). <br/><br/>Russia has a high diversity of wild Reindeer sub-species and recent declines are especially apparent for island, forest and mountain Reindeer. One population (Nizhny Novgorod) has disappeared and 19 populations are ranked as Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened. Currently forest and mountain Reindeer in the Russian Plains (Karelia, Arkhangelsk, Komi and Nenets Autonomous District) are all listed in the Red Books and have declined 64% in 1991-2015 from 35,400 to 12,800 individuals while their distribution is highly fragmented and reduced.<br/><br/>The sub-species <em>R. tarandus pearsoni</em> restricted to Novaya Zemlya Island has declined 30% to 5,000 individuals but Reindeer on the other Arctic islands have declined at a higher rate (73%) from 41,000 to 11,000 individuals between 1991 and 2015 (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). In eastern Russia, <em>R. tarandus phylarchus</em> in the forests on the Kamchatka Peninsula have declined since the 1950s (Mosolov 1996) and more recently, declined about 50% from 4,500 to 2,300 (1991-2015). In the Russian Far East and Pacific coast, mountain-tundra Reindeer are stable in trend but with a risk of fragmentation into small isolated populations. In southeastern Russia, <em>R. tarandus angustirostris</em> (transbaikal slender-snouted Reindeer) is a forest Reindeer and difficult to survey, but apparently reduced to several hundred animals. <br/><br/>The most numerous sub-species are the migratory tundra Reindeer (<em>R. t. sibiricus</em>) currently numbering 626,000 individuals (North Yukutia, Yamal, and Taimyr ) which have declined. The western Siberian tundra Reindeer (Yamal) have declined from 3,000 to 2,000 between 1991 and 2015 on ranges impacted by industrial development (I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). Uboni <em>et al.</em> (2015) report that Taimyr and North Yakutia (Yana-Indirka, and Sundrun) tundra Reindeer had peaked in the 1990s and then subsequently had declined 25% to 624,000 individuals, while the Lena-Olenek herd increased from 55,000 in 1985 to 90,000 in 2001. The population is heavily harvested at about 9,500-12,000 individuals per year (T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015). With the collapse of the domesticated reindeer industry in Chukotka in the 1980s and 1990s, the wild Reindeer in Chukotka increased rapidly from 33,000 in 1991 to 93,700 by 2015 (Klokov 2004, I. Mitzin and T. Sipko pers. comm. 2015)<br/><br/><strong>Mongolia</strong>: Trends in abundance are unreported (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006) for <em>R. t. valentinae</em> in northern Mongolia. The limited assessments indicate fewer than 1,000 wild reindeer (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006).",Decreasing,"<em>Rangifer </em>is widespread occurring between 50 and 81 degrees of latitude around the Arctic in the northwestern U.S., Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, Finland, Russia and Mongolia. The global distribution was expanded by introducing domesticated Reindeer which became feral to Iceland, and to islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean (Kerguelen, Falkland and until recently, South Georgia Island). Greenland, Finland, Mongolia, Norway and Russia also have domesticated Reindeer which have genetically and or demographically contributed to wild Reindeer populations (Røed 2005, Røed  <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, C. Cuyler pers. comm. 2015). Those populations which include domesticated Reindeer are not included in this assessment. <br/><br/>The geographic range has contracted and become fragmented during the previous hundred years mostly due to hunting and landscape changes with increased settlement, agriculture, forestry and the introduction of Reindeer herding. Analyses of current and historic distribution are available at national scales for some countries. By the early 1900s, forest Reindeer had disappeared from Finland (<a href=""http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en"">http://www.suomenpeura.fi/en</a>) although in the 1950s, a small area was re-colonized from neighbouring Russia. In Norway, the cumulative ranges have contracted to about half the size of the historic range (Lund 2004). Russian Reindeer distribution has contracted to the north and west and become fragmented over 85% its range (Syroechkovski 2000).<br/><br/>The Canadian geographic ranges of mountain and Boreal Caribou have contracted: over the last 150 years, Boreal Caribou have been extirpated from about half of their former range: approximately 60% in Alberta, 50% in Ontario, and 40% in British Columbia (Hummel and Ray 2008, COSEWIC 2014). In eastern Canada, the current Atlantic-Gaspésie population is the remnant of a larger distribution that included much of northeastern Canada and USA but which disappeared by the early 1900s (COSEWIC 2014). For mountain Caribou in BC, by 2002, 40% of their annual range had shrunk (COSEWIC 2014).<br/><br/>Less information has been compiled regarding changes in the current historic distribution for continental tundra Caribou, and is complicated by the 40-60 year cycles of abundance with contractions and expansions of distribution. Historic declines in Alaska of the Fortymile herd between the 1920s and 1970s, led to a contraction of range size of 25%. The risk is that contraction of the historic range is relatively poorly documented and consequently the current distribution is considered ‘normal’, this could be considered an example of a shifting baseline (Pauly 1995).",Local meat consumption and hide use; some commercial use antlers.,Terrestrial,"Most <em>Rangifer </em>herds are within management or conservation plans, and the conservation status of most subspecies and populations are nationally assessed. The ratings for conservation status (nationally rated as endangered, threatened or special concern) based on designated units (Canada) or oblasts (regions in Russia) emphasize the vulnerability of woodland and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. Only 4% of continental tundra <em>Rangifer </em>and 12% of Arctic Island are included in conservation categories compared to 84% of mountain and forest Caribou. In Russia, wild Reindeer are assessed and listed by conservation status in regional Red Books. The national Committee On the Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC) has assessed or re-assessed almost all Caribou for their conservation status using similar criteria as the IUCN’s (COSEWIC 2014). The assessments lead to either recovery or special management planning which includes identification and protection of critical habitat. <br/><br/>Unlike many migratory species, <em>Rangifer </em>is not a recognized species within the Convention of Migratory Species probably because few migrations cross international boundaries. Two <em>Rangifer </em>populations annually range over international boundaries between Canada and the US (Selkirk Mountain Caribou and the Porcupine herd) and international cooperation is through agreements. In Finland, forest Reindeer are listed as Near Threatened under Appendix III (Protected fauna species) of the 1979 Bern Convention (The Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). The forest Reindeer in Finland seasonally move across the border with Russia and the degree of monitoring and cooperation is high (Miettunen 2015). In Norway, the 23 populations of Reindeer were collectively assessed as Least Concern in 2015 (<a href=""http://data.artsdatabanken.no/Rodliste"">http://data.artsdatabanken.no/Rodliste</a>). The US assigns Threatened status to the Selkirk Mountain Caribou although the herd is reduced to a few individuals.<br/><br/>Management systems are summarized in Klein (2005) and typically, their emphasis is on tracking population trends and vital rates and adjusting hunting for migratory tundra and mountain <em>Rangifer</em>. Although many herds are monitored, lags in management actions lead to accelerated declines especially where hunting effort through technological advances is uncoupled from trends in abundance (Kolpaschikov <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bjerketvedt <em>et al.</em> 2014, Strand <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Russia, socio-political factors have a greater effect than decadal climate patterns in shaping trends in abundance (Uboni <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Norway where the Reindeer ranges are increasingly modified, landscape management is becoming more important than reliance on harvest management (Kaltenborn <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Landscape management includes special use and protected areas and experience with their effectiveness varies. Despite progress, conservation planning has not reversed or even stemmed the landscape causes of declines (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ray <em>et al.</em> 2015). In some areas, hunting restrictions, population augmentation and predator management have taken precedence in areas where industrial land use changes continued unabated and this can lead to controversy (Brook <em>et al.</em> 2015). Protected areas such as national parks are not a complete answer to <em>Rangifer </em>conservation if they are accompanied by increasing tourism and recreational activities.<br/><br/><em>Rangifer </em>includes some of the globe’s largest and longest migrations with tens of thousands animals moving 100s of kilometres. Thus the effectiveness of protected areas in conservation will depend on planning a network of protection for annual ranges (Runge <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, current protected areas are at the scale of seasonal ranges rather than a network of land management or adequate protected areas to integrate conservation of seasonal ranges (Gunn <em>et al.</em> 2014). Emphasis for migratory tundra caribou has been on protecting calving grounds as in Canada where three national parks provide year-round protection for part of the calving grounds of five herds. In Russia, the Taimyrski zapovednik established a nature reserve in 1979 which covers about 6% of the Taimyr herd’s calving areas.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
44141588,41773,Sus celebensis,Near Threatened,A2cd,2020,2016-05-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Sus celebensis</em> is assessed as Near Threatened because this species is likely to be in significant decline (but probably at a rate of less than 30% over three generations [18 years]). This decline continues at a similar rate as at the previous assessment (2008). Declines are due to widespread over-hunting and habitat loss through much of its range. The species may be close to qualifying for Vulnerable under criterion A2cd, though this is difficult to determine with current information.","Sulawesi Warty Pigs are reported to occur in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from rainforest and swamp, to open grasslands and agricultural areas, and at all altitudes up to moss forest (&gt;2,500 m) (MacKinnon 1981), though they are less common at altitudes above 1,500 m asl (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2009). They usually live in groups of from one to six animals, but the social composition of these groups is incompletely known (Macdonald 1991, Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 1996). In Tanjung Peropa Nature Reserve sex ratio of adult was found to be 1:1.25 (n=25), and group size varies between two to nine animals with an average of five individuals (n=16). The group generally was composed of 1-3 young, 1-2 sub adult, and 1-3 adults (Jamaludin <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><em>Sus celebensis</em> is an omnivore, with a wide-ranging diet reported (National Research Council 1983, Mustari 2005). They forage during the day, this activity being concentrated in the early morning and evening. Although roots, fallen fruit, leaves and young shoots constitute the bulk of their diet, invertebrates, small vertebrates and carrion are also eaten (Mustari <em>et al</em>. in prep).<br/><br/>There is little known about reproduction of <em>S. celebensis</em>. A pregnant sow reported from south Sulawesi by Sody (1941) was probably mated in February. Births can occur at any time throughout the year but sows usually have their young in April or May (National Research Council 1983). Gestation length is not known for certain, and the suggestion that it may lie between 16 and 20 weeks should be treated with the caution implied by Sody (1941). Litter size ranges from 2-8 (National research Council 1983), but a recent study in North Sulawesi found six pregnant sows killed by hunters to be carrying only 1-3 fetuses with a mean of only 2.17 fetuses per pregnancy (Budiarso <em>et al</em>. 1991).","Hunting is likely to be a significant factor impacting on population numbers of this species. Much information has been reported on this from north Sulawesi in the past 20 years, and more recent information is showing both trade from other regions of Sulawesi to the north is increasing, as well as local consumption within the other regions of Sulawesi. The high volume of trade in this species raises concerns about the sustainability of this current harvesting rate. Completion of the Trans-Sulawesi Highway (1980) probably increased consumption of wildlife within and importation into North Sulawesi from the rest of the island. Data was collected from market surveys from north-east Sulawesi and road blocks on the Trans-Sulawesi Highway (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2005). In the study it was noted that ‘trade in the Sulawesi pig is alarmingly high for such a large-bodied animal’. They observed an average of ~8 individuals per hour during road blockades (29.6% of 6963 wild animals recorded). Warty Pigs also accounted for 7% of all market encounters. Local consumption is also occurring in other regions of Sulawesi. For example, in south-east Sulawesi in an area neighbouring the northern part of Rawa Aopa Watumohai National Park, 1-2 pigs were caught daily for local consumption and transported from the forest by motorcycle.<br/><br/>What may be more alarming for the future of this species is the discovery that commercial hunting now encompasses the whole region. For example, 250 pigs found in a single truck were being transported from Buton Island (1,270 km away), in south-east Sulawesi (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2005). In a different area of south-east Sulawesi, called Kasipute Bombana, transportation of 100-150 individual occurs every two months to the north, and this can increase to 100-250 individuals being transported per month during peak hunting months (ISR pers. comm). Of the total number of pigs recorded during road blockades in north-east Sulawesi 36.8% were reported to have come from central Sulawesi and 11.4% from south-east Sulawesi (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2005). A model was used to predict the effect of hunting levels and the cost effectiveness of this trade for Sulawesi pigs in northern peninsula of Sulawesi. The likely outcome of trade in the Warty Pig is that the population will stabilise at around 37% of the unexploited size (Clayton <em>et al</em>. 2000). It remains unclear if these small isolated populations will be of sufficient size to maintain their genetic viability in the long-term.<br/><br/>The motivation for eating wild pig meat may be quite varied between regions of Sulawesi. In north Sulawesi, the Minahasa people consider wild pig meat to be superior to domestic pork, and are willing to pay 20% to 50% more for it. Whereas, in Toraja South Sulawesi, domesticated pig meat is preferred to wild meat, though they eat the wild pig. Demand for wild pig meat varies through the year in north Sulawesi. Usually the demand of the species will be increase at the time of ceremonies, which are usually from July to October, and also around Christmas and New Year. Hunting also occurs for protection of crops by local communities.<br/><br/>Within protected areas the species is technically protected by law, though it was certainly hunted in some of these areas (Setyodirwiryo 1959, Smiet 1982, Blouch 1990, JB pers. obs). Reports have increased our knowledge on the distribution and numbers of <em>S. celebensis</em> on Sulawesi and neighbouring islands (Avalard 2000, Riley 2000). This has shown that pig densities have declined in areas of high hunting pressure such as Lore Lindu, Bogani Nani-Wartabone (Riley 2000), Rawa Aopa Watumohai, Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Parks, and conservation areas in northern tip of Sulawesi.<br/><br/>Another potential threat to <em>S. celebensis</em> is genetic contamination through breeding with feral or domesticated <em>S. scrofa</em>. The latter species is kept for protein production in some communities in different parts of Sulawesi.<br/><br/>There is no significant predator of this species, though it is possible that young individuals may be taken by pythons (<em>Python reticulates</em>) or crocodiles (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>).","<em>Sus celebensis</em> is likely to occur in all of the principal national parks, nature and game reserves in their range, except those in north-east and south-west of Sulawesi. Those where significant populations of Warty Pigs are found include Lore Lindu (2,310 km²), Bogani Nani-Wartabone (2,871 km²), Morowali (2,250 km²), Rawa Aopa Watumohai (1,051 km²) and many other smaller conservation areas (Riley 2002; Wiles <em>et al</em>. 2002; Burton and Macdonald 2006, 2009).<br/><br/><em>Sus celebensis</em> is probably in significant decline (but probably at a rate of less than 30% over ten years). The reasons for this decline are varied. Firstly, deforestation for timber and conversion of land for agriculture, coupled with human population expansion and immigration have resulted in a marked contraction of the natural habitat of this species. However, this species does survive in disturbed habitats, so the impact of habitat change is difficult to determine.<br/><br/>An island wide survey (Riley 2002) found no records of pigs in three areas in the north east peninsula of Sulawesi, and low densities in the central region of the island. Populations in both these regions appear to have been affected by demand for pig meat in Minahasa and Palu areas, respectively. While the south-east area had the highest population densities, the demand for pig meat locally was lowest. Densities ranged from 0.4-2.0 animals/km² (Panua Nature Reserve) in the north peninsula to 5.1-14.5 animals/km² (Tanjung Peropa Nature Reserve) in the south-east peninsula. A recent study in the latter site found densities in lowland forest to be 23.5 animals/km² (Jamaludin <em>et al</em>. 2009). This data highlights the increasing pressure from hunting on the pigs of Sulawesi, as reported elsewhere (Clayton <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2000; Lee <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The population densities of Sulawesi Warty Pig in lowland forest of south-east peninsula in Tanjung Amolengo Wildlife Reserve was from 7.8-26.4 per km² (Mustari 2009).&#160; Meanwhile in Tanjung Peropa Nature Reserve the densities was found to be 5.1-14.5 animals per km² by Riley (2002), and Mustari estimated densities to range between 3.8-8.4 individuals per km² (2009). In the northern peninsula at Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve the population density was reported by O’Brien and Kinaird (1996) to be 12 pigs per km². Also in north Sulawesi, in the Manembo-nembo area, Lee (2000) estimated densities of 5.1 individuals per km². Alvard (2000) reported in Morowali Nature Reserve the population density of the Warty Pigs of about 1.54 individuals per km². The range of individuals was estimated to be between 0.4-2.0 animals per km² in Panua Nature Reserve (Riley 2002). These data highlight the increasing pressure from hunting on the pigs of Sulawesi, as reported elsewhere especially in northern part of the island (Clayton <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2000; Lee <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Decreasing,"<em>Sus celebensis</em> is a medium sized pig which is still found in abundance in central, east and south-east Sulawesi. It is now scarce in south and north-east Sulawesi and may be extinct on nearby Selayar Island. It also occurs as a native form on the adjacent islands of Buton, Muna, Kabeana, Peleng, Lembeh and on some of the Togian Islands (Burton and Macdonald 2006). As originally shown by Groves (1981), this species has also been truly domesticated and widely transported to other islands, where it has also often hybridized with <em>S. scrofa</em>, thus giving rise to a variety of introduced domestic and feral pig populations amongst the Indonesian the islands of Flores, Timor, Simeuleu, Seram, Buru and Nias Islands. Domesticated forms of <em>S. celebensis</em> can be seen on the islands of Roti and Sawu (Groves 1983, Bell 1987). Wild pigs from Halmahera, previously referred to as feral <em>S. celebensis</em>, have been shown to have greater genetic affinity to the New Guinea pigs (Larson <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><p><em>Sus celebensis</em> is still found in abundance in central, east and south-east Sulawesi. Available evidence suggests that the species formerly occurred throughout Sulawesi, as well as on the neighboring islands of Selayar, Buton, Muna, Kabeana, Peleng, Lembeh and the Togian Islands (MacKinnon 1981, Wiles <em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, Macdonald <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). By the early 1980s it was reported that this species was greatly reduced in population numbers in south-west Sulawesi, and in nearby Selayar Island, following the virtual deforestation of these areas changed into agriculture and human settlements (MacKinnon 1981, National Research Council 1983).</p><p>In 2002, an island wide survey found a pattern of a patchy species distribution throughout Sulawesi Island. There were no records of pigs in three areas in the north east peninsula, and low densities in the central region of the island. Populations in both these regions appear to have been affected by demand for pig meat in Minahasa and Palu areas, respectively (Riley 2002). </p>    <p>The species has also been introduced elsewhere in Indonesia, e.g. to the islands of Flores, Timor, Lendu and Simeulue. The wild pigs on some of these islands are strongly modified and there is now little doubt that <em>S. celebensis</em> has been domesticated, and transported to these areas as a domestic or feral form, probably during the early migrations of peoples. Animals thought to be on <em>S. celebensis</em> origin were reported from the islands of Roti and Sawu (Groves, 1983; Bell, 1987). Hybridized forms of <em>S. celebensis</em> with <em>S. scrofa</em> forms were reported to survive on a number of islands in this region, including Salawatti, Great Kei Island, Dobu, Seram, Ambon, Bacan, Ternate, Morotai and New Guinea (Groves 1981, 1983; Oliver and Brisbin 1993). Genetic information on wild pigs from Halmahera, previously referred to as feral <em>S. celebensis,</em> has shown that they have greater genetic affinity to the New Guinea pigs. mtDNA sequences showed that the New Guinea pigs had haplotypes that clustered with pigs from Halmahera, Hawaii and Vanuwatu and were found in the “Pacific clade” (Larson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). This rules out a significant <em>S. celebensis</em> maternal input as previously proposed (Groves 1981). Feral <em>S. celebensis</em> have been reported from Flores, Timor, Lendu and Simeulue and Nias islands (Groves 1981), and this has been confirmed by mtDNA sequences for Flores (Dobney <em>et al.</em> 2008), but for the other islands this now needs to be reassessed.</p>","<em>Sus celebensis</em> is hunted and traded within Sulawesi on an increasingly large scale. This is for local consumption and also for trade across the island&#160;(Lee <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, J. Burton pers. obs.).",Terrestrial,"The species occurs in some protected areas. Those where significant populations of Warty Pigs are found include Lore Lindu (2,310 km²), Bogani Nani-Wartabone (2,871 km²), Morowali (2,250 km²) and many other smaller sites. Within all of these areas the species is technically fully protected by law. A Wildlife Crimes Unit Program was developed for wildlife trade monitoring and law enforcement in North Sulawesi. This has been active since 2001, however, overall trade in wild mammals has increased by 30% during this time, mainly from unprotected species (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2005). This Unit cannot control the levels of trade in the warty pig because hunting of this species is not prohibited outside of protected areas.

49239394,49182559,Larimichthys crocea,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2020,2016-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Larimichthys crocea</em>&#160;is found along the coast of China from the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and northern South China Sea.&#160;It is heavily fished throughout its range and has been heavily exploited since the 1950s and up until the 1980s, with serious declines in the 1970s and 1980s. The CPUE decreased by approximately 80% from the mid 1970s to the late 1980s in the northern South China Sea. There was a recorded total catch decline of over 90% in the East China Sea over the same time period. The catch numbers in Taiwan and Korea also declined by these high proportions. The numbers have not recovered since the crash in the 1980s despite restocking and management efforts such as spawning ground protection and nursery area protection. The generation length of this species is  approximately 15.5 years, and the declines in the global population are inferred to be approximately 80-95% (over three generation lengths ~47 years). As there is no evidence that this species is being sustainably exploited, it is listed as Critically Endangered under A2bd.","<em>Larimichthys crocea</em> inhabits coastal waters and estuaries and lives down to about 100 m; it is mostly found around 60 m depth over soft muddy, or sandy substrate. Adults and juveniles share the same habitats. It mainly feeds on benthic fishes and crustaceans.<br/><br/>This species forms spawning aggregations in shallow coastal waters (less than 30 m) in spring and/or autumn and gathered in offshore deeper waters (50-80 m) in winter as water temperatures in shallow waters decline (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Therefore, the species periodically moves between spawning and over-wintering grounds (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). About 9 spawning aggregation grounds were identified along the coastal waters of mainland China in the East and South China Seas. Along the coastal waters of mainland China from north to south, the main spawning season varied; in the north, spring was the main spawning season, and in the south it was autumn. The species has high fecundity with ripe females peaking at a GSI of 30% and the ability of a single female to produce millions of eggs in a spawning season. This species is reported to mature at around 22-25 cm SL (1950s) but more recently at&#160; &lt;20 cm SL (1980s). The maximum reported age for this species is&#160;29 years (1950s) and is more commonly reported from 5-12 year (1980/90s).&#160;<br/><br/>The sex ratio of this species shifted from 1:2 in 1960 to 1:1.&#160;In the survey of the Yellow Sea and the East Sea, the recorded length range was 30-200 mm, with an average of 97 mm.&#160;In China, the stock spawns mainly in spring but also during autumn.  The spawning grounds are generally located near the estuaries with a low salinity (27~31 ppt), with a 20 m depth and above, visibility no more than 1 m, flow rate no less than 1.2 m/s, and a temperature around 16~22℃. After spawning, the fish generally swim towards the outer sea to feed, and the juveniles move from shallow to deep water. With the lowering water temperature, adult fish and juvenile swim towards deep water (J.H. Cheng pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is about 15.5 years. This was calculated using the following equation: Age at first maturity + (max age - age at first maturity) / 2<br/><br/>Some studies showed there were some differences in morphological characteristics between the artificial cage-cultured population compared with wild population; the proportion of eye diameter to head length, as well as the proportion of body height to standard body length of cultured population are larger (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, the proportions of snout length to head length and postorbital length to head length of cage-cultured population are smaller than that of the wild population. Furthermore, the results showed that the proportions of eye diameter to head length, snout length to head length and head length to standard body length of cultured population decreased as the sizes of the standard body length increased. The regression equations of body length and weight, body length and culture period, can be indicated as W=0.0195L 2.9775 (R2=0. 9959), y=-0.0259x 2+1.7125x+4.1534(R2=0.989). The proportion of swim bladder weight to body weight is from 0.61% up to 2.26%, and the monthly average of swim bladder weight index is ranged from 1.08% to 1.85%.","<em>Larimichthys crocea </em>is&#160;heavily exploited throughout its range. Evidence strongly suggests that a combination of heavy exploitation of spawning and over-wintering aggregations, poor management, and over fishing pressure were major factors in stock declines, with contributions from pollution, habitat degradation and marine ecosystem shift (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Due to the rarity of the species in the wild in recent years, the prices of wild fish are much higher than those of maricultured fish in mainland China (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Mariculture of the species in mainland China is one of the most successful marine fishes; the mariculture production of the species remained at about 60 t in recent years (FAO dataset). Due to its longer life span and late sexual maturity, this fish has difficulty recovering after heavy exploitation. Wild stocks of the species showed low genetic diversity. The genetic diversity is even lower in maricultured fish. Prevention of the escape of maricultured fish and suspension of restocking programs are needed as these have facilitated inbred generations from hatcheries.<br/>&#160;  <br/>The prices of the species, wild-caught, were relatively cheap between the 1950s and the 1970s, and the species was one of the most common marine fishes consumed in mainland China. However, due to the rarity of the species in the wild in the recent years, the prices of wild fish are much higher, about 1000~1500 yuan per 500 g (USD 50-60 per kg) (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Due to the high demand and this species' inability to recover fast, it is over fishing that is its greatest threat.&#160;<br/><br/>The major threats to the species are over-exploitation of the spawning and over-wintering aggregations with excess catch volumes (i.e. far exceeded the estimated maximum sustainable yields) and efforts throughout its geographic region, including mainland China and South Korea between the 1950s and 1980s (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008).&#160;The species was heavily targeted by drag seine nets in all known spawning aggregation grounds, in shallow waters from the 1950s to 1970s and then shifted to trawling operations in over-wintering aggregation grounds in deeper waters in the 1970s and 1980s. These led to the complete disappearance of aggregations of the species in the late-1980s, particularly in the East China Sea.","In Japan, reported landings decreased from 1985 to present, with a increase in production from 2004-2011 (Japanese Fisheries Agency unpublished data). In mid-western Taiwan, monitoring data do not report this species since 2003 (M.-H. Chen pers. comm. 2016). In Fujian Province, mainland China, catches are very low in monitoring surveys since 2013 (M. Liu pers. comm. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Cheung and Pitcher (2008) showed the CPUE of&#160;<em>L. crocea</em>&#160;has declined about 80% from mid-1970s to late 80s in the northern South China Sea. This species has been heavily exploited since the 1950s, and wild stocks were severely depleted by the 1980s that most individuals subsequently sold had originated from hatcheries. After peaking at about 200,000t in the mid-1970s, catches of the croaker in China declined by over 90% within two decades.&#160;The population densities of the species in the geographic region are unknown. However, according to its capture volumes, the species was considerably abundant and common between the 1950s and 1970s, particularly in the East China Sea (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). <br/><br/>Mainland China accounted for about 90% of the global total capture volumes of the species from the 1950s to the 1970s, with catches mainly from the East China Sea (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008).  By the late 1980s, the crucial seasonal fishery of this species had completely disappeared throughout the region. Since the 1990s, the catch volumes have increased; however, the catch volumes are only derived from the capture reports from mainland China. The catches in South Korea have been no longer significant since the 1990s. The capture volume increase since the 1990s is probably over-reported (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). The wild stocks of the species have not recovered after various management measures, from protecting spawning and juvenile nursery grounds, long-term restocking, and developing hatchery-based mariculture.&#160;<br/><br/>The total catches (including the East and South China Seas, and the Yellow Sea) of the species from mainland China declined by 98% between 1974 (the peak year with about 200,000 t) and 1990 (less than 10 t). In the East China Sea, the catches declined by 99% during the same period (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008).&#160;The catches from mainland China and South Korea were mainly from both of the spawning aggregations formed by this species. Since the 1980s, the spawning aggregations have completely disappeared in all spawning grounds and the same applies for the over-wintering aggregations.<br/><br/>Several biological changes in the species have been identified and are probably associated with over exploitation in several heavily fished spawning grounds (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Age and size at sexual maturation at exploited spawning and over-wintering grounds declined between the 1950s and 1990s. The species grew faster (i.e. became longer and heavier at the same age) at heavily exploited spawning grounds as fishing pressure increased from the 1950s to 1980s. Genetic diversity in wild stocks was low.<br/><br/>The catch of Large Yellow Croaker in the East Sea accounted for more than 98% of the total catch until the 1980s. Before 1975, the catch of this species was about 19.6×10⁴t.  Because of the overfishing, the number of Large Yellow Croaker&#160;is much lower, and the stock has been damaged. In the 1990s, the average catches is about 0.9×10⁴t; in recent years, the annual catch is less than 1000t (J.H. Cheng pers comm. 2016) According to the large-scale research between 1997 and 2000, there are a few larger yellow croakers in the East China Sea, and there are more outside the Dasha fishing ground and the Wentai fishing ground. This species is rare in Taiwan.",Decreasing,"<em>Larimichthys crocea </em>is found along the coast of China from the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and northern South China Sea. It has also been reported off the southern tip of South Korea, along western Taiwan, and Hong Kong (K. Sasaki pers. comm. 2016). The depth range for this species is 10 to 100 m.","This is one of the most important stocks in China, and the main targeted stock in the East Sea and the South China Sea. There are various fishing methods such as trawl net, purse seine, drift nets, etc. As landings have declined historically, there has been increased effort to cultivate this species; upwards of 100,000 tonnes are now produced annually in mainland China (M. Liu pers. comm. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Large Yellow Croaker is nutrient-rich and has high economic value. There are dozens of cooking styles, including braising, stewed, fried and salted, etc.  Pickled large yellow croaker is one of the hospitality dishes for Zhoushan people. This species is also highly regarded for its traditional medical value.",Marine,"Various management measures have been applied to protect <em>L. crocea</em>&#160;in mainland China between the 1950s and 1980s, including fishing gear control, fishing effort input control, seasonal closure, spawning and juvenile nursery ground protection (see Table 2 in Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Despite the various management measures, the wild stocks of this species have not recovered, suggesting insufficient, inefficient, and untimely measures. <br/><br/>Large scale and long term restocking programs of the species have been applied in the East China Sea, mainland China from as soon as hatchery was successful in the 1980s (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson, 2008, and references cited). However, the wild stocks of the species did not show recovery in the East China Sea. Urgent research and conservation are needed for the species. The extensive Mainland China government-sponsored mariculture programs introduced to address food supply and over fishing in the 1980s, particularly of the croaker, was one of the earliest for marine fin fish, not only in China PR but globally. Although&#160;<em>L. crocea</em> proved a highly successful mariculture candidate, with approximately 70,000 tonnes produced in 2005, the highest of any marine fish cultured in China PR, mariculture and restocking have failed to restore croaker stocks and may have, inadvertently, led to biodiversity losses. The detailed history of the croaker is a sobering reminder that successful mariculture, albeit important for food production and livelihoods, is not necessarily a solution to over fishing, and moreover, may have compromised fishery recovery by competing for funds, attention, space, and maybe genetic resources (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). <br/>&#160;<br/>In China after the 1970s, because of the resources recession, the government and the fisheries management set many protection measures. For example, in 1981 fishing was prohibited between 5-7th in Lusi fishing ground (32-34°N, 122°30′) and trawling for Large Yellow Croaker was prohibited. Fujian Province has published the regulations for the feeding protection, prohibit fishing the Large Yellow Croaker&#160;in Guanjinyang spawning ground, and set up mobile and set-operation for fishing ban period of&#160; about 1-3 months. In the original Sino-Japanese Fishery Agreement, the original fish line has been extrapolated 30 miles, set up some protection, and between 4-6th fishing is prohibited. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian provinces prohibit fishing for 2-3 months in summer.  However, the effect is unsatisfactory (J.H. Cheng pers comm 2016).&#160;Zhejiang province has released artificial breeding individuals in Zhejiang coastal waters from 1998. During 1998-2003, the total number released is 623.6×10⁴, with 5-10 cm in length.","",,false,false,Global
54010576,54010476,Leopardus guttulus,Vulnerable,C1,2016,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Leopardus guttulus</em> has only recently been acknowledged as a valid species, separate from the former <em>Leopardus tigrinus</em>, due to their genetic uniqueness and differences (Trigo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a). Its current northern limits of geographic distribution are still unclear, but show a large extent of occurrence of <em>ca</em>. 3,287,075 km². However, its area of occupancy (AOO) is rather limited and within the threatened Cerrado and Atlantic Forest domains. Considering all available natural habitat in its entire range, the maximum AOO possible would be of only 473,254 km². Additionally, given the level of fragmentation and the very small size of some patches, it is very unlikely that the Southern Tiger Cat would be present in some parts of this remaining area. Besides, no single species occupies all natural areas within its geographic range. Therefore its actual AOO would be much lower than the estimates presented here. The species is almost always found at low/very low population densities (0.01–0.05/km² or lower), especially in protected areas, given the negative impact it suffers from Ocelots (‘ocelot effect’ – Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em> </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, most of the population probably occurs outside protected areas, in places under severe pressure from land development/habitat conversion. A population decline in the past few years has also been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, the estimated density dropped from 0.25/km<sup>2</sup> to 0.13/km<sup>2</sup> by almost 50% from 2005 to 2013/14, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013, Kasper<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2016, M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). If this decline continues, a population reduction of 80% would be expected in three generations (15 years) in this area. In another area the estimated density dropped by over 50% from 0.2/km<sup>2 </sup>to &lt;0.1/km<sup>2</sup> from 2008 to 2015, resulting in a population reduction of over 7%/year. If this decline continues, the population would disappear in 3 generations in this area. Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, MMA/IBAMA 2011). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012, R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comm.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between <em>L. guttulus</em> and <em>Leopardus geoffroyi</em> on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the southern tiger cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2008, 2013a). <br/><br/><br/>A declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of <em>L. guttulus</em> was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (AOO) and typical lower population densities (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em> </em>2010, 2013). Given the likely overestimation of the AOO, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. Based on the observed continuing decline in mature individuals of 50% and more in two important conservation areas for <em>Leopardus guttulus</em> a continuing decline of over 10% over 15 years (= three generations) can be estimated. Due to its low estimated population size of less than 10,000 mature individuals and the high observed population reductions, the species may even qualify for Endangered in the near future.","The Southern Tiger Cat inhabits a broad variety of habitats. These range from dense tropical and subtropical rainforests, deciduous/semideciduous, and mixed pine forests, to the open savannahs, and beach vegetation, both pristine and disturbed (Tortato and Oliveira 2005; Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, 2013; Oliveira 2011). In the Pantanal (wet/swampy savannah) it is extremely rare and has been recorded only in the dry savannahs, not in the marshy areas. Although the Southern Tiger Cat can also inhabit disturbed formations, its occurrence near agricultural fields is, nevertheless, limited by the presence of natural cover. Thus, restricted to mosaics of forest or savannah and small-scale agriculture. In these areas, both telemetry information and scat analysis indicates that it uses the natural formations and does not venture deep into the agricultural areas <em>per se</em>, but only on its borders, taking advantage of the high rodent densities (Facure-Giaretta 2002, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The species is mostly found in lowland areas, reaching up to 2,000 m above sea level.<br/><br/>Litter size is usually one, sometimes two (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Diel activity pattern is predominantly nocturno-crepuscular, but with considerable amount of daytime activity. This activity during any time of the day is suggested to be a strategy to avoid predation by the larger sympatric Ocelot (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Prey base consists mostly of small mammals, birds and lizards, with average prey size at &lt;100 g, but does include larger sized prey (&gt;1 kg) (Facure-Giaretta 2002, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Tortato 2009, Trigo&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013b). The limited information on home ranges shows that it is 2.5 times larger than they would be expected, based on the cat’s body size. This may be another consequence to avoid other larger and potential felid predators. Known home ranges for the Southern Tiger Cat range from 2 to 25 km² (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010).","The Southern Tiger Cat was heavily exploited for the fur trade decades ago, following the decline in Ocelot trade. Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. A population decline in the past few years has been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, where the density estimates dropped by more than 50%, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2013; M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, <span style="""">MMA/IBAMA 2011</span>). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012; R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comms.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between <em>L. guttulus</em> and <em>Leopardus geoffroyi</em> on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the Southern Tiger Cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Trigo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013a).","<em>Leopardus guttulus</em>&#160;population densities vary, but tend to be low throughout most of its range especially in regard to what would be expected of such a small cat species. Given its body size, expected density would be 91/100 km².&#160;&#160;Population densities of <em>L. guttulus</em> vary from one to 25/100 km². It is generally around 1-5/100 km² (or even lower) in most of its area of occupancy but can get to 13-25/100 km² in a few isolated high density areas (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Higher densities are attained only where Ocelots are absent or very rare. Where Ocelots are common or attain densities of 10/100 km² or higher, the Southern Tiger Cat is extremely rare and is expected to reach numbers much lower than 1-5/100 km². Thus, the Southern Tiger Cat is negatively impacted by Ocelots by interspecific killing due to potential for competition in what is known as the “Ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).<br/><br/>The state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil has been considered the most important area for <em>Leopardus guttulus</em> conservation and thus to harbour the best and likely most viable population. This is due to the extent of the state’s remaining Atlantic Forest, level of connectivity and the cat’s presence in reasonable numbers in local Conservation Units due in most part to the absence of Ocelots (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Nevertheless, previous high densities found in some areas there (25/100 km²) seemed to have dropped to 13/100 km² or 7/100 km² in the past few years, likely as a consequence of natural rodent reduction (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, M. Tortato pers. comm.). Therefore, expected higher densities of this species might be lower than previously thought. Considering all remaining area of natural habitat there and the species densities recorded, population size in Santa Catarina is expected to be around 1,500–2,800 (more likely towards the lower limit). Elsewhere, population reductions of <em>ca</em>. 67% have been observed due to an increase in number of Ocelots (Oliveira 2011, Marques 2013). At other areas, reductions from 20-24/100 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 8/100km<sup>2</sup>&#160;have also been noted (Oliveira 2011, Kasper <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2015), but not as a consequence of the Ocelot effect.<br/><br/>Likely as a consequence of the Ocelot effect, <em>L. guttulus</em> is found mostly outside protected areas of two of South America’s most threatened biomes, the highly fragmented Atlantic Forest, whose natural cover remaining is around 8% and the savannahs, whose remaining area is &lt;40%. In this way, conservation efforts should focus outside protected areas.<br/><br/>A declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of <em>L. guttulus</em> was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (AOO) and typical lower population densities (Oliveira 2011; Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, 2013). Given the likely overestimation of the AOO, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. A future decline of 10–30% over the next 15-18 years (= three generations) is projected due to declining AOO (habitat loss) and habitat quality. Even though the Southern Tiger Cat is found in several protected areas, no conservation units within the species’ range in Brazil or elsewhere are expected to house 500 individuals, most far below 200 (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",Decreasing,"The Southern Tiger Cat ranges from Central to southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina in the Provinces of Misiones and Corrientes. The species is absent from the Paraguayan Chaco. The northern limits of its geographic range are still unclear. It reaches Central Brazil in the states of Minas Gerais, Goiás, the border area of the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul state, and the Atlantic Forest area of eastern Bahia in the northeast region (T. de Oliveira pers. comm.). Whether it overlaps with <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>and to what extent is still unclear.

This species is Vulnerable in Argentina – still under <em>L. tigrinus</em> (Diaz and Ojeda 2000) and Brazil (MMA 2014). Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, probably because of the impact of the higher Ocelot densities and, as such, conservation efforts will have to focus outside protected areas (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008, Oliveira 2011).

In Brazil, it is taken in the largest numbers off Sao Paulo, where fishing effort has increased over the past decade and there is concern that juveniles are being taken at an unsustainable level. There is anecdotal evidence of population decline&#160;where it is targeted off Mexican coast, as well as clear evidence of decline&#160;off&#160;Cuba, however, in U.S. waters, fishers practice catch and release and there is direct observation that its population has been increasing off Texas. Furthermore, habitat degradation due to coastal development and harmful runoff may be impacting its population, as well as the introduction of less genetically varied aquacultural species into its range. At present, there is no evidence for significant declines throughout its global range, and this species is very wide spread, with little chance the pressures faced throughout its range will affect all populations, particularly with its range including multiple protected areas and protection policies. Therefore, <em>Centropomus parallelus </em>is assessed as Least Concern with recommendation to improve management of fisheries off Mexico, Cuba, and Brazil and protect its sensitive habitat, in addition to a more consistent fishery static collection.","The species inhabits coastal waters, estuaries and lagoons as well as inland freshwater lakes. <em>Centropomus parallelus</em>&#160;occurs more frequently than other snooks&#160;in interior waters (as opposed to estuarine waters) and the mangrove shorelines serve as nursery grounds for the young of the species. It feeds on fish and crustaceans (Tonini <em>et al. </em>2007, Contente <em>et al.</em> 2009), and in Veracruz, Mexico, it was found to feed especially on <em>Anchoa spp.,</em>&#160;<em>Dormitator </em>and<em> Macrobrachium</em>&#160;(Chavez 1963).<br/>Centropomids are protandric with some males turning into females. More commonly males reach 24 cm and females are typically larger than 30 cm in Espirito Santo, Brazil. The length at first maturity is 28 cm and has synchronous and partial spawning. Spawning occurs between March to August, with peaks in May and June. In March there is the predominance of smaller individuals, which leave the river with the increase of rivers flow rate (due to rainy season), whereas from May to July a predominance of larger individuals is observed, influenced by the decrease in the rivers flow rate and greater influence of saline wedge, which stimulates reproductive migration to the estuary (Rodrigues 2005). After hatching, larvae disperse with the currents to estuarine areas (Gilmore <em>et al</em>. 1983, McMichael and Parsons 1989).&#160;Its maximum total length, from all known records is 72 cm (IGFA 2001); maximum recorded weight is 5,000 g (Claro 1994).","In several fisheries, the immature individuals of <em>Centropomus parallelus</em>&#160;are caught, particularly in estuarine areas.&#160;In Guaratuba Bay, Paraná State, its habitat is degraded by chemicals, as a consequence of rice cultivation along the river margins, aquaculture tests that include the introduction of juveniles snooks produced by induced spawning, with reduced genetic variability, and the fishing effort, in which recreational fishers aim to catch the largest individuals (Chaves pers. comm. 2011).&#160;<br/>The concentration of persistent organic compounds (POPs) in sediments in the&#160;Coatzacoalcos region of Veracruz, Mexico exceeds the guidelines established by NOAA and CSQG, which represents a risk to the aquatic organisms of that region (Gonzalez-Mille<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;Aquatic organisms in this region are also threatened by rapid industrial development and population growth in addition to existing agriculture and livestock activities. Such activities promote the re-suspension of sediments which exposes aquatic organisms to pollutants that have been previously banned, including DDT (Gonzalez-Mille <em>et al.</em> 2002).&#160;Coastal development may also cause localized declines.","The species is considered common and can be locally abundant, including off the coast of Mexico.&#160;Although is a relatively common species, catch statistic are not adequately reported.&#160;It is one of the two most abundant snooks in bays, coastal lagoons, and rivers in South America (Alvarez-Lajonchere <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Brazil: </strong>It is exploited by recreational and artisanal fisheries along the Brazilian coast. In the estuarine areas of Paraná State, it is largely targeted by recreational fishers. Fishers travel from as far away as 200 km to target snooks, which creates supplements the local economy (Chaves pers. comm. 2011). In a study conducted off northeastern Brazil, this species comprised only 0.39% of the catch (Revizee).&#160;In a beach seine study conducted off Sao Paulo State, it was the sixth most frequently captured species (Fagundes <em>et al</em>. 2007). Combined landings for&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. parallellus</span>&#160;and&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. undecimalis</span>&#160;are not significant in terms of weight or number of individuals. However, it is highly desired by fishermen due to its market price, which can be ten times higher than the price of mullet, another locally caught species. Peak catch occurs between February-April and November-December (Mendonça and Katsuragawa 2001). Landings in some areas, such as Cananéia (Brazil), are stable or increasing.&#160;Catch of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. parallelus</span> in São Paulo State average about 100 ton/year with the majority occurring on the southern coast (60% at least). Off southern São Paulo,&#160;3% of landings over the past few years have been comprised of immature individuals. Peak catch occurs between October-April (Mendonça 2007). Over the past ten years, CPUE in the artisanal gillnet fishery has been increasing. In 2009, landings in the estuarine artisanal fishery totaled 23.6 t, of which 80% were under the length of first maturation (Mendonça, pers. comm. 2011).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Gulf of Mexico: </strong>This species&#160;is highly desirable where it is sold in Mexican markets. It is commercially targeted off Mexico and recreationally targeted off Florida and Texas by hook and line (mainly catch and release) (J. Tolan and H. Espinosa-Perez pers. comm. 2014). According to independent gill net surveys off Texas, the populations have increased dramatically (J. Tolan pers. comm. 2014). There are some reports from Mexican fishers that catch of this species has been declining, however, there are no formal assessments or surveys available (H. Espinosa-Perez pers. comm. 2014). It is also commercially targeted off Cuba and there is evidence that its population has been declining.",Unknown,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral, and Tampa Bay Florida and from Cuba and the Florida Keys southwards. It can be found also in the Gulf of Mexico from Tamaulipas to Tabasco, and along Mexican coastline from the border with Texas to Tabasco.

145360542,22956,Vicugna vicugna,Least Concern,,2018,2018-07-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The species is classified as Least Concern given its wide range of distribution, population size, the increasing trend, and its occurrence in several protected areas, agreeing with the last assessment in 2008. However, it is important to note that improved conservation programs and tighter control at local, national and international levels are necessary for the conservation of the species, given the degree of poaching with the troubling increase of this illicit activity during the last decade. The inadequate control of this unlawful activity and prohibited commercialization of the Vicuña’s high-priced fibre in international markets are the main driving forces of concern. It is thus important to reinforce and promote political actions to control the current situation in order to avoid the risk of revisiting past circumstances that left the species near extinction during the 60s of the past century. National conservation and management plans of the species have been developed since the last assessment, but there exist uncertainties since their implementation have not always been accomplished. Approved live-shearing of Vicuñas is widespread throughout the Andes, most of which, but not all, are within the challenging framework of actual sustainable use. The needed approach requires greater commitment by local communities and the authorities in charge to protect the species and its habitat, together with stricter control of the commercialization process. In addition, the disease mange caused by the mite <em>Sarcoptes scabiei</em> is increasing at an alarming rate in several populations of Perú, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile; the identified causes include the presence of domestic animals with poor sanitary controls and other infected Vicuñas due to poor management practices. Concern about this situation has compelled the authorities to initiate ""research programs” especially in populations whose survival are at risk. The impact of climate change on the already extremely arid, high-altitude Vicuña habitats is a real concern, especially in conjunction with the deterioration of grasslands due to overgrazing by domestic livestock. In addition, a risk that should not be neglected is the hybridization of Vicuñas with alpacas, a backdoor illegal way of exporting Vicuña genes. Finally, the impact of expanding mining activities in the high Andes requires scientific monitoring to ensure the species is not negatively affected.&#160;</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Vicuña is a high-altitude ungulate distributed throughout the Andean Mountains from 3,000 to 5,000 masl, in the Puna and High Andean ecorregions. This vast region is characterized by cold-dry weather and dominated by xerophytic vegetation and large areas of bare ground (Franklin 2011). Within this wide region Vicuña habitats include shallow wetlands (called ‘vegas’ in Chile and Argentina, ‘bofedales’ in Bolivia and ‘bofedales or mojadales in Perú), halophytic plant communities, grassy steppes, prairies, shruby steppes, and rolling shrub steppes (tolares) supporting cacti (Pujalte and Reca 1985). Vegas or bofedales in the entire region are extremely scarce (oasis) but are intensively used by Vicuñas due to the presence of water and high-quality forage compared to the widely distributed poor-xeric habitats (Lucherini 1996). Vicuñas daily activity patterns and movements are also strongly influenced by water availability, especially during the summer, given that they are obligate drinkers (Franklin 2011), while in the night and early morning Vicuñas move to hillsides to avoid predation from pumas (Renaudeau d'Arc <em>et al.</em> 2000, Donadio and Buskirk 2016) and culpeo foxes (Franklin 1978).&#160;&#160;</p><p>  </p><p>Vicuña is a medium-sized, monomorphic (adults <em>V. v. mensalis</em> 38 kg, <em>V. v. vicugna</em> 46 kg) generalist herbivore that behaves as a facultative grazer that can also include shrubs in its diet (Borgnia <em>et al.</em> 2010, Mosca Torres and Puig 2010). However, grazing of grasses and forbs is its primary activity. Vicuña populations are sedentary; no migratory populations have been recorded to date. The Vicuña social system is based on a resource defense polygyny mating system in which females are attracted to a feeding area monopolized by a territorial male that form family groups (Franklin 1982, 2011) Females primarily remain within the male’s territory (Franklin 1974), although some populations have movement of individuals between different social units resulting in a variable social organization (Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2018). These territories are defended year-round. Bachelor male groups, and solo males are also found among the primary social units. Census at the Pampa Galeras-Barbara D’Achillie Vicuña Reserve showed 68% of the population in family groups, 31% male groups, 1% solo males and with most males (69%) in bachelor male groups (Informe Perú 2011). Average family group size is very stable among populations and subspecies (one male, two to four females and one to two offspring (Koford 1957; Franklin 1974, 1983; Vilá 1992; Lucherini 1996; Arzamendia and Vilá 2012; Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2018). Family groups tend to occupy territories in higher quality habitats compared to male groups (Franklin 1974, 1978, 1983; Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2006; Borgnia <em>et al.</em> 2010; Arzamendia and Vilá 2015; Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2018), and do not overlap (Franklin 1974, 1983; Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2018). Home ranges average about 18 ha (Franklin 1983, Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2018). Gestation lasts approximately 11.3 months (Bravo 2002), followed by 8 months of lactation. Offspring are born during late summer, the period of maximum primary productivity of the steppe ecosystem. Approximately two weeks later the females are bred again. Male and female offspring are forcefully dispersed by the territorial male from their natal family group before the next reproductive period (Franklin 1974, 1983, 2011), with the relocation of females to non-parental family groups, and males to bachelor groups (Franklin 1974, Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2018). Areas used by family groups contain many dust bathing locations (“revolcaderos”) and communal dung piles (“bosteaderos, estercoleros”). Males do not typically reproduce unless they hold a feeding territory.</p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>  Poaching triggered by international illegal market demands of Vicuña fibre continues to be the major threat to the species. According to the Technical Meeting of the Vicuña Convention (2015) there has been, with the exception of Ecuador, an alarming increase in Vicuña poaching throughout its range, especially affecting isolated Chilean and relict populations whose marginal distribution increases their vulnerability. Among the factors that facilitate poaching of Vicuñas in the high Andes are (SACSG, 2014): 1) The wide geographic range of Vicuña populations and the extensive long frontier areas among the countries involved; 2) The geographic characteristics of the area, with low Vicuña population densities and a high degree of isolation; 3) Lack of human and technical resources devoted to protection of the species in the host countries; 4) High value of the fibre and Vicuña products in the international market; 5) Existence of a substantial market for illegal fibre and handcrafts at the local level; 6) Lack of effective punishment for illegal hunters; 7) Insufficient confiscation of illegal products; 8) Limited coordinated security forces within and between countries; 9) Limited benefits to local communities, and sometimes insufficient support and incentives to develop legal Vicuña use, resulting in greater benefits from illegal than from legal uses. Thus, it is considered of particular relevance that the following measures to be promoted:</p><p>A) On cooperation among Andean countries:</p><p>1. Intensification of inter-boundary cooperation among neighbouring countries, including security forces, for the control of international frontiers to optimize efforts to eliminate illegal traffic.</p><p>2. Critical revision of the compliance with previous agreements and documents, developed during Technical Meetings of the Vicuña Convention on Vicuña poaching and trafficking.</p><p>3. Standardized registry in the five countries of legally obtained fibre, its processing, imports and exports, in order to be able to monitor its commercialization.</p><p>B) At the national level:<br/></p><p>1. Information dissemination regarding legal sanctions and the updating of national, regional, and local laws to make them more effective against poaching and illegal commercialization of Vicuña fibre and products.<br/></p><p>2. Facilitation and support of local Andean communities in the development of technical and organizational capacities to harvest fibre from their Vicuñas under strict animal welfare protocols and strengthening local community organizations.<br/></p><p>3. Governmental support to local Andean communities in the commercialization and value-added processes of legal fibre, simplifying the process and strengthening the stages of the legal chain of commercialization.<br/></p><p>4. Supply of sufficient legal fibre for local artisan use at subsidized prices, to minimize use of illegal fibre and increasing value added processes in the countries of origin.<br/></p><p>5. Reinforcing and implementation at the national level of schemes of supervision, legal oversight, and tracing origins of the fibre, from shearing to its conclusion on the supply chain (shearing, storage, transformation, commercialization, and export).<br/></p><p>6. Permanent training of police, judicial and customs authorities, with respect to legislation and other subjects related to production and movement of fibre, as well as identification of camelid fibres and their sub-products.<br/></p><p>7. The intensification of seizures of illegal clothing and the implementation of sanctions to those involved in purchasing or selling them.<br/></p><p>8. Implementation of informative and awareness campaigns, especially at touristic sites and airports, alerting tourists of the requirements to be met by legal Vicuña fibre products.<br/></p><p>C) On the cooperation between exporting and importing countries:<br/></p><p>1. Strengthening of local cooperation networks and swifter communication between CITES authorities and importing and exporting countries.<br/></p><p>2. Development and collaboration in the implementation of systems to trace the origin of Vicuña products and sub-products, to be implemented internationally.<br/></p><p>3. The strengthening of controls in the importing countries regarding the processing and marketing Vicuña products and sub-products.<br/></p><p>Despite the fact that participating countries are moving forward in the development of National Management and Conservation plans since the last Vicuña assessment (2008), as well as the provision of guidelines for sustainable management and animal welfare criteria, the lack of specific budgets or poor funding hinder achievement of conservation and management actions.&#160;<br/></p><p>Recent studies have shown that capture, handling, live-shearing and releasing wild Vicuñas under strict sustainable management and welfare protocols (although showing subtle and transitory behavioural and social structure changes after being released) does not compromise the conservation or maintenance of ecologically functional wild populations (Sahley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Arzamendia and Vilá 2012, Marcoppido <em>et al.</em> 2017). Among the two widely used methods for capturing Vicuñas, the traditional ‘Chaku’ (surround-capture by people on foot) results in less stress on animals than the use of motor vehicles to chase the animals (Sarno <em>et al.</em> 2009, Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;On the other hand, captive management has proven to have&#160;no contribution to&#160;Vicuña conservation (Lichtenstein 2006). <br/></p><p>Vicuñas, domestic camelids and introduced livestock have similar foraging preferences and share Andean habitats. As a result, local people perceive Vicuñas as a competitive species, and do not tolerate their presence (Lichtenstein and Renaudeau d'Arc 2004). This is especially worrisome around wetland (bofedales) habitats which are critical for Vicuñas (Koford 1957, Renaudeau d'Arc <em>et al.</em> 2000, Mosca Torres and Puig 2012, Mosca Torres <em>et al.</em> 2015) and locally shared with domestic animals (Borgnia <em>et al.</em> 2008, Wurstten <em>et al.</em> 2014, Arzamendia and Vilá 2015, McLaren <em>et al.</em> 2018). Vicuñas are frequently displaced by livestock, from the high-quality habitats to sub-optimal low-productivity habitats (Borgnia <em>et al.</em> 2008), where they still are able to persist. Further, the presence of herders with dogs represents an important stress factor for Vicuñas (Arzamendia and Vilá 2015).&#160;<br/></p><p>Habitat loss triggered by livestock over-grazing, and habitat fragmentation due to industrial and rural sprawl, and the development of large-scale mining projects may jeopardize the viability of Vicuña populations located beyond protected areas. Mining activities directly impact Vicuña populations by occupying preferred habitats and as a result of road kills due to high traffic levels, heavy machinery employed etc., and indirectly through the extraction and pollution of water resources (Mata <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/></p><p>Climate change will probably have a detrimental impact in the fragile ecosystems where Vicuñas occur since they are at the limits of habitable environments. Therefore, the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on Vicuña’s habitats is a priority.<br/></p><p>Epidemiological studies on Vicuña wild populations in Bolivia, Perú and Argentina that share spatial and forage resources with domestic camelids and livestock do not show prevalence levels of endo- or ectoparasites that seem to be a problem for the viability of their populations (Chávez-Velásquez <em>et al.</em> 2005, Beltrán-Saavedra <em>et al.</em> 2011, Arzamendia <em>et al.</em> 2012, Marcoppido <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, a growing concern is emerging since some Vicuña populations throughout their distribution are suffering from mange caused by the mite <em>Sarcoptes scabiei</em>. For example, two important protected areas for the species’ conservation are showing a high incidence of mange: San Guillermo National Park (San Juan, Argentina), created to preserve the two South American wild camelids in Argentina, and Pampa Galeras Bárbara D’Achille National Reserve (Ayachuco, Perú), the latter which symbolized the recovery of the species from the brick of extinction in the 60s of the past century. In San Guillermo the problem probably has to do with the introduction of domestic camelids without sanitary controls or quarantine, while in the case of other populations it is due to mismanagement practices related to the capture and shearing of animals, including incomplete preventive veterinary treatments, management without welfare, and overcrowding of animals creating stress. This situation also causes huge economic losses to the local communities because of the drop of Vicuña fibre price.&#160;&#160;<br/></p><p>A potential threat both in the Andes and worldwide, is the breeding of paco-Vicuña (an alpaca/Vicuña hybrid) mainly promoted in developed countries out of the Vicuña distribution range for commercial purposes. The alpaca was domesticated from the Vicuña approximately 6-7,000 years ago (Wheeler 2012). During domestication and subsequent selective breeding, the genome was modified away from its Vicuña origin. Additional significant changes in the alpaca genome also occurred during the Spanish conquest when large numbers were slaughtered, and subsequent massive hybridization with llamas. DNA studies have shown that alpaca and llama pertain to different genera, <em>Vicugna </em>and <em>Lama</em> respectively, and at least 80% of alpacas in the Andes carry llama genes (Kadwell <em>et al.</em> 2001). Thus, hybridization between alpacas and Vicuñas represents a real threat because of the mixing of alpaca genes into the Vicuña genome, something that has not occurred in nature.</p>","<p><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">  </p><p><strong>Perú</strong> has the highest numbers of Vicuñas with over half of the total world’s population. Although its conservation has faced difficulties, surveys carried out by different entities of the Ministry of Agriculture over 70,000 km² reported 66,559 Vicuñas in 1994, 103,161 in 1997, 118,678 in 2000 and 208,899 in 2012. A total population of 218,000 Vicuñas was estimated in 2016. Currently, Vicuñas occur is six protected areas (Pampa Galeras Bárbara D’Achille National Reserve, Huascarán National Park, Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve, Nor Yauyos – Cochas and Sub Cuenca del Cotahuasi Lanscape Reserves, and Santuario Histórico de Chacamarca) totalling 1,427,754 ha and 20,122 Vicuñas (10% of total population). Pampa Galeras- Barbara d’Achille National Reserve in Ayacucho department was established in 1965 to protect the largest concentration of Vicuñas in Perú. Starting with a total of 5,000 to 10,000 Vicuñas in the 1960s, the population in Ayacucho has expanded to 62,133 animals (2012), representing the largest population in the country. The species in Perú is listed as Near Threatened (MINAGRI 2014).<br/></p><p>In <strong>Bolivia</strong>, Vicuñas are distributed throughout the Puna and high Andean region of La Paz, Oruro, Potosi, Cochabamba and Tarija departments. According to the 2009 census, a total of 112,249 Vicuñas were recorded. In 2016, total population was estimated to be to 163,331 individuals. Potosi has the largest Vicuña population (39%), followed by La Paz Department (33%) and Oruro (26%); Tarija and Cochabamba have the smallest Vicuña populations (MMAyA 2010). Both Vicuña subspecies are present in the country; the Northern Subspecies (<em>V. v. mensalis</em>) represents 65% of the Bolivian Vicuña population, and the Southern Subspecies (<em>V. v. vicugna</em>) 35%. Species density in the northern populations in semi-humid high-Andes habitats is relatively high (10.31 animals/km²); while its density in the semi-arid Puna is low (0.004 animals/km²) (MMAyA 2010). According to the Bolivian governmental report there are 17,838 Vicuñas (16% of total population) in four protected areas (Area Natural de Manejo Integrado Nacional Apolobamba, Sajama National Park, Eduardo Avaroa Fauna National Reserve and Coordillera de Sama Biological Reserve), totalling&#160;1,397,271 ha. The protected Area Natural de Manejo Integrado Nacional Apolobamba has the largest Vicuña population (11,878 Vicuñas) and highest density (10.3 animals/km²) (MMAyA 2010). The species in Bolivia is classified as Least Concern (Aguirre <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/></p><p><strong>Chile</strong> holds populations of both subspecies: <em>V. v. mensalis</em> in the northern region with the most abundant numbers (10,215 Vicuñas; 2016) and the southern <em>V. v. vicugna</em> with 1888 Vicuñas (2016). Vicuñas occur in six protected areas (Las Vicuñas and Los Flamencos Reserves, Volcan Isluga, Lauca, Nevado de Tres Cruces National Parks and Salar de Surire Natural Monument) totalling a protected area of 2,788,532 ha. Only populations inhabiting Lauca National Park and Las Vicuñas Reserve have been monitored since the 1970s (Bonacic <em>et al.</em> 2002, Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2012). Recent surveys have revealed a decline of nearly 5000 animals from 2008 to 2017. The species in Chile is listed as Endangered (MINAGRI 1998).<br/></p><p>In <strong>Argentina</strong> Vicuñas inhabit an area of 123,001 km². The provinces with the largest Vicuña populations are Jujuy and Catamarca, while La Rioja holds the lowest numbers. Approximately 34% of country’s distribution occurs in eight conservation areas that receive different degrees of protection (San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve, Laguna Blanca and Laguna de Pozuelos Biosphere reserves, Chinchilla, Laguna Brava, Laguna de Leandro and Los Andes and Olaroz-Cauchari Provincial reserves, all totalling 2,935,154 ha). The total population size was last estimated in 2006 between 72,800 and 127,072 individuals, based upon representative sampled areas totalling 53,578 km². The species in Argentina is classified as Least Concern (Ojeda <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/></p><p>In <strong>Ecuador</strong>, Vicuñas were introduced in Chimborazo Faunal Production Reserve (58,560 ha) thanks to donations of 200 individuals from Chile and Perú in 1988, and 77 from Bolivia in 1993. This protected area is located in Chimborazo, Bolivar and Tungurahua provinces, created specifically for Vicuña conservation. The census carried out during 2000-2016 showed an exponential annual growth rate of 11% reaching 7,185 individuals in 2016 (MAE 2016), suggesting that neither predation nor carrying capacity are currently regulating the species in the area (McLaren <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;<br/></p><p><strong>Total Population Size: </strong></p><p>The total South American Vicuña population is between 473,297 – 527,691, i.e. ca. 500,494 animals with 46% in Perú, 29% in Bolivia, 21% in Argentina, 3% in Chile, and 2% in Ecuador. However, there exists several uncertainties due to 1) different methodologies employed in the various countries; in some cases, the censuses are extrapolations or estimations while in others they are real counts; 2) censuses are not updated; for example, the national census in Argentina is from 2006, in Bolivia 2009, and in Perú from 2012, and 3) the total population is suspected to be larger since several censuses were performed mainly in protected areas, despite the fact that Vicuñas occur beyond those limited areas. In keeping with the Precautionary Principle and taking into account current information, the total Vicuña population is considered to be increasing.</p><p>As a general rule, it is recommended to survey Vicuña populations by the distance sampling method, either for ground or aerial surveys since it is based on more realistic assumptions rather than the fixed-width strip transect methods which tend to underestimate population numbers (Buckland <em>et al. </em>1993). However, where numbers are too low, as in relict or new populations, and in topographically feasible terrain, total direct counts are appropriate. Also, extrapolation of local densities to larger areas must be applied with caution and made according to sampling effort. Accurate estimates of local densities are not sufficient to estimate abundance for larger areas unless the sampling effort is properly applied throughout the region.&#160;In summary, an update of total population of the species using inference-based methodologies is needed.<br/></p><p>Country Vicuña population (censused/estimated):&#160;</p><p><strong>Perú</strong>: 208,899 (national census, MINAGRI 2012); 218,000 (estimated population, MINAGRI 2016)</p><p></p><p><strong>Bolivia</strong>: 112,249 (national census, 2009); 163,331 (estimated population, Vicuña Convention 2017)</p><p><strong>Chile</strong>: 12,103 (Vicuña Convention 2017)</p><p><strong>Argentina</strong>: 72,678 – 127,072 (2006 national census, Baigún <em>et al. </em>2008)&#160; </p><p><strong>Ecuador</strong>: 7,185 (Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment 2016)</p><p>The total Vicuña population is 473,297 – 527,691 (censused/estimated).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p></p><p>  Vicuñas occur in an area of approximately 300,000 km² in the Puna and High Andean biogeographic provinces of Perú, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, in a range that extends 2,800 km from 9°50'S in the Ancash Department of Perú to the north-western region of San Juan, Argentina (29°14′S, 69°21′W), plus an isolated population in Ecuador resulting from a donation from Perú, Chile and Bolivia, which represents the northernmost distribution (1°30′S) of the species.&#160;</p><p>In <strong>Perú</strong>, Vicuñas occur in the departments of Ayacucho, Puno, Huancavelica, Junín, Cusco, Arequipa, Apurimac and Lima, representing 96% of country’s total population, while the remaining 4% occur in the departments of Ica, Moquegua, Cajamarca, Tacna, Pasco, La Libertad, Ancash and Huánuco.<br/></p><p>In <strong>Bolivia</strong>, Vicuña populations are found in five out of nine Bolivian departments: La Paz, Cochabamba, Oruro, Potosí and Tarija.

Vicuñas were captured, sheared and released using a technique known as “chaku”, which required the organization and participation of hundreds of people. With the Spanish conquest Vicuña populations began a sharp decline due to over-exploitation of their meat, skin and fibre, and populations dropped until they faced a real threat of extinction in the 1960s. Perú led the way in protecting the species, assisted by international coordination and financial support. In 1975 all Vcuña populations were included in CITES Appendix I, prohibiting the international trade of its valuable fibre. Twenty years later, in 1995, the entire Peruvian population and the north Chilean populations were reclassified and listed under CITES Appendix II, permitting international sale of fibre and cloth from live shorn animals. All other populations were included in Appendix I. The Andean communities began harvesting fibre from live-captured animals, while fibre export and import and the trade of products derived there from were allowed under tight and strictly controlled regulations (Franklin 2011). At present Vicuñas are live-shorn under sustainable or striving towards sustainability schemes in all populations of Perú, Bolivia, the northern populations (<em>V. v. mensalis</em>) of Chile and several populations in Argentina. Ecuador has recently started to harvest Vicuñas experimentally to assess their health status and the quality of their fibre.<br/></p><p>Throughout their range, an important management strategy is the capture and release of wild-free roaming Vicuñas, although a proportion of the population is managed as captive animals.&#160;<br/></p><p>In 2016, nearly 60% of all Vicuña in <strong>Perú</strong> were under live-shearing management by 247 rural organizations; and 70% of the fibre production came from free ranging animals, while the remaining 30% came from captive populations. In 2017 55% of fibre production came from wild populations, while the remaining 45% from semi-captivity animals, and 9,815 kg of fibre were obtained from shearing 56,590 animals representing 49% of the fibre production that was exported. Italy was the main importer (4,659 kg, 96%), followed by China (199 kg, 4%) creating an annual income of 2,299,762 US$ (FOB value) (MINAGRI 2017).<br/></p><p>In <strong>Bolivia</strong> Vicuña fibre is obtained from wild populations by local Andean communities. Indeed, the Bolivian National Government placed those local communities in charge of fibre use and exploitation through organized Vicuñas management local communities (Comunidades Manejadoras de Vicuñas). The National Biodiversity and protected areas Administration authorize, supervise and monitor the species management and trading of Vicuña while provides technical and economic support to local communities involved in the Vicuña management. In 2017, Bolivia exported 2,546 kg of Vicuña fibre to Italy for 900,000 US$.<br/></p><p>In <strong>Chile</strong> 45.6 kg of Vicuña fibre was harvested in the I Region (Arica and Parinacota) from captive Vicuña populations (2015).<br/></p><p>In <strong>Argentina</strong> 245 kg of fibre were harvested from live animals by local communities in 2016 while a private international company obtained 980 kg, from a total of 2,754 Vicuñas; 143 kg of fibre were obtained from captivity Vicuñas and 1762 kg of fibre exported.<br/></p><p>New legislation recently came into effect under the CITES Appendices (2017) to improve monitoring and tracking of Vicuña fibre and the<u> </u>trade in legal products derived from Vicuña fibre. The aim is to simplify the five annotations related to populations belonging to Appendix II into only one, with a clear content, without ambiguities to effectively track the fibre exported in order to strengthen the control of international trade. Another important aim is to promote the implementation of ""Vicuña country of origin"" wording, clarifying the mark or logo adopted by the participating countries that are signatories to the Convention for the Conservation and Management of the Vicuña in order to monitor legal fibre and avoiding illegal trade.<br/></p><p>The paradox of Vicuña fibre use and trade is that while it is mainly produced by low-income Andean communities that in many cases fall within poverty limits, Vicuña garments are sold in the most exclusive fashion houses in Europe, USA, Asia and Australia reaching prices only affordable by very affluent consumers (Lichtenstein 2010).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">  </p><p>Five decades ago, the Vicuña was one of the most threatened species in South America. The implementation of the Vicuña Convention was fundamental in the recovery of the species. In 1987, during the Sixth CITES Conference of Parties, Perú obtained for the first time, along with other countries, authorization for the sale of fabric made from live shorn Vicuña fibre. The Vicuña Convention was implemented in each country in accordance with its own National Legislation. The ownership status of the Vicuña varies somewhat; as a wild species it is the property of the State in Bolivia and Perú and of the Andean communities in which lands the species occur, while <em>res nullius</em> (without owner) in Chile and Argentina.&#160; Although all the conservation aspects of the Vicuña Convention are embodied in National Laws and Decrees in all four countries, this is not always the case as regards granting benefits to local people (McNeill <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/></p><p>Currently various Vicuña populations are included in the Appendix II of CITES: all populations in Perú, Bolivia and Ecuador, the northern populations in Chile (I Region; <em>V.v. mensalis</em>) and the populations in Jujuy and Catamarca Provinces, and the captive populations of Jujuy, Salta, Catamarca, La Rioja and San Juan Provinces in Argentina. Appendix II allows, under strict regulations between exporting and importing countries, the trade in fibre and derived products. The remaining populations are included in Appendix I.&#160;<br/></p><p>In 1965 when no more than 10,000 Vicuñas were thought to exist, <strong>Perú</strong> established the Pampa Galeras National Vicuña Reserve in Ayacucho (later renamed Bárbara D’Achille for the Perúvian conservationist). Conservation strategy was based upon protection with the use of armed park guards and later rational utilization through controlled culling that led to an international debate and disenfranchisement of the indigenous communities. Despite these difficulties, population numbers increased, with 63,223 Vicuñas counted in Pampa Galeras and surrounding region in a survey covering 2,985,757 ha in 1997. In that same year the populations in the Departments of Ayacucho, Junín, Puno and Arequipa were transferred to CITES Appendix II status, opening international trade for fibre from live-shorn Vicuñas. Conservation policy shifted to sustainable utilization through live shearing and sale of fibre by those Andean communities with lands in the Vicuña’s range. Extensive new Vicuña reserves were established at Salinas and Aguada Blanca in Arequipa and Huascaran National Park in Ancash. The Ministry of Agriculture’s Special Project for Rational Utilization of the Vicuña (1978 -1993) was replaced by the National Council for South American Camelids – CONACS, an institution comprised of representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, camelid research institutions, regional governments, campesino communities and the National Society of Vicuña Breeders. As a multi-sectorial entity, CONACS held responsibility for overseeing Vicuña conservation, live shearing and Vicuña fibre trade. Two major problems associated with the CONACS administration have been the increase of captive rearing (30% of all Vicuña in 2012) and the indiscriminate transfer of Vicuña between genetically distinct populations (Wheeler <em>et al.</em> 2001) which require separate management.&#160; Since the closure of CONACS in February 2007, responsibility for Vicuña conservation has been fractured. The executive functions of CONACS were transferred to 16 Regional Governments each under the leadership of the National Forest and Wildlife Service national authority. At the national level responsibility for Vicuña conservation has been subdivided. Actually, the National Forestry and Wildlife Service, an agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, is in charge of the politics, regulation and control of activities related to the management, conservation and use of wild camelids and is the CITES Administrative authority. The Ministry of the Environment through the National Service of Protected Natural Areas - SERNANP has the responsibility to protect the Vicuñas within the park system, national reserves and is the CITES scientific authority. This fragmentation of authority complicates and hinders conservation efforts, although the Vicuña populations continue to grow in Perú with a total of 208,899 reported in 2012.&#160;<br/></p><p>As one of the conservation policies of the species, Perú has adapted the reintroduction or repopulation of Vicuñas in areas where the species occurred in the past, or where there are small and / or vulnerable populations, and in areas where natural pastures and water guarantee survival of the species, also benefiting organized local communities.<br/></p><p>Since 1980, Vicuñas have been reported in 38 areas in the <strong>Bolivian</strong> high Andes. These areas were nominated for inclusion in the national Vicuña Protection Areas (VPA) and grouped into nine Conservation and Management Units but are no longer being considered. For the 2009 census three new categories have been defined: 1) Protected areas, 2) Areas under use, and 3) Areas without management. Presently rational utilization of Vicuñas is being conducted in 3 out of 4 protected areas. The Vicuña populations in Bolivia remains insecure, mainly due to inappropriate land use practices that contribute to habitat degradation, something exacerbated by climate change. Another important threat is poaching, whose control is complex because of the wide extent of areas where Vicuñas occur.&#160;<br/></p><p>The Vicuña population in <strong>Chile</strong> showed some recovery as a result of the implementation of conservation actions, including the creation of several protected areas, lessening the high risk of extinction in the past. However, recent surveys have revealed a decline in the total population of nearly 5000 animals from 2008 to 2017. Further, there remain small and isolated populations that require the implementation of effective conservation plans. At present, the Chilean Forest Service (Corporación Nacional Forestal, CONAF) carries out annual censuses by direct counts within the protected areas where the species occurs, supports several research projects, and runs a long-term environmental education program through various communication media. There are four conservation areas inhabited by Vicuña in Chile. Two more have been proposed and others are currently being studied. Further, under the Vicuña National Conservation Plan there exist two different strategies depending on the Vicuña sub-species and their conservations status. Thus, the populations of the Northern subspecies (<em>V.v. mensalis</em>) are included in the CITES Appendix II and being managed under sustainable use (trade of Vicuña fibre) aimed at increasing the economic incomes of local communities, while the populations of the southern Subspecies (<em>V.v. vicugna</em>) are included in the Appendix I.&#160; Management actions are oriented towards the protection of relict populations, especially in protected areas, with endorsement awaiting ratification through the National Conservation Plan for the Austral Vicuña.&#160;<br/></p><p>In <strong>Argentina</strong>, there are six Vicuña conservation areas in the northwest, most are managed by the provincial governments. The Ley Nacional de Fauna 22,421 provides a legal framework at the federal level; there are also provincial laws both for wildlife in general and specific for Vicuña.<br/></p><p><strong>Ecuador</strong> ratified in 1982 the accession to the International Convention of Vicuña Conservation and Management. Within this framework, the introduction of Vicuñas took place in the Chimborazo plateau that created the Chimborazo Faunal Production Reserve (1987). In 2004 the “Regulation for the Management and Conservation of the Vicuña in Ecuador” was approved forming the basis for the “National Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of the Vicuña” as a requisite to change the Vicuña population to the CITES Appendix II, that was formally approved in 2013.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Sexual size dimorphism indices of 2.10, 2.13, 2.09, 2.08, and 2.13 were calculated for populations in coastal Belize and the Caribbean coast of Mexico (Platt <em>et al.</em> 2011; Labarre <em>et al</em>. 2017). Both sexes exhibit a pronounced median pre-orbital ridge (POR) on the skull, which may be sexually dimorphic and appears to vary geographically among <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> populations (Thorbjarnarson 1989; Platt and Rainwater 2005). The American Crocodile is characterized by the most reduced and irregular dorsal armour (osteoderms) of any crocodilian (Ross and Mayer 1983). Inter-populational differences in scalation likely exist in this widely ranging species (Seijas 2002; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2012), and recent studies have also shown high intraspecific variation in the post-occipital, cervical, and dorsal scalation, allowing for individual identification (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2017). Population-specific size estimation models for <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> are available for Belize (Platt <em>et al.</em> 2011), Mexico (Labarre <em>et al.</em> 2017), and Coiba Island, Panama (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018b). &#160;</p>  <p>The habitat of <em>C. acutus </em>consists largely of brackish water coastal habitats such as the saltwater sections of rivers, coastal lagoons, and mangrove swamps. <em>Crocodylus acutus</em> inhabits offshore cays (islands) and atolls where it survives under true marine conditions (Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000a; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2013; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2005; González Cortés 2007; Venegas-Anaya <em>et al</em>. 2015). Populations are also known from freshwater habitats located well inland, including a number of reservoirs (Medem 1981; Mandujano-Camacho and Rodas-Trejo 2010; Sigler 2010; Espinal and Escobedo-Galván 2011). A significant population inhabits Lago Enriquillo, a landlocked hypersaline lake situated 40 m below sea level in the arid southwestern Dominican Republic (Schubert 2002). A robust population also inhabits Cayo Centro, an island in Banco Chinchorro atoll located 50 km from southern coast of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. During the dry season, lagoons on Cayo Centro can experience extremely hypersaline conditions (up to 61 ppt; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;&#160;</p>  <p>Knowledge on&#160;<em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> has increased rapidly over the few past decades, and much research has been conducted on reproductive ecology (Platt and Thorbjarnarson 1997, 2000b; Mazzotti <em>et al</em>. 2007a; Charruau <em>et al.</em> 2010a, 2011; 2017a; Escobedo-Galván <em>et al.</em> 2019; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2014a; Charruau 2012; Charruau and Hénaut 2012; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al.</em> 2015a; Murray <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016; González-Desales <em>et al.</em> 2016; Ferguson <em>et al.</em> 2017; Gómez-González <em>et al.</em> 2017), nutrition, diet, and foraging ecology (Platt <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2013a, b, 2014b, Richards and Wasilewski 2003; Gómez Hernández 2004; Cupul-Magaña <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2015; Villegas and Schmitter-Soto 2008; Ávila Cervantes <em>et al</em>. 2017; Hernández-Hurtado <em>et al.</em> 2018; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al.</em> 2018a; Triminio <em>et al.</em> 2019), morphometrics (Domínguez-Laso 2009; Platt <em>et al</em>. 2011; Platt and Rainwater 2005; Rainwater <em>et al.</em> 2010; Domínguez-Laso 2017; Labarre <em>et al.</em> 2017), scalation (Seijas 2002; Platt <em>et al</em>. 2012; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al.</em> 2017; Boucher <em>et al.</em> 2017; English 2017), growth (Pérez and Escobedo-Galván 2009; Charruau 2011; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2010b; García-Grajales <em>et al</em>. 2012, Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015a), movement and spatial ecology (Wheatley <em>et al</em>. 2012; Cherkiss <em>et al</em>. 2014; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2016; Beauchamp <em>et al.</em> 2018; Farlow <em>et al</em>. 2018a, b; Beauchamp <em>et al.</em> 2019), population genetics (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2004; Cedeño-Vázquez <em>et al</em>. 2008; Porras Murillo <em>et al</em>. 2008; Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011; Weaver <em>et al</em>. 2008; Machkour-M’Rabet <em>et al</em>. 2009; Milián-García <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015; González-Trujillo <em>et al</em>. 2012; Bashyal <em>et al</em>. 2014; Bloor <em>et al</em>. 2015, Budd <em>et al</em>. 2015; Hekkala <em>et al</em>. 2015; Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2016; Serrano-Gómez <em>et al</em>. 2016; Mauger <em>et al</em>. 2017; Milián-García <em>et al.</em> 2018a, b; Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2018), behavior in captivity (Benko and Perc 2009); physiology and biochemistry (Merchant <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b), parasitology and bacteriology (Villegas and Gonzáles-Solís 2009; Pérez-Flores <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2017; Tellez and Paquet-Durand 2011; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2016, 2017b; Escobedo-Galván <em>et al.</em> 2012; Charruau and González-Muñoz 2015; Rainwater <em>et al.</em> 2015; Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2019), ecotoxicology (Wu <em>et al</em>. 2000; Rainwater <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2011; Charruau <em>et al.</em> 2013; Murray <em>et al.</em> 2017), and conflict with humans (Barrantes 2010; Cupul-Magaña <em>et al.</em> 2010; Balaguera-Reina 2012, 2013; Bolaños Montero, 2012; García-Grajales and Buenrstro-Silva 2013; García-Grajales <em>et al</em>. 2013; Carrillo-Rivera and Porras-Murillo 2014; Ponce-Campos 2014; Balaguera-Reina and Farfán-Ardila 2018; García-Grajales and Buenrostro-Silva 2018, 2019).</p>  <p><em>Crocodylus acutus </em>is a hole-nesting species, but adaptable in terms of nesting ecology, in some areas creating elevated mounds of substrate into which eggs are deposited (Thorbjarnarson 1989; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 1997; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000b; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2011). Clutch size is typically 30 to 60 eggs, although in some populations mean clutch size is in the low 20s (Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000b, Sigler 2010; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015a) or less (i.e. &lt;17 at Banco Chinchorro; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2010a). As with most hole nesting species of crocodilians, <em>C. acutus </em>nests during the annual dry season, with eggs hatching around the beginning of the annual wet season (Thorbjarnarson 1989; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000b, Sigler 2010; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015a; Casas-Andreu 2003; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2011; González-Desales <em>et al</em>. 2016). A somewhat different pattern occurs in Banco Chinchorro atoll where the population has adapted to local conditions. Females nest at the end of the dry season and hatching occurs during the middle of the wet season, thus representing a compromise between the risk of flooding and increasing the availability of freshwater for hatchlings (Charruau <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Most nest failures are attributed to predation, nest abandonment, desiccation, flooding, and low temperatures associated with heavy rainfall (Mazzotti 1989; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000b; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2010a). The American Crocodile is adept at using man-made areas for nesting, and this is one of the reasons behind population recovery in parts of its range (Mazzotti <em>et al</em>. 2007a, 2009; Ulloa Delgado 2012; McCann <em>et al</em>. 2016; Mazzotti <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;</p>  <p>Similar to most crocodilians, <em>C. acutus </em>is a dietary generalist that consumes a wide variety of prey such as invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2013a; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018a). In offshore, marine habitats of Belize, Mexico (Quintana Roo), and Panama, the diet consists largely of marine invertebrates, particularly various species of crabs, but also corals, gastropods, and bivalves (Platt <em>et al</em>., 2013a, Ávila Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2017; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018a). Fruit and vegetation are occasionally consumed by <em>C. acutus</em>, although the dietary significance of frugivory is poorly understood (Platt <em>et al</em>., 2013b, 2014b). <em>Crocodylus acutus</em> exhibits the typical ontogenetic dietary shift with smaller size-classes consuming mostly invertebrates and larger individuals taking increasing amounts of vertebrate prey (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2013a; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018a). &#160;</p>  <p>Studies on the population ecology of <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> have been carried out in Belize (Platt <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2004; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000a; Platt 2003; Rainwater and Platt 2009, 2013; Chenot-Rose and Rose 2013; Platt and Rainwater 2014, Tellez <em>et al</em>. 2016), Colombia (Balaguera-Reina and Gonzalez-Maya 2008; Ulloa Delgado 2011; Balaguera-Reina 2012; Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015b, 2016; Espinosa <em>et al</em>. 2012, Viloria-Largares <em>et al</em>. 2017), Costa Rica (Bolaños Montero, 2012; Mauger <em>et al</em>. 2012), Cuba (Rodríguez Soberón <em>et al</em>. 2002), Dominican Republic (Schubert 2002; Powell and Incháustegui 2009), Ecuador (Carvajal <em>et al</em>. 2005), Haiti (Thorbjarnarson 1988), Honduras (Espinal and Escobedo-Galván 2011), Jamaica (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012), Mexico (Cupul-Magaña <em>et al</em>. 2004; Charruau <em>et al</em>. 2005; Cedeño-Vázquez <em>et al</em>. 2006; Hernández-Hurtado <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2011; Brandon-Pliego 2007; García-Grajales <em>et al</em>. 2007; González Cortés 2007; Sigler 2011; Garcia-Grajales and Buenrostro-Silva 2017), Panama (Venegas-Anaya <em>et al</em>. 2015, Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018b), the United States (Florida) (Ogden 1978, Kushlan and Mazzotti 1989a,b; Moler 1991; Moler and Abercrombie 1992; Mazzotti <em>et al</em>. 2007b; Cherkiss <em>et al</em>. 2011; Green <em>et al</em>. 2014; Lorenz 2014; Briggs-Gonzalez&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2017), and Venezuela (Seijas 1988).</p>  <p>Recent genetic studies have confirmed that significant hybridization is occurring between <em>C. acutus </em>and <em>C. moreletii </em>in Belize (Hekkala 2004; Ray <em>et al</em>. 2004; Hekkala <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Mexico (Cedeño-Vázquez <em>et al. </em>2008; Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2008; Machkour-M’Rabet <em>et al</em>. 2009; Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2016) as well as with <em>C. rhombifer </em>in Cuba (Weaver <em>et al</em>. 2008; Milián-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015). The ecological and evolutionary consequences of this hybridization are poorly understood but are a priority for future work.</p><p></p>","<p>This species was hunted and overexploited for its hides in the 1930s until it was protected in the 1970s, however, illegal hunting still occurs. It is also threatened by habitat degradation from coastal development, including destruction of nesting grounds and the destruction of mangrove swamps for shrimp aquaculture. In the Dominican Republic, overharvesting of fish has contributed to the declines of this species (Ross 1998). When young, individuals of this species may also be predated by crabs, birds, raccoons, coaties, dogs, and by adult crocodiles (i.e., cannibalism). For a summary of the conservation and research actions receommended for this species, see the Conservation Actions section.<br/></p>","<p></p><p>The American Crocodile is found in 18 countries in the northern Neotropics (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). As <em>Crocodylus acutus </em>produces a commercially valuable skin, the principal reason for past declines in population size can be attributed to the extensive commercial overexploitation that occurred from the 1930s into the 1970s (Medem 1981, Thorbjarnarson 1989). The current threats are habitat loss and degradation, fishing nets, illegal hunting and hybridization. A review of the conservation status and distribution of <em>C. acutus </em>throughout its range conducted in the early 2000s (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006) concluded populations were recovering in most parts of its historic range. There were a few areas where population recovery appeared to be limited (e.g., Colombia), or non-existent (e.g., Ecuador), but populations of <em>C. acutus </em>in areas such as Cuba, USA, Mexico, and Costa Rica appear to be healthy and robust.</p>  <p>It was estimated that by 2002, <em>C. acutus </em>had been extirpated from 8.9% of its historical range (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, there is also evidence that the species is re-colonizing the one country from which it had been extirpated (Cayman Islands) with three individuals being sighted over a period of 12 months in 2008 and 2009 (Echternacht <em>et al.</em> 2011;&#160;M. DaCosta-Cottam, pers. comm. 2018). The review by Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>(2006) quantified the information available at the time and classified 69 areas in eight distinct crocodile bioregions as Crocodile Conservation Units (CCUs), defined as the most important areas for the conservation of <em>C. acutus</em>. The relative importance of the CCUs in each bioregion was quantified using an algorithm that weighted factors that experts on <em>C. acutus</em> considered to be most important for the long-term conservation of viable populations. In particular, two bioregions were identified where the creation of protected areas should be given a high priority: 1) Dry Pacific South America (northern Peru and southern Ecuador) and 2) Northwest and Central Pacific Mexico.</p>  <p><u><strong>North America</strong> </u></p>  <p>In the U.S.A., <em>C. acutus </em>is restricted to the southernmost, subtropical tip of the state of Florida. Since the 1970s, when it was first listed as Endangered under the US Endangered Species Act, the population has steadily increased (Mazzotti <em>et al. </em>2007a,b) and in 2007 <em>C. acutus</em> was officially reclassified as Threatened (Stansell 2007) reflecting the successful population recovery. Today, one of the most significant sources of mortality for crocodiles in Florida is road mortality (Brien <em>et al. </em>2008). In addition, a significant mortality event involving <em>C. acutus</em> occurred in Florida in 2010 as a result of an unprecedented period of cold weather (Mazzotti <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>Along the Pacific coast of Mexico,&#160;American crocodiles are found in areas of suitable habitat along the Pacific coast of Mexico from the Guatemalan border to the State of Sinaloa (Alvarez del Toro 1974, Sigler 2002, Muñiz 2004). Specific reports are available from&#160;the States of&#160;Jalisco (Huerta Ortega <em>et al. </em>2002; Cupul-Magaña <em>et al. </em>2002), Sinaloa (Navarro Serment 2003), and Oaxaca (Brandon-Pliego 2007). The three top priority CCUs in this bioregion were either coastal habitats characterized by relatively small mangrove areas that are typically associated with the mouths of rivers (Jalisco-Colima coast), or coastal lagoon/mangrove complexes with very seasonal inputs of freshwater (Bahía de Petacalco and&#160;Oaxaca coast) (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>2006). Crocodiles are widespread in these patchy habitats, with animals being found in 38 of 52 water bodies along the Jalisco coast (P. Ponce-Campos and S. Huerta-Ortega, pers. comm. 2018). Crocodiles are also known from inland reservoirs (Presa Adolfo López Mateos, also identified as CCU) as well as in freshwater sections of some of the region’s larger rivers (Rio Santiago CCU). Human-crocodile conflict is a growing problem in the Pacific region (Huerta Ortega and Ponce Campos 2002; Cupul-Magaña <em>et al.</em> 2010; García-Grajales and Buenrostro-Silva 2018, 2019). An initiative from the Mexican Government through the National Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) called “SOS crocodile” has identified a team in each region of the country to respond to incidents of human-crocodile conflict, gather information on the event, and take action to mitigate the problem (SEMARNAT 2018). Hybridization with non-native <em>C</em>. <em>moreletii</em> that became established after escaping from commercial crocodile farms potentially threatens the genetic integrity of <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> in some areas along the Pacific coast (Serrano-Gómez <em>et al</em>. 2016, Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2018). Along the Yucatan mainland of Mexico there is extensive hybridization between <em>C. moreletii </em>and <em>C. acutus </em>(Cedeño-Vázquez <em>et al. </em>2008; Rodriguez <em>et al. </em>2008; Machkour-M’Rabet <em>et al. </em>2009; Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2018), while the island populations on Cozumel and Banco Chinchorro remain genetically pure (Machkour-M’Rabet <em>et al. </em>2009, Pacheco-Sierra <em>et al</em>. 2016). An isolated population of <em>C. acutus </em>occurs in the Rio Grijalva, the only known Gulf of Mexico drainage where the species is present. In the Grijalva drainage, crocodiles inhabit a series of freshwater reservoirs, as well as riverine habitats between reservoirs (Sigler 2002, Mandujano Camacho 2003).</p>  <p>On the island of Hispaniola, a few small coastal populations of crocodiles were reported in Haiti by Thorbjarnarson (1988), but by far the largest populations were in two landlocked lakes, Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic and Etang Saumatre in Haiti. Lago Enriquillo is an unusual habitat, a hypersaline lake well below sea level, and crocodile populations have fluctuated widely since the 1980s as a result of changes in lake salinity and illegal hunting (Schubert and Santana 1996). Thorbjarnarson (1989) reported on the population in Etang Saumâtre in Haiti and some other coastal locations, but systematic surveys were last conducted in Haiti during the mid-1980s. More recent informal surveys indicate the population in Etang Saumatre is greatly reduced (A. Schubert, pers. comm. 2018).</p>  <p>Up until the late 2000s, American Crocodiles in Jamaica were reasonably abundant in areas along the southern coast. However, since that time coastal development appears to have destroyed many of the fragile wetland habitats and nesting areas used by crocodiles, and the situation regarding <em>C. acutus</em> in Jamaica now appears dire (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012). As of 2012, crocodiles remained in small numbers, widely distributed among small and isolated habitat patches primarily in the Black River Morass, central southern coast, and far eastern marshes and canals (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012). Crocodile numbers are declining due to continued habitat loss, persecution and illegal harvest for meat (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012). Real potential for the extirpation of <em>C. acutus</em> in Jamaica exists in the foreseeable future if current trends continue and more effective intervention is not developed (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>Populations of <em>C. acutus </em>in Cuba are widespread and locally abundant (Rodríguez Soberón <em>et al. </em>2006, Milián-García <em>et al.</em> 2018b). In 2007 Cuba became the first country to successfully petition CITES for a transfer of its <em>C. acutus </em>population to Appendix II, based on a program of managed use that includes ranching and closed-cycle captive breeding.</p>  <p><strong><u>Central America</u></strong></p>  <p>The American Crocodile in Belize is largely competitively excluded from inland, freshwater habitats by the sympatric <em>C</em>. <em>moreletii</em> and therefore restricted to the coastal zone (Platt and Thorbjarnarson 1997, 2000a,c). &#160;The most important populations are found on offshore islands, particularly the Turneffe and Lighthouse atolls (Platt <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2004; Platt and Thorbjarnarson 2000a; Platt 2003; Rainwater and Platt 2009, 2013; Chenot-Rose and Rose 2013; Platt and Rainwater 2014; Tellez and Boucher 2018). Hybridization between <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> and <em>C</em>. <em>moreletii</em> appears common along the coast of mainland Belize (Hekkala 2004, Ray <em>et al</em>. 2004, Hekkala <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>In the 1980s and 1990s,&#160;<em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em> populations were reported to be greatly depleted in Guatemala (Enrique Fernández, pers. comm. 2018) but there is little new information from this country. Crocodiles are similarly rare in El Salvador. Spotlight surveys by Escobedo-Galván <em>et al. </em>(2004) in some of the best remaining coastal habitats observed 28 crocodiles, mostly juveniles, over a total of 157.5 km (encounter rate = 0.17 crocodiles/km). In Honduras, most of the major rivers of the Atlantic drainage support small populations although most appear depleted (King <em>et al. </em>1990). Surveys by Cerrato (2002) in northern coastal Honduras in wetlands associated with the Laguna Guaimoreto, Rio Chapagua, Laguna El Lirio and the lower 15 km of the Rio Aguan reported a mean encounter rate of two crocodiles/km, which represents an increase from similar surveys conducted in the same area in 1989. Perhaps the largest crocodile population in Honduras is located in the El Cajon Reservoir where 1,082 crocodiles were counted including a large number of hatchlings (536) which confirms successful reproduction (Espinal 2005, Espinal and Escobedo-Galván 2011). Crocodiles are also known to be breeding in some of the Bay Islands off the northern coast of Honduras (Kaiser <em>et al. </em>2001).</p>  <p>Surveys in Nicaragua by King <em>et al. </em>(1994) reported <em>C. acutus </em>as rare but persisting in the Atlantic drainage while several viable populations were identified on the Pacific coast (Estero Real, Las Salinas) and near Managua. A similar conclusion was made by Buitrago (2000, 2001). Incidental illegal take of crocodiles in association with the legal caiman harvest is a problem (Buitrago 2001). In Costa Rica, a low density of crocodiles is found in wetlands along the Atlantic coast, although larger density populations are reported in mangroves swamps and rivers along the Pacific coast (Bolaños Montero 2012). A population of over 300 individuals was reported from the Rio Grande de Tarcoles (Sasa and Chaves 1992) and another of about 35 individuals in Estero Roto (Chaves Cordero 1993). Moderate encounter rates (crocodiles/km of survey route) were recorded in the Rio Chirripó at La Rambla de Sarapiquí (2.33), Golfo de Nicoya (1.93) and mangrove wetlands associated with the Terraba and Sierpe rivers (2.28) (Bolaños Montero <em>et al.</em> 1997). Substantial populations of crocodiles are also known from the Rio Tempisque (Sánchez 2001; Bolaños Montero, 2012) and the vicinity of the Osa Peninsula (Boston <em>et al. </em>2005) so it is likely that crocodiles occupying habitat patches along the Pacific coast function as a metapopulation (Porras 2007). Growing populations of crocodiles and people have resulted in several instances of human-crocodile conflict including fatal attacks (Ross and Larriera 2001; Bolaños Montero, 2012). In Panama, a long-term study on Coiba Island has revealed new information on the population genetics (Bashyal <em>et al</em>. 2014) as well as reproductive (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015), spatial (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2016), trophic (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018a), and population ecology (Venegas-Anaya <em>et al.</em> 2015,&#160;Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018b) of American Crocodiles inhabiting insular areas. An estimated population size of ~200 non-hatchlings on the southern tip of the island (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2018b) highlights the importance of Coiba Island as an American Crocodile hotspot and fertile locality for research on the natural history of the species.</p>  <p>In the regional analysis carried out by Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>(2006), the highest priority CCUs in the Caribbean drainage of Central America are three very different habitats: 1) an extensive region of eastern Nicaragua containing a vast complex of coastal lagoons and rivers that extend inland (Costa Miskito and Rio Coco), 2) a section of the largest lake in Central America (Lago de Nicaragua), and 3) a region of central Caribbean Panama that includes the enormous Gatun Lake Reservoir (Bahía de Panama-Este). The second level of priority CCUs is represented by a large river (Rio San Juan, Nicaragua), an extensive coastal lagoon complex (Laguna de Chiriqui, Panama) and a large reservoir (Embalse El Cajón, Honduras). Along the Pacific coast, the highest priority CCUs are patches of coastal mangrove and short sections of estuarine rivers. Puerto Sandino is a tidal mangrove complex that receives fresh water from the Izapa and Tamarindo Rivers. The Estero Real is the largest estuarine system of the Golfo de Fonseca and is in the driest region of Nicaragua, receiving less than 500 mm of rain annually. This CCU is comprised principally of a mangrove forest within which a number of commercial shrimp farms have been established, causing significant damage to the ecosystem. Isla Coiba in Panama is a national park comprised of 40 islands in Veraguas Province. There are also robust populations of <em>C. acutus </em>associated with rivers and coastal mangroves on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica (Rio Terraba, Rio Tempisque) that were rated at the second CCU priority level.</p>  <p><strong><u>South America</u></strong></p>  <p>American Crocodile numbers in Colombia are increasing and new populations have been discovered throughout the country. This facilitated the down-listing of the species from “Critically Endangered” to “Endangered” in the most recent local assessment (Morales-Betancourt <em>et al</em>. 2015). Healthy populations have been reported in Portete and Cispatá Bay, Puerto Badel (Arjona municipality), Dibulla, Tayrona Natural National Park, and in the Sardinata, San Miguel, Nuevo Presidente and Tibu rivers of the Caribbean region. However, a paucity of information still exists for areas such as the Pacific and Andean regions with only 37% of the national territories included in ecological studies during the last decade (Balaguera-Reina <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Community-based conservation programs in two areas of the Colombian Caribbean coast have provided the most detailed information on the conservation status of <em>C. acutus</em>. In the Cispatá Bay region (Ulloa Delgado 2004, 2005; Ulloa Delgado and Sierra Díaz 2002, 2006), a group of 15 ex-hunters, known as “caimaneros” are active participants in a program for the conservation of <em>C. acutus</em>. This community group formed ASOCAIMAN (Asociación para la Conservación de los Caimanes de la Bahía de Cispatá) with its main objective being the conservation of <em>C. acutus</em>. Aside from increasing the protection of crocodiles, the project has included the creation of artificial nesting beaches in the mangroves of Cispatá Bay and coupled with the head-starting of juvenile crocodiles. &#160;A somewhat similar community-based program to protect crocodiles, crocodile nests, and head-start crocodiles is underway in the Portete Bay in northeastern Colombia (Gómez <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160;In Venezuela, crocodiles are known from a number of coastal areas and river systems along the Caribbean coast. Restocking with ranched stock has been conducted in Falcon Province in the northeast of the country (Arteaga 1993; Velasco 2004; Velasco and Lander 1998) and in Aragua Province (Lander <em>et al</em>. 1994; Velasco 2004). These are the most important populations, with an active conservation program that includes surveys and monitoring. Comparative surveys between 1986 and 1993 suggest that populations in several locations are stable or growing as a result of protection and restocking, although residual problems of illegal killing for medicinal products is reported (Arteaga 1994). De Sola <em>et al. </em>(2004) and Lander and Bermudez (2005) reported on surveys around the Venezuelan coast and demonstrated that in some areas the status of populations have improved since previous surveys. Velasco <em>et al. </em>(2000) prepared a National Recovery Plan for <em>C. acutus</em> in Venezuela and Villarroel <em>et al. </em>(2005) presented the results of a workshop evaluating the Venezuelan <em>C. acutus </em>population and habitats, and proposed 11 CCUs for the country. All three highest priority CCUs along the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Colombia are coastal lagoon systems (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>2006). Two of the three proposed CCUs are mangrove systems in seasonally dry areas, one in Colombia (Alta Guajira, comprised of the Bahía Portete and Bahía Hondita), and one in Venezuela (Laguna Tacarigua). The Bahía Cispatá CCU is an extensive mangrove swamp associated with the old delta of the Rio Sinú. The second priority level of CCUs includes additional habitat types such as an inland, freshwater riverine site in dry forest habitat (Rio Bache, Colombia) over 1200 km from the coast, a coastal river/lagoon/reservoir complex (Yaracuy and Aroa rivers), as well a reservoir (Embalse Pueblo Viejo).</p>  <p>One of the areas where populations of <em>C. acutus </em>are most threatened is along the Pacific coast of South America. In Ecuador, crocodiles were formerly abundant in the Rio Guayas system but appear to have been all but extirpated (although population surveys are needed for confirmation). A small number of crocodiles remain in the coastal region of the Gulf of Guayaquil (Carvajal <em>et al. </em>2005; Carvajal and Alava 2005) but coastal mangrove destruction for the construction of shrimp aquaculture facilities is removing critical crocodile habitat. A small population remains in the Rio Tumbes region of northern Peru, at the southernmost limit of the species’ range (Trelancia 2001). Two areas were identified as CCUs (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al. </em>2006) with both associated with the Rio Tumbes drainage forming the geopolitical boundary between Peru and Ecuador. The Amotape CCU is a freshwater section of the Tumbes in a region of dry forest with few human pressures. The Estero Corrales is a tidal mangrove system associated with the Tumbes delta complex and adjacent to a protected area (Santuario de los Manglares) but nonetheless threatened by shrimp aquaculture and rice farming.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p>The American Crocodile is the most widely distributed of the New World crocodiles and&#160;found in 18 countries in the northern Neotropics (Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2006). Its range extends&#160;from the southern tip of Florida (USA), along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America, as well as the Caribbean islands of Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola (Groombridge 1987, Kushlan 1988, Thorbjarnarson <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;An isolated subpopulation is found in the Rio Grijalva basin in Mexico. Along the Pacific coast, it extends from northern Sinaloa in Mexico to the limits of mangrove coastal habitats in northern Peru.</p>","<p></p><p>As <em>C. acutus</em> produces a commercially valuable skin, there has been interest in commercial utilization programs. Commercial farms in Honduras and Colombia have been registered with CITES as captive breeding operations (one and seven, respectively). Commercial global exports of <em>C. acutus</em> skins have increased from 120 in 2006 to 3,403 in 2015 (Caldwell 2017). With the recent down-listing of its <em>C. acutus</em> population to CITES Appendix II, Cuba and Bahía Cispatá in Colombia are developing plans for exports based on commercial farming and ranching. Illegal hunting of this species still occurs for its hides in some regions but the conservation effects are most likely negligible.</p><p></p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><p>A review of the status and distribution of <em>C. acutus</em> throughout its range was carried out by Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. (2006) and found the species to be recovering in most parts of its historic range. There were a few areas where population recovery appears to be limited (e.g. Colombia), or non-existent (e.g. Ecuador), but populations of <em>C. acutus</em> in areas such as Cuba, the USA and Costa Rica appear to be very healthy.</p>  <p>There are management measures in place in all countries where this species occurs, with the exception of El Salvador and Haiti. However, enforcement of protection is lacking and urgently needed, since illegal hunting remains a threat (Ross 1998). There are protected areas and sanctuaries for this species as well as captive breeding programmes and a few commercial farming operations are established. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES in most range states, and Appendix II in Mexico, Cuba and the Cispatá Bay population in Colombia. Further research into the population, habitat requirements, and threats to this species should be carried out, and population monitoring is recommended.<br/></p><p><strong><u>High priority</u></strong></p>  <p>Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. (2006) listed a number of specific areas containing some of the most important populations of <em>C. acutus</em>,  and where greater habitat protection is needed. From this list, three  areas have been selected here as the highest priority for conservation  action.</p>  <p>1. <strong>Conservation in Peru and Ecuador</strong>: The Guayas River system in Ecuador historically supported a large population of <em>C. acutus</em>,  which appears to have all but disappeared following intensive  commercial hunting and habitat destruction in the 20th century. Surveys  are needed to determine if crocodiles still remain in the Guayas River,  and to develop population recovery plans. The small population in the  Tumbes area of northern Peru is also extremely vulnerable. Preliminary  studies suggest that the <em>C. acutus </em>in Ecuador/Peru are  genetically distinct from other populations (M. Anaya-Venegas, pers.  comm. 2018). Therefore, the genetic status of these populations merits  further investigation.</p>  <p>2. <strong>Population evaluation and conservation in the Magdalena/Cauca River basin</strong>:  Crocodiles are reported from several areas in the Magdalena/Cauca River  basin up to 1200 km from the coast. This area is considered a high  priority not only due to the lack of information and apparent endangered  population status, but also because of the extraordinary riverine  nature of the crocodiles. In a 2004 review by the CSG (Larriera <em>et al. </em>2005), the implementation of a national program for rebuilding depleted populations of <em>C. acutus </em>was  seen as a major priority and could be promoted by better linkage of  commercial crocodile farming operations in Colombia with <em>ex-situ </em>conservation efforts (Larriera <em>et al. </em>2005). However, these actions have not yet been carried out in Colombia, threatening the future of these populations.</p>  <p>3. <strong>Development of a conservation program in Jamaica</strong>:  American Crocodile numbers continue to decline in Jamaica due to  habitat loss, persecution, and illegal harvest for meat consumption  (Henriques <em>et al</em>. 2012). Extirpation of the species in the country is likely unless effective conservation measures are taken (Henriques <em>et al</em>.  2012). A continued nation-wide population evaluation, habitat  assessment, and monitoring and education program is needed as a  foundation towards developing a crocodile conservation plan for Jamaica.</p>  <p><strong><u>Moderate priority</u></strong></p>  <p>4. <strong>Genetic evaluations</strong>:  The American Crocodile is a wide-ranging and ecologically plastic  species. Genetic evidence to date suggests there are substantial genetic  differences among populations in different parts of the species’ range.  American Crocodiles are known to hybridize with <em>C. moreletii </em>and <em>C. rhombifer</em>; however, the evolutionary implications of this hybridization are poorly understood, and further investigation is warranted.</p>  <p>5.<strong> Population status in the Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Haiti</strong>: Recent information on the status of <em>C</em>. <em>acutus</em>  in the Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Haiti is sparse or  lacking. Crocodile surveys in these countries are needed to assess  population numbers, availability and quality of habitat, and current  threats so that appropriate conservation and management plans can be  developed.&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p>  6. <strong>Investigations on ecology and population biology</strong>:  Although the American Crocodile has been well-studied in certain areas  of its range, we still know relatively little about its ecology,  population dynamics and behaviour in the wild. Information on these and  other aspects of the life history of <em>C. acutus</em> (e.g., genetic  diversity, movement patterns, habitat use, physiology) would benefit the  overall management of the species and assist decision-makers dealing  with problem animals and human-crocodile conflict.<p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It is an anadromous species which undergoes seasonal annual migrations to freshwater to spawn. It does not appear to be overly common, and is considered rare in parts of its range.&#160;<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is a highly-valued food fish, and has been the subject of artificial breeding efforts in China and South Korea for the purposes of stock enhancement and in order to supply fish for human consumption. This species' dependence on freshwater systems to spawn and its predictable, seasonal mass spawning migrations into freshwater systems render it particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Habitat modification in estuaries is occurring in parts of its range and we infer that these events are contributing to population declines in parts of its range. Some authors have noted population declines in this species, which are currently unquantifiable. This high-value species occupies a shallow depth range (&lt;20 m) and undergoes mass-spawning migrations to freshwater systems, factors which render it particularly vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal areas as well as to overfishing.&#160;It is inferred that this species is dependent on fisheries management, such as off-fishing seasons, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, protected areas, and the increasing reliance on species-specific aquaculture to meet increasing consumer demand which can not be met by wild stocks alone.&#160;<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is conservation dependent and is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. Due to the economic importance of the <em>Takifugu</em> genus, and the prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological methods in addition to habitat and population monitoring.","<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is anadromous, migrating into freshwater rivers for reproduction during the spawning season. The newly hatched larvae remain in freshwater for several months before migrating back to the sea.

They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012).

Highly-effective fishing gear, including modified longlines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. ocellatus</span> are unknown it has been suggested that populations are declining due in part to over-fishing. It is likely that spawning aggregations of this species, which are found in freshwater, are intrinsically vulnerable to over-exploitation.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations<br/></span> Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Takifugu</span> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and overfishing</span><br/> Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/> This species is anadromous and breeds in freshwater. Several of its known breeding and feeding grounds, including the estuaries of the lower Yangtze river and several downstream lakes have recorded declines in fish biodiversity and shifts in species composition which have been attributed to anthropogenic habitat alteration, river modification (i.e. dam construction), overfishing, heavy metal pollution, deforestation and land erosion (Fu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Zhang<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008, Huang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Chen and Zhu 2008).

This species is also found in the ornamental aquarium trade.<em> Takifugu ocellatus</em>, like other fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K.

Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations, which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009).&#160;<strong></strong></p>  <br/><br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. ocellatus</em>,&#160;however, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. ocellatus</em>. Additionally,<em> T. ocellatus&#160;</em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p>      <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> can be found in both&#160; freshwater and marine  protected areas.

This corresponds  with the spawning migration of this species in China, although whether  or not this species spawns in the lake is unknown. Fishing has  also been banned for two months from June 1st to July 31st each year  since 1987 along the Xiajiang reach, Xingan reach, Jishui reach and Jian  reach of the Ganjiang River, where this species has been recorded; &#160;however, this does not correspond to the freshwater spawning migration  of this species (Huang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010).<br/>       </p><p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Although its Area of Occupancy (AOO) is 904 km<sup>2</sup>, considering its widespread locations (18) and Extent of Occurrence (EOO) (56071 km<sup>2</sup>), the species has been assessed as a Least Concern (LC) species.","<p><em>Dawkinsia singhala</em> is a tropical freshwater fish species and prefers fast flowing streams and rivulets that have a sandy substrate. They are also, however, recorded in still water bodies such as rock pools, swamps, tanks, and reservoirs (Pethiyagoda 1991, De Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015). This species can also tolerate the brackish conditions in estuaries and low lying swamps (Atputhanathan and Chitravadivelu 1968).</p>","<p>The habitat loss due to deforestation, agrochemicals and gem mining has been found to be a major threat to <em>Dawkinsia singhala</em>. These activities can cause erosion and surface run off resulting in loss of clear water conditions as well as sedimentation (i.e. replacement of preferred rocky substratum by mud and leaf litter) can make habitats less preferential to these species.&#160; <br/><br/>The population is known to be reduced due to introduction of the invasive species&#160;<em>O. mossambicus</em> and <em>O. niloticus</em>. These species are superior competitors and rapidly colonise habitats, driving many endemic and indigenous species into extinction (De Silva<em> et al</em>. 2015). It also identified that unsustainable local fishing in protected areas and harmful fishing practices such as use of dynamite and poisoning is harmful to the survival of this species. In addition, local extinction is also observed in the urban swamps due to high industrial water pollution.</p><p></p>","No population data is available regarding the population size or trend of this common species.

This rate of decline is matched by that reported under the Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme, which shows a steep decline since 2008. Threats from intensive agriculture, insecticides, hybridisation and ecological consequences for wild populations from contact with released birds are all documented to impact varying proportions of the wild global population. However, it is acknowledged that a significant and potentially more stable proportion of the population occurs on private land inaccessible to surveyors for these schemes in the species's core range in Spain.&#160;<br/><br/>As such, it is inferred that the rate of population reduction has approached the thresholds for listing as Vulnerable over the past ten years but is not, as yet, believed to have exceeded this threshold. The species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened, as nearly meeting the thresholds for Vulnerable under Criterion A2bcde +A3bcde + A4bcde.<br/><br/>It is important that there is greater collaboration between those monitoring the trend of the wild population and those involved in conserving sustainable populations to maintain the viability of hunting, to increase the precision of the trend estimate for future assessments.","The species is found in open habitats ranging from Mediterranean to humid temperate zones but not in boreal, oceanic or arid zones (Tucker and Heath 1994, McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2013). It prefers lowland areas and avoids forest and wet areas if possible. It uses habitats with a wide variety of soils and land uses including dry hilly land with scattered bushes up to about 1,300 m (occasionally up to 2,000 m) in montane foothills, inhospitable dry terrain on lower mountain slopes and marginal cultivation, cropland, orchards or woodland (McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2013). Over most of its range it is associated with arable farming, using low-intensity cropping with a mixture of cultivated, fallow and uncultivated ground (Tucker and Heath 1994). Laying dates vary between countries; April to early May in Portugal, late April to May in England and May to mid-June in France. The nest is a scrape in the ground lined with a few pieces of vegetation. Clutch sizes average 11.2–12.7 eggs. It feeds on seeds, leaves and roots with grasses and legumes particularly important in winter. It will also eat insects. The species is mostly sedentary but may descend to lower ground during the winter (McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The disappearance of uncultivated land due to changes in agricultural practice has resulted in the loss of nesting cover and chick food and is directly linked to rapid declines in farmland bird populations in Spain (Traba and Morales 2019). In pastoral areas, pastures have been agriculturally improved and areas of low, herb-rich scrub converted to grassland and further habitat loss has occurred through the loss of arable farming from open hill areas, if livestock are removed (leading to encroachment of tall scrub and forest) (Tucker and Heath 1994). Urbanization and agricultural expansion have also caused habitat fragmentation.&#160;<br/>Over-hunting is likely to have played a role in the decline of the species: over 60% of estimated potential population may be shot each year (McGowan and Kirwan 2013).The species status as a gamebird of high socioeconomic value means that there is a considerable effort to maintain a huntable surplus, which is eminently achievable with good habitat management: there is some evidence that hunting mortality is compensatory to natural mortality (Soucher <em>et al. </em>2018). One approach to achieving this has been to release captive-reared birds shortly prior to the hunting season, a practice that increased rapidly from the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Casas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016)&#160;and&#160;upwards of 3-6 million farm-bred partridges are now released annually (Díaz‐Fernández&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Ensuring hunting bag limits are sustainable is dependent on an accurate assessment of abundance prior to the season, but it was found that in intensive estates where large numbers of birds are released, harvest depended only on release intensity (Díaz‐Fernández&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The presence of released birds can also increases estimates from field assessments of abundance, but as their survival rate is very low (&lt;0.05 to the next spring: [Souchay&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018]) this adjustment results in larger numbers of 'wild' individuals (birds that have bred) being taken (Casas <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/>The actual stock that is released is also a threat: 63% of farmed birds had mtDNA lineages from Chukar (<em>A. chukar</em>), but more alarmingly so did 45% of wild Red-legged Partridges (Blanco-Aguiar <em>et al. </em>2008), potentially undermining the genetic distinctiveness of the species.&#160;<br/>Also illegal importations of <em>A. graeca</em> and <em>A. chukar</em> may also be causing problems through hybridization and competition (Tucker and Heath 1994,&#160;McGowan and Kirwan 2013).","The breeding population, which is confined to Europe,&#160;is estimated at&#160; 4,975,000-6,850,000&#160;pairs, which equates to 9,950,000-13,700,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).",Decreasing,"Red-legged Partridge is a western European endemic, resident in <strong>Spain </strong>(including the Balearic Islands), <strong>Portugal</strong>, <strong>France </strong>and extending into NW <strong>Italy </strong>and Corsica. The majority occur in Spain, where the population is estimated at 4,900,000 pairs (BirdLife International in prep.), Portugal is estimated to hold between 500,000 and 1,000,000 pairs, France between 130,000 and 300,000 pairs and Italy between 1,000-1,500 pairs (BirdLife International in prep.). Declines are considered to be occurring throughout.",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>EU Birds Directive Annex II and III. In 1993, the release of any <em>Alectoris</em> species other than <em>A. rufa</em> was discontinued in the U.K. (Tucker and Heath 1994). Most conservation actions implemented to increase densities are carried out by those engaged with hunting, most obviously through the retention of a large extent of land on which suitable habitat for the species is retained or enhanced, but also through generalist predator control and the provision of water sources and supplemental feeders (Arroyo 2012, Caro <em>et al.</em> 2014, Sánchez-García <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). These techniques can increase densities (Sánchez-García&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), although there appears to be a level of compensatory mortality or dispersal in the absence of hunting (Soucher <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The promotion of low-level agriculture in the lowlands and the maintenance of traditional farming practices in marginal hill areas should be put in place. Releases of other <em>Alectoris</em> species should be stopped in the rest of Europe. Sustainable hunting practices should be developed and adopted and promoted by hunting organisations and their members (Tucker and Heath 1994). Alternatives to large-scale releases of captive-bred Red-legged Partridge should be implemented where wild populations are present at expected densities, e.g. 2 pairs/km<sup>2</sup>. Stock that is released must be genetically certified as appropriate to the region of release. Release of any <em>Alectoris </em>should be subject to greater restriction, especially where large numbers are involved and the frequency of releases is high. Reared birds for release should be marked with closed rings to improve the monitoring of hunting mortality of the wild population.&#160;&#160;<br/>Collaborations between those managing hunting interests and those seeking improved conservation status should focus on shared ground in maintaining secure populations with sufficient surplus for hunting through developing regional management best practice and a centralised resource for monitoring wild populations.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
