It is apparently not listed in the Schedules of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (amended), though it may have been intended to be covered under Schedule I because tentoria and its subspecies were considered subspecies of <em>Pangshura tecta</em> at the time the law was implemented. Inclusion of <em>Pangshura tentoria</em> in one of the Schedules of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act should perhaps be considered (Appendix II).<br/><br/><em>Pangshura tentoria circumdata</em> has been recorded from Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh, India (Hanfee, 1999) and the Chambal River Sanctuary, while <em>P. t. flaviventer</em> occurs in probably all protected areas along the main stem of the Brahmaputra (P.

It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years), but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.</p>","<p>The Siberian Ibex&#160;primarily occupies mountainous regions from 500 to-5,500 m asl in rocky terrain and open alpine meadows and crags, seeking out lower elevations during the winter (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). In the completely snowed in valleys of the Himalaya, however, ibex remain in high elevations during winter to feed on emergent vegetation in the avalanche chutes and windblown crests, and also digging through softer snow of the higher elevations. They descend to the lower valley bottoms to take advantage of the spring thaw, but ascend to the highest ridgelines during the peak of summer (Schaller 1977, Bhatnagar 1997). Ibex occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. Siberian Ibex&#160;can also be found in areas with canyons, rocky outcrops, and steep ‘escape’ terrain far from high mountains (Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007, Peterson 2016, Bragin <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species rarely enters forest zones, but on a hot day does prefer shaded areas, or even small pockets of pastures near glaciers. Ibex tend to remain near steep, escape terrain (Bhatnagar 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Pin Valley National Park in India, over 90% of the over 800 ibex sightings were within 100 m from ‘escape terrain’ (Bhatnagar 1997). Females tend to retreat into the security of cliffs for parturition in May-June (Schaller 1977). </p>  <p>Ibex live in small groups that vary considerably in size, sometimes forming herds of over 100 animals, but more typically averaging 6-30 animals, depending on the region (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1997, 1999b; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Singh <em>et al. </em>2010). They spend the day in alternating periods of activity and rest, having a bimodal pattern through much of the year. In winter, ibex in the Himalaya tend to have a distinct unimodal activity peak towards noon, while resting on or near cliffs from evening until the next morning (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1992, Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). </p>  <p>Ibex shows little sexual segregation throughout the year, except the period between parturition (around June) and autumn (November) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex in an area of rocky outcrops in the Mongolian Gobi Desert displayed no segregation between sexes and similar sized mean annual home ranges using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) of 42 km<sup>2</sup> for females (n = 5) and 39 km<sup>2</sup> for males (n = 4) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study on ranging patterns of ibex in the Indian Himalaya (2 adult males and 3 females) shows that the mean annual home range (MCPs) of males (44 km<sup>2</sup>) was almost double that of females (20 km<sup>2</sup>) (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex used extremely small ranges on lower, south facing slopes with early sprout during the spring (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>), expanding to larger ranges in summer and autumn, but again confining to small ranges during winter (5-10 km<sup>2</sup>). Daily movements of ibex were highest during the summer flush when they traversed over a km during a day to take advantage of forage quality, but were confined to barely a 300-400 meters during winter and spring due to limited usable patches (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015).</p>  <p>Ibex are primarily grazers with herbs as well as subshrubs and shrubs such as <em>Eurotia sp</em>., <em>Rosa</em> sp. and <em>Ephedra sp.</em> contributing significantly to their diet (Manjrekar 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Bagchi <em>et al. </em>2004, Tumursukh 2015). </p>  <p>Females gestate for 170-180 days (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961) and usually give birth to one, sometimes two, kids in the spring. The animals reach sexual maturity at 18 months for females and 30 months for males, although usually only older males mate (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Siberian Ibex&#160;can live up to 16-17 years (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961, Fedosenko and Blank 2001).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Throughout its range, local people hunt ibex for subsistence use because they traditionally provide an important supplementary food for local people. Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations.<br/> <br/> In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted <em>Capra sibirica</em>. (Some hair fibers from <em>C. sibirica</em> are quite fine, and potentially may be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, specialty scarves. As of this writing (early 2020), the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from <em>C. sibirica</em>) had not yet been determined, but were still being advertised on the internet as coming from ibex, stating that annually 1500 kg of the wool are produced world-wide (www.acitac.com/materialien/faserkunde/yangir.html). This would require the harvest of a considerable number of animals. Domestic hunting might provide the raw material. Trophy hunting programs harvest only a few animals/year and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially marketed wool product. However, so far interest in ibex wool at local level is unknown and it seems Central Asia is not (yet) a supplier (Michel unpubl. data). If <em>Capra sibirica</em> were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened.<br/> <br/> In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Siberian Ibex&#160;are harvested in trophy hunting programs. Trophy hunting targets only males above a certain age, and so direct impacts on targeted population size likely remain negligible, but poorly regulated trophy hunting can have many negative consequences (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), including an effect on the sex and age composition of populations as reported from Kyrgyzstan (Michel and Rosen 2016). The potential of causing evolutionary effects is low as long as hunter harvest only a minor portion of the males. Bans on trophy hunting and importation of hunting trophies risk removing incentives to prevent poaching and might increase human-caused mortality of ibex.<br/> <br/> Climate change likely poses new threats by altering habitat quality, in particular affecting water availability, vegetation composition and phenology as well as causing changes in land-use. <br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, it seems that prior to the Soviet invasion, Siberian Ibex&#160;was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited, in some areas due to customary regulations (Michel unpubl. data, based information from traditional hunters 2009). Currently hunting is formally banned, but poaching is still a major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency, in particular where military personnel and other armed forces are involved. Poaching became of greater concern in Wakhan National Park (i.e. the district of Wakhan), where border guards and police presence has increased (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2019). <br/> <br/> In China, the species is classified as a Category I Protected Wild Animal Species under the Wild Animal Protection Law (Wang 1998). Poaching might now pose a minor threat, as the government has confiscated most guns from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.<br/> <br/> In India, region-wide threat assessments are scarce. Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2015) report illegal hunting by migratory laborers and migratory herders as one of the most important threats across the state of Himachal Pradesh, followed by subsistence hunting by local people and competition with migratory livestock for fodder. Increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993). Livestock grazing may not necessarily indicate competition, as was evident from summer grazing by local herders in Pin Valley; however, large herds of migratory herders were certainly a threat (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2000, Bagchi <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004). The fact that ibex can utilize rugged habitats have probably allowed them to linger precariously in parts of Himachal Pradesh with heavy grazing by migratory herds of livestock (Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>2015). The level of poaching is extremely low in the Buddhist dominated areas of India (Spiti and Ladakh). Heavy military presence along the disputed border between India and Pakistan can cause considerable disturbance to the species on both sides of the border, including the presence of border fencing. In fact, the ‘highest battlefield in the world’ around the Siachen glacier, contested between India and Pakistan, is surrounded by prime ibex habitat of the Karakorum, but is subjected to considerable military activity.</p>  <p>In Pakistan, poaching for food, heavy military presence on the Indian and Afghanistan borders, and competition for food with livestock are threats to Siberian Ibex. <br/> <br/> In Mongolia, transformation of ibex habitat for mining might be one of the most important emerging threats to the conservation of this species (see Tumursukh <em>et al.</em> 2015). The impact of trophy hunting on ibex populations remains uncertain (Lkhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other important threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali (<em>Ovis ammon</em>) by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively affect the species (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). A recent study by Odonjavkhlan (2018) did not find evidence for an impact of livestock grazing on habitat use by ibex in Tost Tosunbumba Nature Reserve. Tumursukh (2013) found evidence for competition between ibex and goats/sheep for forage; however, he did not find any evidence for demographic impacts from this competition. Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation. Harsh winter weather conditions can also severely affect population sizes locally (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is hunted by local people based on permit systems, but with a large unreported and illegal take. Informal hunting still seems to exceed official quotas in these countries, although the quotas for domestic hunters have not always appeared sustainable. Kyrgyzstan since 2017 has applied temporary hunting moratoria in several provinces, the effect of which is not yet evident.<br/> <br/> In Russia, although hunted legally under license, many are shot illegally and in large numbers.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>No rigorously derived population estimates exist for Siberian Ibex&#160;in any range state, although Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Lkhagvasuren <em>et al. </em>(2016) provide population estimates for most of Mongolia in 2009. Thus, the total population number provided here is a rough guess. Summarizing all available guestimates for the range states the total population size likely would be in the range of 170,000 to 250,000 animals (102,000 to 150,000 mature individuals).<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, the Siberian Ibex&#160;was considered abundant throughout its range prior to the late 1970s and a series of wars. Shank <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1977) estimated that around 5,000 animals used the Ajar Valley Reserve seasonally during the 1970s; this population is likely much smaller now (C. Shank pers. comm. 2007). More than 4,000 were believed to inhabit the Pamir alone. Their present status in the Pamir is unknown, but they are known to persist in reasonably large numbers throughout the ranges of the Wakhan Corridor. There in 2011 WCS recorded 2,069 animals in a direct count (1.6 per km²); in 2015, the double observer method yielded an estimate of 740 ±226 (2.2 per km²) (Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017)<span lang=""EN-US""> and 753 ±267 (2.2 per km²) in 2018 (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2020). The Siberian Ibex&#160;occurs along the Panj River across most of Badakhshan Province, but in some districts is exposed to illegal overhunting and population numbers are unknown (Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> There is no overall population estimate in China. The population in the Tian Shan had been guessed at 40,000-50,000 individuals (Wang 1998). Wu <em>et al. </em>(2015) estimate a density of 1.54 (± 0.23) per km² in the Tien Shan mountains south of Urumqi. Densities in other areas are relatively low. Rough guesses of ibex numbers in the Bei Mountains (northern Gansu) are between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals. The species has almost disappeared in the Daqin Mountains (Gao <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is listed as “Endangered” in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals (Wang 1998).<br/> <br/> In India, earlier population estimates include a minimum of 6,000 in Ladakh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1991a) and perhaps another 4,000 on the south side of the main Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and in the Pir Panjal range of Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1992). A total of up to 15,000 ibex was estimated by Johnsingh, Mishra and Bhatnagar (1997) in <em>ca</em> 40,000 km² of potential habitat based on rough extrapolations. Counts of ibex in protected areas include 330 in the Kanji-Boodkharbu, 225 in Lungnag, 250 in Rangdum, and 174 in Rizong Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir) (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a), and 174 in the Pin Valley National Park (Himachal Pradesh) where Pandey (1993) estimated a density of 2.3 ibex/km² in 1989 and Johnsingh <em>et al.</em> (1997) at a lower value of 1.2 ibex/km². More recently Suryawanshi <em>et al.</em> (2012) estimate a density of 0.37 ibex/km² or 184 (± 40) ibex in 497 km² in Pin Valley National Park; a density of 0.11 ibex/km or 45 (±13) in 411 km² of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary and a density of 0.14 ibex/km² or 30 (±14) in 219 km² of Lossar area of Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Over the past 10 years, these populations have been monitored using similar protocol and the population trends are stable (Suryawanshi, unpublished data). A recent occupancy survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2017) across the state of Himachal Pradesh found that ibex occupy an estimated 8,915 km². They found no evidence of range expansion or contraction in the Himachal Pradesh region between 1992 and 2015. Given these figures, we suspect that total population might not be more than 15,000.<br/> <br/> As reported by Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997), the total number of ibex in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia (as well as in adjacent Russia) was estimated at between 100,000 to 110,000 animals. Most of these occurred in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (<em>ca</em> 70,000) and Kazakhstan (ca. 17,000) with far fewer (8,000 to 9,000) in southern Siberia (3,000 to 3,500 in the Altai, 2,500 in Tannu Ola mountains of Tuva, 1,500 in Western Sayan and 2,000 to 2,500 in Eastern Sayan) and Uzbekistan (2,400). In Kazakhstan, the official numbers reported by the Provincial Territorial Inspection Services for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture (A. Muzbay pers. comm. 2019) during the period 2014-2018 varied between 16,582 and 22,700 (average 20,500). These variations may reflect differences in reporting or methods rather than actual fluctuations of the population size. In Kyrgyzstan, officially reported numbers for the years 2000 – 2013 vary between 34,000 in 2009 and 73,000 in 2000, and are not always fully consistent (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019); the most recent official figure was 41,463 in 2018 (Press Service of the State Agency on Forestry and Environmental Protection, 2019 quoted at https://eco.akipress.org/news:1562027). The abundance varies. There are hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Ala-Arch National Park and Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) with high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low. The population size in the Pamirs and Pamiro-Alay in Tajikistan are unknown, but the species was considered common, especially in the western part of the Pamirs (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers had declined during and after the civil war in Tajikistan in the 1990s and recovered only locally. The total potentially suitable area in Tajikistan is approx. 70,000 km²; if applying the lower density margin (0.2/km²) from the site estimates below the total ibex population size might be 14,000 animals (own guess Michel, 2019). Considering that large areas are intensively used for grazing and poaching impact has reduced population sizes, this figure might be more realistic than higher estimates of up to 25,000 (Kh. Karimov pers. comm. 2019). In Uzbekistan, the population might still be in the range of 2,000-2,500 animals, although the southern part of the Hissar Range in Surkhandarya Province has not been surveyed for the last two decades (E. Bykova pers. comm. 2019). Thus, despite local declines the overall population size seems to be still similar as reported in Shackleton (1997) with no detectable overall trend, but possibly declines at least in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, it is not clear if this apparently stable or slightly declining population size reflects the real situation or continuity in formal reporting by state agencies and hunting organizations. The continuing prevalence of poaching across Central Asia combined with an increase in the intensity and area covered by livestock grazing in mountainous rangelands over the last two decades leads us to suspect an overall more substantial decline in population size than reflected in official numbers. This suspected decline is also supported by site-level estimates in areas with different management regimes </p>  <p>Few site level estimates exist for the Central Asia region. Jumabay-Uulu (2013) estimated a density of 0.67 ibex/km² in 1,341 km² of Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan. Recent surveys (2018) by Khanyari (unpublished data) using the double-observer survey method put the estimates in this area at 2.26 ibex/km². Numbers in community-based conservancies in the Bartang valley, Wakhan and Northern Alichur range of Tajikistan have been stable or increasing between 2009 and 2019 with densities varying between 0.19 and 1.42 animals per km² conservancy area and an absolute number of up to 2,300 over an area of 2,250 km² (unpublished data of ANCOT, 2019). Michel and Muratov (2010) reported direct counts of 2,476 animals in 8,174 km² surveyed area of the eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan (0.30 ibex per km² surveyed area with substantial variation between areas). Point counts in two sections of this area in 2013 yielded estimates of 0.34 animals per km² in an unmanaged area and 0.57 animals per km² in a game management area (unpublished analysis of data of ANCOT by Michel).&#160; <br/> <br/> The Mongolian Red Data Book 1987 (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987), stated that 1,000 individuals inhabited western Khövsgöl alone, and a total of 80,000 animals occurred in Mongolia in the mid-1980s (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) stated that ibex numbers declined since that peak estimate of 80,000 due to exploitation, habitat degradation and competition for resources (Schaller 1994, 1995, 1998). Lkhagvasuren et al. (2016) estimated a total of 36,018 (13,840–43,873) ibex across Mongolia. This is much lower than the 80,000 ibex estimated in mid-1980s. In the Khohk Serkh Reserve in the High Altai, the population was estimated at 1,000 in 1979 by Dzieciolowski <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1980) and at 1,200 by des Clers (1985). Tulgat and Schaller (1992) estimated 600 ibex in the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area. In 1989, in a 200 km² study area west of Tsogt in the Altai, Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1994) counted 337 ibex, and estimated there may have been a total of up to 450 animals. Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) recorded 1,218 ibex in 623 km² of Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Conservation Park (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999b). Tumursukh <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate a density of 0.75 ibex/km² or 1,051 (±196) in 1,400 km² of the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, which were later declared Tost-Tosumbumba Nature Reserve. Few other rigorously derived estimates of population numbers exist for other parts of Mongolia. <br/> <br/> Siberian Ibex&#160;is widely distributed over northern Pakistan, but is only locally abundant in the northern part of the country. Hess (1986) found the highest density in northern Pakistan to be in the area along the Barpu Glacier (Gilgit District) with 1.2 to 1.6 animals/km² (n = 194-270 animals, area surveyed = 164 km<sup>2</sup>). Wegge (1988) estimated that &gt;2,000 ibex lived in the Khunjerab NP, at a slightly lower density of <em>ca</em> 1.0 ibex/km². In many areas the species had densities of only 0.1 to 0.3/km² as in the Shinghai Valley, Gilgit District (n = 15-50 animals, area surveyed = 176 km², Hess, 1986). Within the Gilgit District, Siberian ibex was clearly rarer in the southern than in the northern part. The reasons for this may be that compared to northern areas, elevations in the south are generally lower, there are higher densities of humans using alpine pastures, and there are smaller distances between villages. The census of the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1992) gives 2,545 animals for the whole province; in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 375 were estimated (Qayyum, 1986, 87). Recent surveys by Khan <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a total of 899 ibex in a survey area of 1,895 km² of Khunjerab National Park. They encountered the highest densities of ibex in the Muztagh-Taxkorgan region with an estimated 1.17 ibex per km²<sub>. </sub>Din <sub>et al</sub>. (2011) counted 429 ibex in 1,022 km² of northern Chitral (Torkhow valley). Rahman and Din (2016) in Chipursan Valley (Hunza) recorded 2,085 ibex (0.26/km²). Ali <em>et al</em>. (2007) counted 122 ibex in the Neelum Valley of Azad Kashmir. During 2010-2011 in Nagar Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan Ali <em>et al</em>. (2015) counted 478 in winter and 456 in spring, leading to density estimates of 0.33 and 0.32 per km² respectively. Khan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported 2,777 ibexes from the whole of Gilgit Baltistan, while annual surveys of ibex in central Karakoram National Park suggest numbers to be around 2,500 ibex.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species inhabits the mountain ranges, isolated mountains, and rocky outcrops of central and northeastern Afghanistan, China (northwestern tip of Gansu, western Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, possibly Tibet on its border with Xinjiang, Schaller 1998), northwestern India (Himalaya of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh), southern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia (Altai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, and Sayan Mountains, as well as in the southeast), northern Pakistan, Russia (southern Siberia, southern Tuva, and the Altai Mountains), Tajikistan and northeastern Uzbekistan (west Tian Shan) (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005, Harris <em>et al. </em>2009). </p>  <p>In Afghanistan, Siberian Ibex were historically found in steep habitat throughout the Afghan Hindu Kush and its outlying ranges (e.g., Spinghar, Kohe Baba, Safed Koh, Feroz Koh, Nuristan), but current distribution is not known. Its occurrence has been confirmed since 2000 in suitable habitat throughout the Afghan Pamir and along the Panj River of north-eastern Badakhshan, in particular in Wakhan, Ishkashem, Zebak, Rushan and Darvaz districts (Simms et al. 2014, Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017, Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> In China, Siberian Ibex occur primarily in the mountains surrounding Xinjiang, but also in those of extreme northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Populations are relatively widespread in western Xinjiang (Abudoukadi’er 2003) in the mountains around the Dzungarian Basin, including the mountains along the border with Kazakhstan from south of the Irtysh River, through the Kok Shaal Tau Mountains along the border with Kyrgyzstan and into the Pamir along the border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also throughout the Tian Shan ranges. Populations occur along the Sino-Mongolia border in the Baytik Mountains (Xinjiang), in the Mazongshan area of northern Gansu, and as far east as the Daqinshan of central Inner Mongolia (Wang 1998). Slightly separated from these are populations in the Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang, along China’s borders with Mongolia, and Russia. <br/> <br/> The Siberian Ibex has a widespread distribution in northeastern and eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and southern Siberia, where it occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from hot deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. It is found throughout the ranges of the Pamiro-Alay, Pamir, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Altai, and Tuva Mountains, as well as the western and eastern Sayan (Weinberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Fedosenko 2001). The species occurs in mountainous areas with sufficient rugged escape terrain and suitable pockets of grazing habitat, but is missing in the wide mountain valleys and plateaus intensively used for livestock grazing.<br/> <br/> In Mongolia, Siberian Ibex are patchily distributed in rugged terrain throughout the western half of the country, and in central and south-central Mongolia to the trans-Siberian railway line (Ulaanbaatar to Sainshand) (Dulamtseren 1970, 1977; Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). More specifically, ibex inhabit the Altai, Hangai, and Gobi Altai Mountain Ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Mallon 1985, Schaller 1994, Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). They also occur in the Sayan Mountains near the Russian border west of Lake Hovsgol and in scattered populations in the small mountains in the Transaltai Gobi and in canyons, rocky outcrops, and other rugged terrain throughout the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1977; Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1999a, 1999b; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). A small, introduced population survives in the Bogd Uul Mountains just outside of Ulaanbaatar (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The largest number of ibex occurs in the Altai and western Hangai Mountains (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Populations continue to become increasingly fragmented, especially in central and southeastern Mongolia (Schaller 1994, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). A long-term research project on ibex ecology is being conducted in northern Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in northern Dornogobi Aimag (Reading <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006b, 2007; Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Peterson 2016; Bragin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; Otgonbayar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/> <br/> In India, the Siberian Ibex occurs in the Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir, in the Karakorum, Zanskar and Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and in the Trans Himalayan and Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh, as far east as the Sutlej river (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992; Gaston <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1981; Pandey 1993). The species occurs in the western half of Ladakh, in the Shyok Valley (Nubra region) of northern Ladakh, along the Ladakh Range, and along both sides of the main Himalayan Range eastward to Shingo La (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a, 1992; Mallon 1991; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Its occurrence is very sparse east of the Zanskar River, a tributary of the Indus. It is present along the southern side of the Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir from the Zoji La eastwards to Himachal Pradesh, where it occurs throughout much of Lahul and Spiti, in the upper Beas and Parbati catchments, and Kinnaur in the east, primarily on the right bank of the Sutlej river (Fox <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1992; Pandey 1993; Bhatnagar 2003; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015; Ghoshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In&#160; Pakistan,&#160; the population of Himalayan Ibex&#160;is currently concentrated within the Karakoram Range, especially in the Districts of Hunza (Gojal Valley), Nagar (Hopper and Hisper), Shigar (Basha and Braldu) and Ghanche (Hushey and Kandey) (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015; Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In the Hindu Kush Range, the largest and most stable population occurs in Qurumber National Park and its buffer areas (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In the Himalayas, ibex habitat is shrinking overall; currently it is confined to Shouter Valley of Neelum Valley within the range that was reported for ibex in Pakistani Kashmir (Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Among the valleys of Gilgit-Balitstan that fall in the Himalayas, ibex exist in the Rupal, Rattu and Darley Valleys of Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan. In the Hindu Kush Range, the ibex survives in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the upper Chitral District. It is restricted to the relatively dry mountains between about 3,200 to greater than 5,000 m.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Siberian Ibex are harvested by subsistence hunters for their meat and by trophy hunters primarily for their skulls with horns sometimes also the entire skin. Locally the fur is used to produce high-end wool, called “yangir”, but the extent of this use is not known.",Terrestrial,"<p>Within Afghanistan, ibex are nominally protected from human harvest by a nationwide presidential ban on hunting. Ibex populations residing in the Ajar valley (in Bamyan Province) were listed by the Government’s National Environmental Protection Agency as legally protected in 2009, formally banning all hunting and trading of animals from this population within Afghanistan. They are present in the Wakhan National Park (declared in 2014), and the Bamyan Plateau protected area (declared in 2019), which incorporates the Ajar Valley. They are probably very few left in Band-e-Amir National Park (declared in 2009) and their status in Shah Foladi protected area (declared in 2019) is unknown. Conservation measures proposed include surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species.<br/> <br/> In China, the taxon is listed as Class I in the Wildlife Protection Law. Siberian ibex occur in at least eight nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Khanasi and Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), Tuomur Feng, Bogda Feng, Tianchi, West Tian Shan, and Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). Conservation measures proposed include determining the status of populations throughout their distribution in China, providing additional protection in some areas (e.g., in the Altai), considering others for development of managed, sustainable trophy hunting programs. These latter programs may be useful where ibex numbers are sufficiently abundant, and where removal or reduction of livestock is advised, local people should be provided with compensation. In northern Gansu, livestock should be managed to reduce conflicts with <em>C. sibirica</em>. It has also been suggested that a cross-boundary reserve be developed that would connect to the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia, not only to protect ibex but also other species.<br/> <br/> In India, the Project Snow Leopard, a national level policy for conservation in high elevation area promotes landscape scale participatory approaches within multi-use landscape (PSL 2008). Such a policy facilitates working with local communities to reduce impacts of livestock grazing and illegal hunting on wildlife in the region through the implementation of carefully developed management plans. Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2015) corroborate this by finding that most of the wildlife (including ibex) occur outside protected areas in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Siberian ibex is found in several protected areas in the western Himalayan region (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991a, 1994; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Bhatnagar 2003) including: Jammu and Kashmir (undivided) – Kishtwar and Hemis National Parks and Batkal Thajwas, Overa Aru, Kanji, Boodkharbu, Tongri, Rangdum, Karakoram, Lung Nag, Rizong Sabu, and Chukor Wildlife Sanctuaries; Himachal Pradesh - Pin Valley and Great Himalayan (possibly) National Parks and the Daranghati (possibly), Gamgul Siya-Behi, Kanawar, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Manali, Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/> <br/> Within ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia ibex are present in several strictly protected areas (<em>zapovedniks</em>) and National Parks. Among these are important areas: Kazakhstan: Aksu-Dzhabagly, Alma-Ata and Markakol, Altyn-Emel National Park; Kyrgyzstan: Besh-Aral, Naryn, Sarychat-Ertash and Sary-Chelek, Ala-Archa National Park, Khan-Tengri National Park; Russia: Sayano-Shushensky and Altai; Tajikistan: Romit, Zorkul, Tajik National Park; Uzbekistan: Chatkal, Gissar and Zaamin, Ugam-Chatkal National Park, Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserve. Hunting by domestic hunters based on permits and hunting seasons exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and in few hunting areas in Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting for ibex exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting can be important for conserving the species, as it can provide incentives to prevent poaching, but usually only if implemented as community-based programs. Most such operations in the former Soviet Union involve former poachers and the income they provide encourages these people to refrain from poaching and to prevent others from poaching (Michel and Rosen 2016). Bans of trophy hunting as proposed in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and 2019 or prohibition of trophy imports would remove such incentives and could result in higher mortality from unregulated illegal use. In Kyrgyzstan (since 2010) and Tajikistan (since 2008) community-based game management led to local recoveries of ibex numbers (Michel and Rosen 2016) in areas where previously poaching had reduced population sizes to low levels (SULi 2019). For instance, in Tajikistan 4 such game management areas with a total area 2,250 km² harbor about 2,300 animals with further community-based areas under development. Hunting and tourism revenues finance the management of these areas, managed by local NGOs created mainly by former poachers. Also in Kyrgyzstan, on several thousand square kilometers community-based organizations prevent poaching and thus support ibex conservation, although so far hunting quotas have not been assigned in any of these areas. Conservation measures proposed include the expansion of community-based hunting management and protection and the increase of protected areas effectiveness with a focus on stopping poaching and regulation of livestock grazing to prevent forage competition and habitat degradation. </p>  <p>In Mongolia, ibex is legally protected as a Rare species under the Mongolian Law on Fauna and the Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). No general hunting is allowed, but a limited amount of licensed trophy hunting is permitted. The species is listed as Near Threatened in most recent Mongolian Red List (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006), which represents a change in status from the last 2 Mongolian Red Books, in which the species was listed as Threatened (Shagdarsuren 1987; Shiirevdamba <em>et al</em>. 1997). Approximately 14% of the species’ range is protected (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006) and it occurs in at least the following protected areas: Altai-Taivan Bogd, Bodgkhan Mountains, Eej Khairkhan Mountain, Great Gobi, Gobi Gurvan Saikhan, Ikh Nart, Khangai Nuruu, Khar-Uvs Lake, Khokh Serkh Mountain, Khovsgol Lake, Otgontenger Mountain, Sharga Natural Reserve, Silkhem Mountain, Tarvagatai Mountain, Tost Mountains, Tsambagarav, Uvs Lake, and Yoliin Valley. Khokh Serkh Nature Reserve in the Altai region was established specifically for the conservation of this species. A long-term research project on ibex in Ikh Nart has been established for several years now, and several hundred are estimated to be living within this protected area (R. Reading pers. comm.). Conservation measures proposed include: 1) Undertake more rigorous population surveys of all populations; 2) Study the ecology, particularly habitat requirements and movement patterns, and the impacts of livestock grazing on ibex; 3) Hire, train, and equip law enforcement agents, especially for protected areas; 4) Begin using the money generated from trophy hunting to pay for conservation and management of the species, ideally using community-based approaches (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016); 5) Establish new protected areas to conserve additional populations of ibex; and 6) Collaborate better with Russia and China to protect populations that live in border regions. Trophy hunters purchase hunting licenses from which US$800 for Altai ibex and UD$720 for Gobi ibex are theoretically allocated to the government for a quota of 260 animals per year (MNE 2005). Little to none of this money is used specifically for conservation or management of the species (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), although a small percentage of the money goes toward general conservation activities, such as the budgets of regional protected areas administrations. <br/> <br/> Within Pakistan, Shackleton (1997) reported numerous protected areas providing differing levels of protection to ibex. These include: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Agram-Basti Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Goleen Gol Game Reserve (GR); Swat District: Giddar Baik WS, Mahu Dand GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan - Gilgit District: Khunjerab NP, Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Kilik-Mintaka GR, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR, Pakura Nallah GR, Chassi-Bowshdar GR, Nazbar Nallah GR (Rasool no date); Diamir District: Astor WS (Rasool n. d.); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Satpara WS, Nar Nallah GR, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir – Muzaffarabad District: Ghamot GR, Machiara GR (Qayyum 1986, 1987; Zool. Survey Dept. 1986). Mahu Dand GR was created for ibex in 1992. WWF-Pakistan began a hunting program in 1990 at the Bar village near Gilgit (Johnson 1997, Arshad 2002). In 1991, IUCN-Pakistan, with support from UNDP, in co-operation with local people and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, initiated a planning process to survey protected areas and to prepare an overall sustainable-use wildlife management plan for ibex populations. The program involves hunting by both local and foreign hunters. Conservation measures include: 1) Provide complete legal protection for the species and 2) Establish a proper hunting system involving a management plan for locals, as well as for foreigners. Hunting occurs in areas with healthy populations. This trophy hunting program has benefited the ibex population in Pakistan, and helped many populations to recover in several valleys of northern Pakistan (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

45226918,12246,Lobodon carcinophaga,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its widespread occurrence and very large population size, the Crabeater Seal should remain classified by IUCN as Least Concern.","Adult Crabeater Seals reach 2.6 m in length and weigh an estimated 200-300 kg. Neonates are thought to be at least 1.1 m and 20-40 kg. The mean age of sexual maturity in females varies from 2.5 to 4.2 years and these variations may be related to changes in food abundance (Bengtson and Laws 1985,&#160;Hårding and Härkönen 1995). Annual adult mortality is about 3-10% (Boveng 1993). Crabeater Seal births occur mainly during the second half of October. They do not use specific rookeries. Instead, adult females haul out singly on an ice floe where they give birth, and they are joined by a male shortly after (Siniff <em>et al</em>. 1979, Adam 2005). Adult males attend female-pup pairs and stay with the female until her oestrous begins one to two weeks after the pup is weaned. Mating has not been witnessed and presumably occurs in the water.<br/><br/>Pups are born from September to December (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2003) in a soft woolly coat that is greyish-brown in colour and has been described as light, milk coffee brown, with darker colouring on the flippers. Adult females fast during lactation, and wean their pups after an average of three weeks (Southwell 2004, Adam 2005) at which time pups are moulting from the lanugo coat into a sub-adult pelage similar to that of the adult. Adults and subadults moult in January and February, and a large proportion of the animals in an area are thought to be hauled out during the annual moult.<br/><br/>Mortality is high in the first year, possibly reaching 80%. Much of this mortality is attributed to Leopard Seal predation, and up to 78% of Crabeaters that survive through their first year have injuries and scars from Leopard Seal attacks (Siniff and Bengtson 1997). The presence of long scars and sets of parallel scars that are readily visible on the pale, relatively unmarked pelage of Crabeaters, are testimony to the frequency of these attacks on young of this species. Leopard Seal attacks appear to fall off dramatically after Crabeaters reach one year of age (Siniff and Stone 1985).<br/><br/>Recent research has revealed that Crabeater Seals can dive up to 600 m and stay submerged for 24 minutes, although most feeding dives occur within the top 50 m, and are shorter in duration (Burns <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008). Foraging occurs primarily at night (Bengtson and Stewart 1992), and instrumented seals have been recorded to dive continuously for periods up to 16 hours. Dives at dawn and dusk are deeper than at night, and indicate that Crabeater feeding activity is also tied to the daily vertical migrations of Krill. They have a general pattern of feeding from dusk until dawn, and hauling-out in the middle of the day.<br/>Crabeater Seals feed primarily on Antarctic Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>, which accounts for over 90% of their diet, with the remainder made up of fish and squid. New information indicates that the diet composition of the Crabeater Seal can display some plasticity, and they can compensate when Krill availability decreases by incorporating more fish (&gt;25% of their diet; Hückstädt <em>et al</em>. 2012). All of the post-canine teeth are ornate, with multiple accessory cusps that interlock to form a network for straining Krill from the seawater. A ridge of bone on each mandible fills the gap in the mouth behind the last upper post-canine teeth and the back of the jaw, which helps prevent the loss of Krill from the mouth when feeding.<br/><br/>Crabeater Seals are frequently encountered alone or in small groups of up to three on the ice or in the water. Much larger groups of up to 1,000 hauled-out together have been observed. They can be seen swimming together in herds estimated to be up to 500 animals, breathing and diving almost synchronously.","There are currently no direct threats from human activity throughout most of the species’ normal range.<br/><br/>A mass die-off of Crabeater Seals was reported from an area near a research base on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1955 (Laws and Taylor 1957). About 3,000 animals were trapped in areas five to 25 km from open water and most died over a two to three month period. None of the animals examined appeared to be starving, and numerous abortions of foetuses were noted. A disease outbreak was suspected, but never identified. Antibodies to canine distemper virus were found in Crabeater Seals from this area in 1989 (Bengtson <em>et al.</em> 1991).<br/><br/>The effects of global climate change on Antarctic seals are unknown. Learmonth <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggest that Crabeater Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. Loss of sufficient areas of pack ice habitat used for pupping, resting, avoidance of predators, and access to preferred foraging areas because of changes from warming could lead to population declines. The loss of sea ice has the potential to negatively impact Crabeater Seals given their high level of specialization on Antarctic Krill. Sea ice coverage is of particular importance for the survival of juvenile stages of Krill, and ultimately determines the biomass of adult Krill that is available for higher trophic level predators. It is unclear whether Crabeater Seals might be able to switch from their highly specialized, Krill-based diet, to a more generalist strategy with rapid loss of sea ice. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rise, on Antarctic Ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as seals are unknown.<br/><br/>Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessel passage, and close approach by people in small boats and on land on Crabeater Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is a small risk of injury to animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessel passage through ice fields.<br/><br/>There are no reports of significant interactions between Crabeater Seals and fisheries. Commercial harvest of Krill may pose a threat to Crabeater Seals, if it ever becomes established at a large scale.","The Crabeater Seal is a widespread species, and, as is the case for other Seals inhabiting the&#160;Antarctic&#160;pack ice, population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore infrequently undertaken. Published global population estimates range from two million (Scheffer 1958) up to 50-75 million animals (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 1971). However, early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. The most recent available data, obtained during the multi-national effort conducted under the umbrella of the Antarctic Pack Ice Seal program in the late 1990s, provided a population size estimate of approximately 8,000,000 animals for the area surveyed (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). Considering that major areas of the pack ice around the continent were not surveyed, there is a large uncertainty regarding the actual population size of the species. Yet, Crabeater Seals are considered to be one of the most abundant seal species (if not the most abundant) and one of the most numerous large mammals on Earth.",Unknown,"The distribution of Crabeater Seals is tied to seasonal fluctuations of the pack ice. They can be found right up to the coast and ice shelves of Antarctica, as far south as the Bay of Whales (Lindsey 1938), during late summer ice break-up. They occur in greatest numbers in the seasonally shifting pack ice surrounding the Antarctic continent. As vagrants they travel as far north as New Zealand and the southern coasts of Africa, Australia and South America. Crabeater Seals have been known to occasionally wander far inland and die in the dry valleys adjacent to McMurdo Sound. A live animal was found 113 km from open water at an elevation of 920 m asl, and carcasses have been found as high as 1,100 m asl (Kooyman 1981, Rice 1998).",Several brief episodes of commercial harvesting of Crabeaters ended when they were determined to be economically unsuccessful.,Terrestrial|Marine,The Crabeater Seal is not listed as endangered or threatened on any National Red List. Crabeater Seals are protected by the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals and any future commercial harvest would have to be regulated through these international agreements (Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993).,Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
50194357,19832,Saiga tatarica,Critically Endangered,A2acd,2018,2018-02-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although the Saiga currently does not meet the Red List Criteria thresholds for Critically Endangered, the previous assessment of CR A2acd is retained in this assessment because this reassessment falls under the IUCN’s five year rule. This rule applies to taxa that appear to be genuinely improving in status, and states that “a taxon may be moved from a category of higher threat to a category of lower threat if and when none of the criteria of the higher category has been met for five years or more”. The Saiga is considered to have crossed the thresholds between CR and EN around 2015, therefore its status will be re-evaluated again in 2020. Saiga currently meets the thresholds for Endangered under criterion A4 based on observed, estimated and projected declines of &gt;50% over 11 years (three generations), commencing from May 2015, due to the risk of mass mortality events (MME) resulting from outbreaks of disease, exacerbated by climatic and environmental factors, and taking place alongside ongoing poaching pressure for the illegal trade in horns. Saiga populations are inherently vulnerable to mass mortality from a range of diseases. Since 2010, four disease outbreaks have caused large-scale mortality in Saiga. The most severe resulted in the death of over 200,000 Saiga in the course of three weeks in May 2015. The cause of this outbreak (and suspected in the earlier two) has been shown to be haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium <em>Pasteurella multocida</em>, which is endemic in Saiga. Lethal levels of infection are believed to have been triggered by environmental conditions including abnormally high humidity and temperature. Warm and wet climatic conditions are expected to increase in frequency due to effects of recorded and predicted climate change. The most recent MME occurred in the Mongolian population in early 2017, caused by PPR, and killed an estimated 54% of the population. Saiga are also subject to strong commercial hunting pressure and the survival of viable populations is entirely dependent on stringent implementation of conservation measures.","The Saiga is a nomadic herding species that inhabits open dry steppe grasslands and semi-arid deserts of Central Asia. Typical habitat consists of flat open areas covered with low-growing vegetation, allowing animals to run quickly; areas of broken terrain or dense cover are generally avoided, but animals may stray into these out of necessity or shelter in them during strong winds, they range from near or below sea level in the Caspian basin to ca. 1600 m in Mongolia (Heptner <em>et al. </em>1961, Bekenov <em>et al. </em>1998).<br/><br/>Saiga are migratory, with most populations having widely separated summer (northern) and winter (southern) ranges. The species lives in large herds, usually up to thousands of individuals. It has a high rate of reproduction and recruitment since females usually breed at 7-8 months and males in their second year (Heptner <em>et al. </em>1961) and females often bear twins. In years with a favourable climate the population can increase by up to 60% in a single year (Chan <em>et al.</em> 1995). Very few animals in a population are more than 3.5 years old, indicating that the population is almost completely renewed after four years (Bekenov <em>et al.</em> 1998). Males defend a harem of 5-10 females and gestation lasts about 5 months (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961). Saiga are grazers and have been recorded feeding on a wide range of grasses and herbaceous plant species.<br/><br/>For full details of the biology of the species see Heptener <em>et al.</em> (1961) and Sokolov and Zhirnov (1998).","Uncontrolled illegal hunting for horns and meat since the break-up of the former USSR has led to the catastrophic fall in Saiga numbers. Selective hunting of young males and subsequent distortion of the sex ratio has also affected reproduction by heavily skewing the sex ratio (Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2003). A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. <br/><br/>Extreme climatic events, pose a threat, drought in summer and severe winters, especially heavy snow or ‘<em>dzuud</em>’ or ‘<em>dzut</em>’ conditions when an ice-crust forms on top of snow and impedes access to forage. Several resulting instances of mass-mortality are known, such as the winter of 1953/54 in Kazakhstan when 80,000 animals died (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961).<br/><br/>Saiga are susceptible to several diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and others, which may also cause large numbers of deaths. There have been four recent mass-mortality events (MME). In 2010, around two-thirds of a calving aggregation of 20,000 in the Ural population died of a peracute respiratory disease with bloat, and this was followed in 2011 by a smaller die-off of several hundreds of Saiga with similar clinical signs, immediately after calving, and grazing in the exact same location as the earlier MME, suggesting a site-specific cause. Pasteurellosis was implicated based on clinical signs and bacteriology, but very little pathology was undertaken (Kock <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/>In 2015, more than 200,000 Saiga died within three weeks in central Kazakhstan. The proximate cause of death, based on multiple strands of evidence, was confirmed as haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium <em>Pasteurella multocida</em> type B (Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018). Statistical modelling suggests that there was unusually high relative humidity and temperature in the days leading up to the outbreak; temperature and humidity anomalies were also observed in two previous similar events in the same region. The modelled influence of environmental covariates is consistent with known drivers of haemorrhagic septicemia. Given the Saiga population’s vulnerability to mass mortality and the likely exacerbation of climate-related and environmental stressors in the future, management of risks to population viability, such as poaching and viral livestock disease, is urgently needed, as well as robust ongoing veterinary surveillance (Kock<em> et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>On 22nd December 2016 the first death of a Mongolian Saiga (<em>S. t. mongolica</em>) was reported by herders to the local authorities in Darvi Soum in the Khuisiin Gobi. Hundreds of live and dead Saiga were subsequently observed with a PPR-like syndrome and signs. Samples were confirmed at the Mongolia State Central Veterinary Laboratory (SCVL) on 6th January 2017 to contain PPR virus and gene sequencing confirmed the virus to be of high similarity to the virus recorded in sheep and goats. The Saiga infection developed rapidly into a full-blown epidemic and by the end of January; death and infection were reported across most of the Saiga range (Kock 2017). Based on carcass counts, over 54% of the population is estimated to have died.","Historically, herds numbered in the millions. Excessive hunting reduced them to an estimated total of <em>ca</em> 1,000 by the early 20th century (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961) though the accuracy of this estimate is unclear. The species received legal protection in 1919 and soon began to recover. By 1960 Saiga numbers had reached 540,000 in Russia and 1,300,000 in Kazakhstan (Linnard 1963). Commercial harvests resumed in the 1950s and continued until 1990. There were still an estimated 1,250,000 Saiga in the mid-1970s.<br/><br/>In European Russia, the Saiga population steeply declined along with land reclamation of the Volga basin, but the species remained numerous. In the 1970s the population recovered to <em>ca</em> 700,000-800,000 as a result of hunting regulation. In 1980 there were an estimated 380,000 individuals, in 1996 there were 196,000, and by the year 2000 just 26,000 (see Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2001 for annual survey results for 1980–2000).<br/><br/>Saiga numbers fell catastrophically from 1989 on, when political and economic changes that accompanied the break-up of the USSR led to weakening of nature protection systems and severe economic hardship, while at the same time, international borders were opened up, enhancing the opportunities for trading Saiga horn (Mallon 2016b and references therein). Poaching for horns surged and large numbers were killed locally for meat. The largest population of Saiga fell to 4% of its 1990 size and other populations also suffered large reductions (Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2001). Evidence from Russia indicated that selective harvesting had left a skewed population containing few adult males, many females without young, and the population close to reproductive collapse (Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2003). The full scale of the catastrophic decline was detailed by Arylov <em>et al.</em> (2004). Numbers in Kazakhstan fell to only 21,000 in 2003. The species was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2002. <br/><br/>A wide range of conservation measures was implemented and Saiga numbers stabilized then increased (Milner-Gulland 2010). The largest population, in Betpak-dala, Kazakhstan, grew by 76% annually during 2003 and 2010, demonstrating the resilience of the species. However, poaching and other factors reduced Saiga numbers in Russia and caused a 47% decrease in Ustyurt during 2009-2010. In May 2010 a disease outbreak killed <em>ca</em> 12,000 Saiga in the Ural population, a 31% loss. Nevertheless, numbers continued to grow overall and by spring 2015 there were &gt;300,000 Saiga in Kazakhstan, plus a few thousand each in in Russia and Mongolia. Then in September 2015 a mass die-off occurred in Betpak-dala, the largest population, with at least 200,000 dying in the course of three weeks (Milner-Gulland 2015, Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018). Numbers in Kazakhstan have rebounded, and results of the annual aerial census conducted 11-30 April 2017 showed a total of 152,600 Saiga (98,200 in Ural, 51,700 in Betpak-dala, 2,700 in Ustyurt), representing a 40.9% increase since 2016 (Grachev 2017). The small population in eastern Kazakhstan is not covered by the annual surveys and is estimated to number <em>ca</em> 2,000 (S. Zuther pers. comm. 2017).&#160; <br/><br/>Dash <em>et al.</em> (1977) reported only 200 Mongolian Saiga. That population increased, reaching <em>ca</em> 3,000 in 1998 and 5,200 in 2000 helped by favourable climatic conditions and active conservation measures. Numbers fell again between 2000 and 2002 as a result of severe winters and summer drought. The decline continued in 2002–2003, mainly because of poaching. Estimated numbers were <em>ca</em> 1,020 in 2003, and 750 in January 2004. However, Young <em>et al.</em> (2010) estimated 4,938 Mongolian Saiga in 2006 and 7,221 in 2007. The population had risen to <em>ca</em> 11,000 in 2016, when an outbreak of peste de petits ruminants (PPR) struck, killing <em>ca</em> 54% of the population: <em>ca</em> 5,000 are now believed to remain. <br/><br/>The global population of Saiga in January 2018 is estimated at 164,600-165,600: 154,600 in Kazakhstan, 5,000-6,000 in Russia and <em>ca</em> 5,000 in Mongolia. The number of mature individuals is estimated at 123,450-124,200.",Decreasing,"Saiga once inhabited the steppes and semi-desert regions of south-eastern Europe and across Central Asia to Mongolia and north-west China, but the original range has been greatly reduced. Saiga became extinct in Ukraine in the 18th century and disappeared from China in the middle of the 20th century (Cui <em>et al.</em> 2017). In 1958 the range covered an estimated 2.5 million km² (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961).<br/><br/>Currently, there are five Saiga populations: one in Russia, three in Kazakhstan and one in Mongolia. In Russia, Saiga are confined to the Pre-Caspian steppes north-west of the Caspian Sea in Kalmykia and adjoining parts of Astrakhan Region. A small number of Saiga have also been seen recently in Orenburg State Reserve, presumably having dispersed from the Betpak-dala population in Kazakhstan (A.A. Lushchekina pers. comm. 2017). <br/><br/>The three Kazakhstan populations are located in Ural in the north-west (partially transboundary with Russia); Betpak-dala in central Kazakhstan (the largest population), and Ustyurt. Animals from the Ustyurt population move south in winter into Uzbekistan, in some years reaching Turkmenistan. These transboundary movements have declined in range and frequency and no Saiga have been seen in Turkmenistan for several years. The number reaching Uzbekistan has also declined, further limited by construction of a border fence. There is a small outlying population east of Betpak-dala in the Semipalatinsk region.<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies also formerly occurred in the Dzungarian Gobi of far south-western Mongolia, presumably as a transboundary population with China, but has not been seen there in 40 years. The distinctive Mongolian subspecies occurs in western Mongolia, north of the Altai mountains, which isolate its range from the nominate subpopulations. Mongolian Saiga once occurred through the Great Lakes Basin from the north-west corner, east to approximately 101°E (Bannikov 1954), but both range and numbers have been severely reduced. Its current distribution range is centred on the Shargiin Gobi and Huisiin Gobi, with a small subpopulation in the Mankhan area. The range has expanded onto the Dorgon steppe in recent years.","The horns of male Saiga are highly valued in Traditional Asian Medicine (Chan <em>et al</em>. 1995).&#160;A legal harvest with fixed quotas operated from the 1950s to 1990. Harvests were formerly on an industrial scale, using trucks and a team of up to 20 hunters on each; e.g. west of the Volga River, 120,000-150,000 Saiga were harvested per year during 1957-1962 (Linnard 1963).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Appendix II.&#160;The CMS Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) Concerning Conservation, Restoration and Sustainable Use of the Saiga Antelope came into effect in 2006 and has been signed by all five range states and ten Cooperating Organizations (local and international NGOs). The MoU has an associated Medium-Term International Work Programme (MTIWP) setting out a framework for conservation action by all partners. The MTIWP is reviewed and updated periodically at technical workshops preceding CMS MoU range state meetings. <br/><br/>Saiga are protected in all range states but the level of enforcement varies. Anti-poaching efforts in Kazakhstan and other countries have been intensified over the last 10 years. <br/><br/>Some protected areas exist within Saiga range but the distance between summer and winter ranges of some populations hinders full protected area coverage. In Russia, most Saiga are found in Chernye Zemli Biosphere Reserve (1,219 km²), established in 1990, and the adjoining Stepnoi Sanctuary (1,090 km²). In Kazakhstan the Irgiz-Turgai Sanctuary (7,635 km²) and Altyn Dala State Nature Reserve (4,897 km²) were established to protect Saiga populations. In Uzbekistan the Saigachy Sanctuary was redesignated in 2015 to provide better coverage of Saiga range and now covers <em>ca</em>. 7,000 km². The Mongolian Saiga has been legally protected since 1953. Two protected areas, Sharga NR (2,869 km²) and Mankhan NR (300 km²), were gazetted in 1993 to protect most of the remaining areas of distribution.<br/><br/>Small groups of Saiga have been kept in zoos in Europe and the USA but the species is difficult to maintain in captivity. Small rescue and captive breeding centres exist in Russia and Kazakhstan. About 600 Saiga are kept in extensive semi-captive conditions at the Askania Nova centre in Ukraine. A workshop to review options for Saiga captive breeding and reintroduction took place in Moscow in August 2017.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50381127,41714,Tursiops aduncus,Near Threatened,A4cd,2019,2019-07-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins generally occur in shallow coastal waters of the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia and Australia. They are among the more commonly studied cetaceans in the Indian Ocean, especially in Shark Bay, Western Australia. However, information on distribution, population size, and trends in abundance and mortality from much of the species’ range is still very limited. As they are primarily coastal, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins often co-occur with fisheries, and bycatch is a major cause of concern for this species. Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are also at risk from high levels of noise and chemical pollution, industrial activity such as oil and gas development, and habitat reduction caused by land reclamation and coastal development (Curry and Smith 1997, Wells and Scott 1999, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003, Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2008). Furthermore, survey data suggest that Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in relatively small populations or communities with limited geographic ranges, especially where they reside close to islands (Krützen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Natoli <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Fury <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Särnblad <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2018), which can exacerbate the impact of human activities and demographic stochasticity on this species. </p>  <p>Estimates of abundance from populations for which information on bycatch is also available indicate that human-caused mortality is frequently unsustainable (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em><em> </em>1992, Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2012, Preen 2004). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Based on the sum of existing abundance estimates, the total population size for the species over its entire range is likely well in excess of 40,000 individuals. Large parts of the range have never been surveyed (e.g. much of the Arabian Sea, Arabian/Persian Gulf, Pakistan, India, Red Sea, Somalia, Yemen, Mozambique, Indonesia, Philippines).</p>  <p>The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin was classified as Data Deficient in 2008. The species distribution overlaps the range of several other coastal cetacean species that are red-listed as Endangered (Irrawaddy Dolphin <em>Orcaella brevirostris</em> and Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa plumbea</em>) or Vulnerable (Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa chinensis</em> and Australian Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa sahulensis, </em>Australian Snubfin Dolphin<em> Orcaella heinsohni</em> and the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise <em>Neophocaena phocaenoides</em>) and are subject to the same anthropogenic threats. However, compared to these other species, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is assumed to be under less immediate threat because it has a wider geographic range and probably larger numbers, greater behavioural plasticity and broader habitat preferences. Data are insufficient to present a robust case for listing the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin in a threatened category (CR, EN, or VU). However, its coastal distribution, inferred local declines, and intensity of threats throughout its range lead to the conclusion that Least Concern is not an appropriate category.</p>  <p>The Red List Guidelines (version 11, 2014) state that “the category Near Threatened is applied to taxa that do not qualify as threatened now, but may be close to qualifying as threatened, and to taxa that do not currently meet the criteria for a threatened category, but are likely to do so if ongoing conservation actions abate or cease.” Also, to qualify for Near Threatened, the taxon “should be close to qualifying for the Vulnerable category; estimates of population size or habitat should be close to the Vulnerable thresholds, especially when there is a high degree of uncertainty, or possibly meet some of the subcriteria; and this may be combined with biological susceptibility and threat.” Considering the above, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is listed as Near Threatened because: 1) it occurs in a relatively small and restricted near-shore range<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, 2) it is highly vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and its range overlaps with intensive fisheries known to entangle and kill dolphins, 3) its near-shore habitat is subject to increasing anthropogenic threats resulting in habitat loss and degradation, and 4) it is experiencing mortality rates that are likely to be causing population declines in several areas. The species therefore comes close to meeting criterion A4 for Vulnerable. Population size is inferred and suspected to have declined by close to 30% throughout the range of the species, over three generations and in a time period encompassing the past, present and future. The causes of the reduction (gillnet entanglement and coastal habitat degradation) have not ceased. Generation length for Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, according to Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007), is 21.1 years, therefore three generations is 63.3 years. Thus, an annual decline of around 0.5% would result in exceeding the 30% decline in 3 generations. Gillnet fisheries and coastal development are increasing throughout the range of the species and bycatch is anticipated to remain stable or to increase in the future without urgent and intensive efforts which are unlikely to be forthcoming.</span></p>  <p>It is important to emphasize that numerous isolated populations of this species would likely qualify as threatened subpopulations, particularly those found around island groups in the Indian Ocean.</p>","<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins generally occur over shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf or around oceanic islands. In some locations, they occur relatively far from shore, but in the shallow waters of reef banks (Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2012). In comparison to other areas, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins off the coast of Bangladesh occur in relatively deep offshore waters at the head of the Swatch-of-No-Ground submarine canyon where they were detected at an average depth of 202m (SD=112, range=45-395) (Smith and Mansur 2013). In the Clarence River estuary and Richmond River estuary in northern New South Wales, Australia, dolphin distribution varied according to season and tidal state (Fury <em>et al.</em> 2008). Along the coast of Adelaide, South Australia, dolphins occur in shallow nearshore areas and temperate reefs in summer, shallow nearshore areas in autumn and deep waters further offshore in winter (Zanardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Coffin Bay, Thorny Passage Marine Park, South Australia, dolphins showed no distinct seasonal shifts in distribution patterns and areas of high probability of dolphin occurrence were located mainly within the inner area of Coffin Bay, associated with shallow waters (2–4 m and 7–10 m) and located within 1km of land (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2018a). Strong site fidelity and restricted ranging patterns are characteristic of some populations (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2018b).</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins sometimes occur in mixed groups with Common Bottlenose Dolphins, Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa plumbea</em>), spinner dolphins (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>), Australian humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) and possibly other delphinids (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015; Koper and Plön&#160;2016). They feed on a wide variety of schooling, demersal and reef fishes, as well as cephalopods (Ross 1984; Amir <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2005; Yamazaki <em>et al.</em> 2008). In some locations, large predatory reef fishes can represent an important proportion of their diet (Belonidae and Carangidae), such as around the island of Mayotte, in the SW Indian Ocean (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2014). Group size is generally less than 30 (see Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, for a review), but in South Africa mean group size in Algoa Bay is 76, and groups of up to 600 individuals are commonly observed (Bouveroux <em>et al.</em> 2018, Melly <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>Bycatch is the dominant threat affecting Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins throughout their range. However, there are very few estimates of mortality rates or abundance over time to evaluate the severity of the impact. In Australia, the major threats include bycatch in trawls and gillnets as well as in shark nets set at popular coastal beaches to protect bathers (Hale 1997, Paterson, 1990). A total of 15 Bottlenose Dolphins (species unknown) were confirmed to have died from net entanglement in southern blue-fin tuna feedlots between 1994 and 2000 (Kemper and Gibbs 2001). Research by Mintzer <em>et al.</em> (2018) into the global use of cetaceans as bait in fisheries reported that this practice is much more widespread within Taiwanese fisheries than is presently recorded. From 1974 to 1986, the Taiwanese shark and tuna gillnet fishery exploited the waters off northern Australia, including the Arafua and Timor Seas and was responsible for the incidental catch of a variety of small cetaceans, with <em>Tursiops </em>spp<em>. </em>likely<em> aduncus</em> comprising 60% of the total cetacean catch (Harwood &amp; Hembree 1987). The annual mortality of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins may have exceeded 2,000 animals—severely impacting local population[s] (Young and Iudicello, 2007). As a result of this bycatch, the fishery was closed in 1986 (Young and Iudicello, <a style=""mso-comment-reference:GB_3;mso-comment-date:20190614T1311;mso-comment-parent: 1""></a><a style=""mso-comment-reference:GB_2;mso-comment-date:20190614T1310; mso-comment-parent:1""></a><a style=""mso-comment-reference:LU_1;mso-comment-date: 20190603T0957"">2007</a>). </p>  <p>Off western Kyushu, Japan, mortality of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in bottom-set gillnets was estimated at 12-14 individuals per year, which was considered unsustainable for the local population thought to number only somewhat more than 200 individuals (Shirakihara &amp; Shirakihara 2012). Photo-identification data collected off the coast of Bangladesh indicated that 28.2% of identified individuals had injuries related to entanglement gear (Mansur <em>et al.</em> 2012), and similar methods used in the coastal waters of Mayotte (Comoros archipelago, Mozambique Channel) showed that 19% of identified individuals bore signs of non-lethal interactions with coastal artisanal fisheries (Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2008). In Bangladesh, between August 2016 and April 2018, 31 small-scale gillnet fishing vessels participating in a Citizen Science Fishermen Safety Network reported fatal entanglements of 14 dolphins and porpoises, of which seven were Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, during 177 fishing trips (Wildlife Conservation Society 2018). Off the island of Zanzibar (Tanzania), 43 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin captures in artisanal drift gillnets were reported from 1995 to 1999. The magnitude and population-level impact of gillnet bycatch in Zanzibar was assessed in 2003-2004, and it was found that annual bycatch rates were unsustainable as they represented 9.3% of the estimated local population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Amir 2010). Bycatch was also evaluated recently in drift gillnets off Zanzibar using landing data (Temple <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2019), and there are reports of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin mortality in coastal artisanal fisheries off mainland Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique (Kiszka 2015, Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2009). Bycaught dolphins are often used as bait in longline fisheries targeting sharks (Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2018, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, an average of 34 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins per year were accidentally killed by bather protection nets around beaches between 1981 and 1989 (Cockroft 1990). This increased to an average of 45/year from 1990-1999, and from 2000-2009 the estimate was 27/year (Cliff &amp; Dudley 2011). In general, catches have steadily declined since the 1980’s due to better management of nets and the replacement of some shark nets (gillnets) with drumlines (baited hooks) in recent years (Plön, unpublished). However, the majority of bycaught animals are immature individuals and mature females, raising concern about population-level impacts (Plön, unpublished). In most areas limited data on bycatch or a lack of information on population size mean that it is not possible to determine whether annual catch rates are sustainable or not. However, the strong overlap in gillnet fishing effort and the coastal distribution of this species, combined with fairly small population sizes in many areas that have been surveyed, suggest that fishery bycatch is sufficiently high to cause population declines in many places.</p>  <p>The species’ near-shore distribution makes it vulnerable to environmental degradation, direct exploitation, and fishery conflicts (Curry and Smith 1997, Wells and Scott 1999; Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). Until hunting was outlawed in 1990, <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> was the target of a large-scale drive fishery in Taiwan’s Penghu Islands. Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in southern Japan and due to confusion with the commonly hunted Common Bottlenose Dolphin it is not clear whether they were ever specifically targeted by Japanese coastal cetacean fisheries in the past (Kasuya 2017). Some Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are taken in the small cetacean fisheries in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997) and Indonesia (Mustika 2006). Socio-ecological interview surveys in southwest Madagascar in 1999 indicated extensive hunting of coastal dolphins by Anakao fishermen of the Vezo community (Andrianarivelo, 2001). Dolphin species most often taken were the Spinner Dolphin, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin and Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin. Vezo fishers hunted coastal dolphins for local consumption and sale of meat (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Andrianarivelo (2001) estimated that over 6,000 individual dolphins, predominantly <em>Stenella</em> spp. and <em>Tursiops</em> spp. were taken in drive hunts between 1985 and 1999 from a single village, Anakao, and there was a substantial increase in catches evident during 1995–1999 accounting for 57% of all catches (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2009). The trend suggested an increase in intensity of hunting and impact on populations, likely associated with a change in hunting technique (from harpoons to nets) in the mid to late 1980s, and depletion of other food resources (e.g. decrease in fish populations), and subsequent increased adoption of cetacean hunting and consumption throughout the 1990s (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Subsequent interview surveys conducted between 2010-2013 demonstrated continuing high levels of both hunting and by-catch reported for <em>Tursiops</em> spp. along the entire west coast of Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were one of the most common species targeted by a drive-hunt in Zanzibar that stopped in 1996 (Berggren <em>et al.</em> 2007, Stensland and Berggren 2007). Anecdotal evidence suggests that several species of delphinids are hunted in the Seychelles (despite national prohibition), including Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Kiszka 2015). Although illegal, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were recorded as hunted in a harpoon fishery in southern Myanmar with six carcasses documented as being sold in March 2006 at the Maungmagan market (Tint Tun 2006). This species is one of the more common small cetaceans that are used as bait to catch sharks. There is no current evidence of traditional use/trade for consumption or medicinal use across the species range in Australia although it may have happened in the past. </p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the cetacean species most commonly kept in captivity in Asia (Wang <em>et al.</em> 1999, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). Since the early 1960s, live-captures of <em>T. aduncus</em> for oceanarium display have occurred in many areas, including South Africa, Australia, Taiwan, Japan and Java (Best and Ross 1984, Tas’an and Leatherwood 1984, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1994, Cawthorn and Gaskin 1984, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984). In 1974, 58 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were captured from Amami Oshima, Japan, for the Okinawa Expo and the aquarium which held them became the Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 1984). In 2003, a live-capture export trade was initiated in the Solomon Islands and a minimum of 108 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were exported between 2003 and 2011 to Mexico, UAE, China, the Philippines and Singapore (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2013; Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2010). This level of removals from the local population(s) is probably unsustainable (Reeves &amp; Brownell 2009). In the mid 2000’s in Australia, 32 Bottlenose Dolphins, including both <em>T. aduncus </em>and <em>T</em>. <em>truncatus</em>, were held at Sea World, Surfers Paradise, Queensland, and four <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> were kept at Pet Porpoise Pool, Coffs Harbour, New South Wales (International Species Information System 2009). In China in 2014, 39 captive facilities housed 491 cetaceans, most of them<em> Tursiops</em> spp. most from Japan and not <em>T. aduncus</em> (Chinese Cetacean Alliance 2015). Twenty-three Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are held at Ocean Park in Hong Kong, and one in Sea World, Durban (<a href=""http://www.species360.org/"">www.Species360.org</a>, reported March-2019). </p>  <p>In South Africa, of the six dolphin species (n = 90) incidentally captured in shark net installations or stranded off the east and south coasts between 2005 and 2009, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins had the second highest levels of persistent organochlorines and approximately half of adult <em>T. aduncus</em> had PCB concentrations above the previously determined threshold (17,000 ng g<sup>−1</sup> lw) for impairment of immune functions in aquatic mammals (Kannan <em>et al.</em> 2000; Gui <em>et al.</em> 2016); however it is important to note that other small cetaceans often report levels much higher than this. Despite this, systematic health assessments conducted on animals incidentally caught in shark nets between 2010 and 2012 indicated that Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were generally in good health (Lane <em>et al.</em>, 2014). In Zanzibar, levels of organochlorine pesticides in Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were lower than those reported from other regions, but methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ether levels were higher (Mwevura <em>et al.</em> 2010). Along the coast of La Réunion, DDTs, PCBs, and methoxylated-PBDEs were commonly found in blubber tissues of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Dirtu <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2016). However, concentrations were low compared to other locations, including Zanzibar (Mwevura <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p>Several diseases appear to be increasing in occurrence in coastal small cetaceans, raising concern for the health of these animals. Since the early 2000s, there have been several dolphin mortality events in Australia that have included <em>T. aduncus</em> (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2016). In these events all the dolphins tested positive for the cetacean morbillivirus. &#160;There are reports of a lobomycosis-like disease and other poor skin conditions in Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins from Mayotte and Japan which is a concern for these locally restricted populations (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009, Van Bressem <em>et al.</em> 2013, Tajima <em>et al.</em> 2015). The etiology of the disease was not established, but it may be related to the degradation of their coastal habitat (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009). The bacterial pathogen of the genus <em>Brucella</em>&#160;has also been reported from Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. Forty of 58 serum samples from <em>T. aduncus</em> from the Solomon Islands tested positive for antibodies to <em>Brucella</em> (Tachibana <em>et al.</em> 2006). This pathogen in dolphins can be a severe disease and cause abortions, male infertility, neurobrucellosis, cardiopathies, bone and skin lesions and death (Moreno&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;</p>  <p>Climate change, especially increases in sea surface temperature that are prevalent throughout coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, are negatively affecting coastal habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass beds used by Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. For example, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, an unprecedented marine heatwave in 2011 caused catastrophic losses of seagrass meadows along with mass mortality in invertebrate and fish communities. Long-term demographic data on Shark Bay’s resident Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin population revealed a significant decline in female reproductive rates following the heatwave (Wild <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the species most commonly targeted by dolphin-watching operators in the Indo-Pacific region and in some places where regulation is poor, the animals are harassed. Although dolphin-watching tourism is certainly not a threat to the species as a whole, changes in dolphin behavior have been observed in areas with intense dolphin-watching activity off Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, Japan (Matsuda <em>et al.</em> 2011) and in Menai Bay, Zanzibar (Christiansen <em>et al.</em> 2010) and around Mauritius (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2014). In Shark Bay, Western Australia, an increase in dolphin tourism coincided with a 14.9% decline in local dolphin abundance (95% CI=−20.8 to −8.23) (Bejder <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>The disturbance caused by marine construction and demolition, port development, reclamation, dredging, and other forms of habitat destruction and degradation, together with associated anthropogenic noise, is hard to quantify, but such activities and processes are widespread throughout the coastal range of this species. Individually and cumulatively, they may be causing population declines through increased mortality, impaired health, and/or reduced reproductive fitness as well as by habitat displacement.</p>","<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the best-studied species of small cetaceans in the Indian Ocean and in the western South Pacific (Solomon Islands). Although estimates of abundance (detailed below) are available for many local areas, the majority of their range has yet to be surveyed.&#160; Some available estimates are imprecise, lacking in sufficient details to evaluate their accuracy and context, and/or were generated sufficiently long ago (e.g. 20+ years ago) that, with increases in fishing intensity and coastal development, the present situation could be much different. In most locations studied, population sizes are small, typically in the low hundreds of individuals or fewer (&lt;100)<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. Exceptions include an estimate of between 1,700-2,200 individuals generated from data collected in 2005-2009 in Bangladesh, which represents an unknown portion of a larger super-population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins that extends farther west into un-surveyed waters in India; 2,000-3,000 dolphins documented to occur in Shark Bay, Western Australia; and a large population in the Algoa Bay region, South Africa estimated at about 28,000 individuals from data collected in the late 1990s (see details below).</p>  <p>In Australian waters, estimates of local populations indicate that this species is common mainly in inshore and nearshore waters. However, further genetic work is required to better define the distribution of the species, especially with regard to the taxonomic identity of particular populations to either <em>T. aduncus</em> or <em>T. truncatus</em>. Abundance estimates from surveys carried out between 2003 and 2006 for the Clarence River and Richmond River estuaries in northern New South Wales, were 71 (62–81 95% CI) and 34 (19– 49 95% CI), respectively (Fury <em>et al.</em> 2008). &#160;Abundance estimates in Jervis Bay ranged from 61 ±3.2 in summer 1998/99 to 108 ±7.1 in summer 1997/98, and from 143 ±8.1 in summer 1999/00 to 160 ±8.1 in summer 1998/99 in Port Stephens (Möller <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Moreton Bay, Queensland, a population size of 554-622 (95% CI: 510–598) was estimated from boat-based surveys in 2008-2010 (Ansmann <em>et al.</em> 2013), with a further 700 to 1,000 individuals believed to occur off Point Lookout in 1998-99 (Chilvers and Corkeron&#160;2003). In southern Australia, where Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are those identified as “<em>T. australis</em>” (Charlton-Robb, 2011), resident populations of 80–100 animals occur in Port Phillip Bay and 50-150 in the Gippsland Lakes (unpublished data cited in Charlton-Robb <em>et al.</em> 2015). Local population estimates for South Australia indicated that approximately 74 resident Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins inhabited the Port River estuary and Barker Inlet, Gulf St Vincent (Steiner and Bossley 2008). From 1989 to 2005, between 95 (SE ±45.20) and 239 (SE ±54.91) individuals occurred in Adelaide’s coastal waters in winter 2013 and summer 2014, respectively (Zanardo <em>et al.</em> 2016), and 306 (95% CI: 291–323) occurred in Coffin Bay between September 2013 and October 2015 (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Abundance estimates of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins, (likely to be the putative species ""<em>T. australis</em>"" based on their coastal distribution and small group size), was estimated&#160;using double-observer platform aerial surveys over an area of 42,438 km<sup>2</sup> within two gulfs of South Australia.&#160; A total of 3,493 (CV = 0.21; 95% CI = 2,327-5,244) individuals were estimated in summer/autumn, and 3,213 (CV = 0.20; 95% CI = 2,151-4,801) in winter/spring of 2011 (Bilgmann <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;&#160;A population of 63 (95% CI = 59 to 73) to 185 (95% CI = 171–200) Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins was estimated off Bunbury, Western Australia, during winter 2007 and in summer 2010, respectively (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sprogis <em>et al.</em>, 2016). In coastal and estuarine waters near Perth, Western Australia, total estimated abundances in the Swan Canning Riverpark estuary, Gage Roads, and Cockburn Sound/Owen Anchorage between June 2011 and May 2015 were 16, 172, and 103, respectively (Chabanne <em>et al.</em> 2017). Aerial surveys in 1989 and 1994 indicated that a population of 2,000-3,000 dolphins occurred in Shark Bay, Western Australia, most being Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Preen <em>et al.</em> 1997). In North Western Australia, 157 (95% CI: 137–186) individuals were estimated to inhabit Beagle Bay and 35 (27–48) to 60 (42–87) Cygnet Bay in 2012–2013 (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Darwin Harbor and two neighboring sites, Northern Territory, abundance estimates ranged from 20 (95% CI 17 to 23) in October/November 2013 to 38 (95% CI 28 to 47) in October 2012 (Brooks <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Between 1994 and 2001, a total of 169 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were identified off Mikura Island, Japan (Kogi <em>et al.</em> 2004), and 216 individuals (CV=2.1%) were estimated off Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, western Kyushu, Japan, in 2008 (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2012). Approximately 1,000 km south of Tokyo an estimated 200-300 animals occur around the main Ogasawara Islands (Mori 2005). In the Swatch-of-No-Ground (SoNG) submarine canyon, off the coast of Bangladesh, mark-resight abundance estimates generated for 2005-2009 were 1,701 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1,533–1,888), 1,927 (95% CI = 1,851–2,006), 2,150 (95% CI = 1,906–2,425), and 2,239 (95% CI = 1,985–2,524) individuals (Mansur <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, abundance comparisons from two aerial surveys conducted in 1986 and 1999 in the southern-western area suggested an overall decline of 71% of small cetaceans over 13 years, where <em>T. aduncus</em> is estimated to account for 71% of the overall assemblage of dolphin species (Preen 2004). Surveys of Abu Dhabi waters conducted in 2014-2015 (55 boat-based surveys, 5,592 km of on effort transects) yielded an estimate of 1,834 (95% CI = 1,176-3,124) individuals (Díaz López and Methion 2016). Surveys of Dubai waters conducted in 2014 (56 boat-based surveys and 220 hours of effort) resulted in 8 sightings and 92 individuals being identified (A. Natoli, unpublished data).</p>  <p>In East Africa and around some islands of the western Indian Ocean, several abundance estimates are available. Between 1999 and 2002 off southwest Zanzibar, Tanzania the smallest estimate of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin abundance was 136 in 2001 (95%CI = 124-172) and the largest was 179 animals (95% CI = 167-212) in 2002 (Stensland <em>et al.</em> 2006). In southern Kenya, a population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins was estimated using mark-recapture as ranging from 19 individuals (95% CI: 11–33) to a maximum of 104 dolphins (95% CI: 78–139) (Pérez-Jorge <em>et al.</em> 2016) based on photo-identification data collected between 2006 and 2009. Off the southwest coast of Mauritius, a resident population of <em>T. aduncus </em>was estimated to number &lt;100 individuals based on surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010 (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2014). Off the coast of Pemba in Tanzania, another small resident population was estimated to number 83 (CV 7.8%, 95% CI 72-97) individuals (Kasuga <em>et al.</em> in review) and off the island of Mayotte abundance was estimated from closed population models at 82 ±19 SE individuals from data collected between 2004 and 2009 (Pusineri <em>et al.</em> 2014). Along the coast of La Réunion, an abundance of 72 (SE=6.17, 95%CI = 61-85) was estimated based on photo-identification data collected along the west coast from 2009 to 2014 (Dulau <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2017).</p>  <p>In South Africa, there appear to be both coastal (with mostly small group sizes) and migratory (with large group sizes) populations of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, but the boundaries between these are not well defined (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the number of individuals in the area between the Tugela River and Durban was estimated at 520 (160–970, 95% CI) in 1989 (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em><em> </em>1992). A maximum of 350 individuals was estimated in the area between Durban and Ramsgate (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em> 1991). Overall, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in the KZN area are likely fragmented into several populations (Natoli <em>et al.</em>, 2008). A migratory population in southeastern South Africa is estimated at more than 2,000 individuals and is characterized by large groups of hundreds of individuals (Natoli <em>et al.</em> 2008). An estimate of 28,482 (95% CI = 16,220–40,744; CV = 0.22) based on field work conducted in the mid 1990’s was calculated using POPAN mark-recapture analysis of photo-identified individuals in the Algoa Bay region of the Eastern Cape (<a name=""_Hlk3288225"">Reisinger and Karczmarski </a>2010). Due to the very low number of recaptures (131 out of 1,569 total captures), the estimation models fit the data poorly, which means that the point estimate, as well as the 95% CI, may not be accurate; however, the large number of identified individuals and small number of recaptures confirms that there was a sizeable population of this species in the wider Algoa Bay region at that time. Group sizes of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in Algoa Bay are consistently large for this species, being reported as typically ranging from 200-600 individuals (Ross 1982; Melly <em>et al.</em> 2017; Bouveroux <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is important to note that with intensifying fisheries and coastal development, the relatively favorable status of these dolphins in Algoa Bay could be very different now, 20+ years after the data used to generate the estimate by Reisinger and Karczmarski (2010) were collected.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins have a discontinuous distribution in warm-temperate and tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. They are found primarily in shallow coastal and estuarine waters and in shallow reef complexes (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species occurs from Australia in the east, throughout southeast Asia (including the Malay Archipelago and Cocos [Keeling] Islands) (Tom Jefferson pers. comm.), China (north to the Korean Peninsula) and southwestern Japan) and around the northern Indian Ocean rim (including in the Red Sea and Arabian/Persian Gulf) to the western range limit in eastern South Africa (Wells and Scott 2002, Möller and Beheregaray 2001, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins also occur in the coastal waters of many oceanic islands distant from major land masses including the Maldives (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2012), the Andamans (Malakar <em>et al.</em> 2015), New Caledonia (Borsa 2006), the Comoros and Mayotte (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2012), the Solomon Islands (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2015), La Réunion (Dulau-Drouot <em>et al.</em> 2008), Mauritius (Webster <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2014) and the Seychelles (Kiszka<em> </em>2015).</p>","<p>It is harvested for food in some places, and for international trade as display animals.</p>",Marine,"Specific conservation actions for this species are lacking from most of  the range of the species although they are generally legally protected  in most range states. Due to increasing pressure of dolphin watching  tourism in Mayotte, specific measures prohibiting swimming with this  species have been implemented. In Australia dolphin watching is  regulated and there are National Whale and Dolphin Watching Guidelines  in place. In other parts of the species range where there are dolphin  watching or swim-with-dolphins tourism these are either unregulated, or  there has been some effort to manage or regulate the activities but  guidelines are not followed. This species occurs in numerous Marine  Protected Areas (MPAs) throughout their range but these are usually  designed with a focus on other marine species and not specifically to  include key habitat for Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. <br/><br/>The  exception to this is an MPA declared by the Government of Bangladesh in  2014 covering 1,700 km² which encompasses almost all Bottlenose Dolphin  sightings made during intensive cetacean surveys of coastal waters in  Bangladesh between 2004 to 2019. Efforts are still underway to establish  conservation management in this MPA. One promising approach for  reducing Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin bycatch in Bangladesh is an  initiative that requires gillnet fishermen to attend their nets, release  entangled dolphins, and collect data from mortalities in exchange for  capacity building to improve their safety at sea.<br/>Various strategies  have been tested to mitigate the unintentional catch of dolphins in  coastal bather protection nets in South Africa. Devices have been added  to the nets to make the nets more conspicuous acoustically (for example,  air-filled floats, clangers), or to deter the dolphins with sounds  (such as pingers), but these were not successful (Cliff and Dudley  2011). In the past decade, some gillnets have been replaced with baited  hooks (called drumlines) which have lower dolphin bycatch (Cliff and  Dudley 2011). <br/><br/>In Australia bycatch action plans for several  fisheries were introduced in 2001 to reduce the bycatch of dolphins and  other marine animals and these actions are managed by the Australian  Fisheries Management Authority. Mitigation measures, such as the use of  pingers to warn animals away from nets, escape panels in purse seine  nets, and handling methods for animals brought aboard vessels have been  proposed. Pingers are currently used to warn cetaceans away from shark  nets installed to protect bathers in Australia (Department of  Environment 2019).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Nevertheless, preliminary analysis on available data suggests that the species is negatively impacted by intensive irrigated agriculture that has fragmented its prime habitat and perhaps also its population in India (see Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;The absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, a future prediction on population decline can be made based on available information on the geographical range of the species, niche model analysis and current change in land use regimes.<br/><br/>Most of the distributional range of the species in India and Nepal lies outside the protected area network and in the deciduous forests of central India which are severely disturbed. The total extent of prime habitat in India and Nepal is around 25% of the total distributional range within these countries.<br/><br/>The current (2015) Government of India has made provisions for speedy approval of developmental projects in non-protected areas including areas under mining, industrialisation and urbanisation (Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Moreover, there are plans for expanding the national area under agriculture by 10% by 2017 (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014), a development which will continue in the future. Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species are rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy since the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. The impact of this development on persistence of biodiversity remains unclear.<br/><br/>Assuming 10 years as the average life span of the Rusty-spotted Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year, we estimate the average age of mature individuals (Generation Length - GL) in the current population at around 4 years, using the formula by Pacifici <em>et al.</em> (2013): GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3, Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR). In the next three Rusty-spotted Cat generations, i.e. 12 years, the prime locations where populations are likely to persist are protected areas as these are the only zones remaining close to intact. This translates to 75% of habitat in the current distributional range facing an imminent danger of being converted. As much of this is marginal habitat for the species, a 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over the next three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population and therefore has a concomitantly greater contribution to the overall ‘average’ global change.<br/><br/>Therefore, a future decline of 20-25% over the next three generations is suspected, occurring primarily due to projected habitat loss in central India, with populations stable only in protected areas and little information available about the small proportion of the population found in Sri Lanka.","Though the species is also found in proximity to human habitation (Worah 1991, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mukherjee 1998, Nekaris 2003), preliminary results of a study using niche models and known Rusty-spotted Cat locations within India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material), suggests that at a broad scale this cat’s distribution is limited by large contiguous tracts of hostile habitat, specifically intensive, irrigated agriculture (Silva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These results were a consensus of four models that incorporated land cover, bioclimatic variables and disturbance measures with 61 location points of the species. The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>There are recent records of the Rusty-spotted Cat from the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka in small, mostly isolated forest patches (&lt;5 km²) interspersed with tea estates but it is not known if the species occurs in or uses the tea plantation areas (Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). <br/><br/>A few observations suggest that the species preys on rodents (Kunal Patel and Vidya Athreya <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em>).","Habitat loss and the spread of cultivation are serious problems for wildlife in South Asia. The total extent of prime habitat of the Rusty-spotted Cat in India and Nepal is equivalent to around 25% of the range of the species in these countries. These are perhaps the only areas where populations of the species are likely to persist in the future. This translates to 75% of the current habitat in India and Nepal facing an imminent danger of conversion to urban areas, industry, mining and other forms of land use hostile to Rusty-spotted Cat (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014, Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species is rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy during the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. Categorization of certain portions of the species’s habitat (scrub, degraded forest) as wasteland facilitates such conversion (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.). <br/><br/>As much of the distributional range constitutes marginal habitat for the species, this 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population<br/><br/>Since much of the species’s range is within hugely human-dominated areas undergoing rapid land use change, fragmentation of habitat and disease should be considered as serious threats. There are concerns regarding possible hybridization of Rusty-spotted Cat with domestic cats (Kittle and Watson 2004) but these have yet to be substantiated and measured to determine if this factor is indeed a threat to the species. There is a belief that Rusty-spotted Cats do not get into conflict, unlike Jungle Cats, since they are believed not to prey on poultry (Manakadan and Sivakumar 2006). However, this needs to be backed by research and the threats need to be evaluated across the species’s global distribution. <br/><br/>Reflecting the uncertainty of this assessment, the species should be prioritised for research and monitoring.","Information on this species is not just meagre but also incidental and hence it is difficult to infer, with confidence, its population size, connectivity between populations, threats, and persistence in the future. It appears to be rare almost wherever it occurs (Kunal Patel and Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). <br/><br/>Population trend: the absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, the niche model from India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material) suggests a fragmented population.&#160;The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country (Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"The Rusty-spotted Cat was earlier believed to be restricted to India and Sri Lanka but recent photographic records show its presence in Bardia National Park, Nepal (Ramjan Choudhary and Rabin Kadariya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), bordering India. Its geographical distribution is as yet not clearly documented but recent locality records suggest it is more widespread than earlier believed (Chakraborty 1978, Phillips 1984, Wright 1984, Miththapala 2006, Athreya 2010, Mukherjee <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Raza Kazmi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Jugal Tiwari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Anonymous 2013, Dharmendra Khandal <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Pankaj Koparde and Gaurang Gowande <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,&#160;Ramjan Choudhary and&#160;Rabin Kadariya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Nevertheless it has a relatively restricted global distribution for a cat and little is known of its ecology or local abundance (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Within India the distribution of this species is similar to, though far more restricted than, the Jungle Cat <em>Felis chaus</em> (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.).",,Terrestrial,"The Indian population is included on CITES Appendix I, while the Sri Lanka and Nepal populations are included on CITES Appendix II. The species is fully protected over most of its range, with hunting and trade banned in India and Sri Lanka, although domestic trade was largely uncontrolled in Sri Lanka 20 years ago (Nowell and Jackson 1996); no more recent information has been traced. The occurrence of the species in&#160;Nepal&#160;has only very recently been documented and perhaps it does not figure specifically in conservation laws of the country.

Its current northern limits of geographic distribution are still unclear, but show a large extent of occurrence of <em>ca</em>. 3,287,075 km². However, its area of occupancy (AOO) is rather limited and within the threatened Cerrado and Atlantic Forest domains. Considering all available natural habitat in its entire range, the maximum AOO possible would be of only 473,254 km². Additionally, given the level of fragmentation and the very small size of some patches, it is very unlikely that the Southern Tiger Cat would be present in some parts of this remaining area. Besides, no single species occupies all natural areas within its geographic range. Therefore its actual AOO would be much lower than the estimates presented here. The species is almost always found at low/very low population densities (0.01–0.05/km² or lower), especially in protected areas, given the negative impact it suffers from Ocelots (‘ocelot effect’ – Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em> </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, most of the population probably occurs outside protected areas, in places under severe pressure from land development/habitat conversion. A population decline in the past few years has also been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, the estimated density dropped from 0.25/km<sup>2</sup> to 0.13/km<sup>2</sup> by almost 50% from 2005 to 2013/14, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013, Kasper<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2016, M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). If this decline continues, a population reduction of 80% would be expected in three generations (15 years) in this area. In another area the estimated density dropped by over 50% from 0.2/km<sup>2 </sup>to &lt;0.1/km<sup>2</sup> from 2008 to 2015, resulting in a population reduction of over 7%/year. If this decline continues, the population would disappear in 3 generations in this area. Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, MMA/IBAMA 2011). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012, R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comm.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between <em>L. guttulus</em> and <em>Leopardus geoffroyi</em> on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the southern tiger cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2008, 2013a). <br/><br/><br/>A declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of <em>L. guttulus</em> was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (AOO) and typical lower population densities (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira<em> <em>et al.</em> </em>2010, 2013). Given the likely overestimation of the AOO, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. Based on the observed continuing decline in mature individuals of 50% and more in two important conservation areas for <em>Leopardus guttulus</em> a continuing decline of over 10% over 15 years (= three generations) can be estimated. Due to its low estimated population size of less than 10,000 mature individuals and the high observed population reductions, the species may even qualify for Endangered in the near future.","The Southern Tiger Cat inhabits a broad variety of habitats. These range from dense tropical and subtropical rainforests, deciduous/semideciduous, and mixed pine forests, to the open savannahs, and beach vegetation, both pristine and disturbed (Tortato and Oliveira 2005; Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, 2013; Oliveira 2011). In the Pantanal (wet/swampy savannah) it is extremely rare and has been recorded only in the dry savannahs, not in the marshy areas. Although the Southern Tiger Cat can also inhabit disturbed formations, its occurrence near agricultural fields is, nevertheless, limited by the presence of natural cover. Thus, restricted to mosaics of forest or savannah and small-scale agriculture. In these areas, both telemetry information and scat analysis indicates that it uses the natural formations and does not venture deep into the agricultural areas <em>per se</em>, but only on its borders, taking advantage of the high rodent densities (Facure-Giaretta 2002, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The species is mostly found in lowland areas, reaching up to 2,000 m above sea level.<br/><br/>Litter size is usually one, sometimes two (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Diel activity pattern is predominantly nocturno-crepuscular, but with considerable amount of daytime activity. This activity during any time of the day is suggested to be a strategy to avoid predation by the larger sympatric Ocelot (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Prey base consists mostly of small mammals, birds and lizards, with average prey size at &lt;100 g, but does include larger sized prey (&gt;1 kg) (Facure-Giaretta 2002, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Tortato 2009, Trigo&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013b). The limited information on home ranges shows that it is 2.5 times larger than they would be expected, based on the cat’s body size. This may be another consequence to avoid other larger and potential felid predators. Known home ranges for the Southern Tiger Cat range from 2 to 25 km² (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010).","The Southern Tiger Cat was heavily exploited for the fur trade decades ago, following the decline in Ocelot trade. Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. A population decline in the past few years has been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, where the density estimates dropped by more than 50%, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2013; M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, <span style="""">MMA/IBAMA 2011</span>). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012; R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comms.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between <em>L. guttulus</em> and <em>Leopardus geoffroyi</em> on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the Southern Tiger Cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Trigo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013a).","<em>Leopardus guttulus</em>&#160;population densities vary, but tend to be low throughout most of its range especially in regard to what would be expected of such a small cat species. Given its body size, expected density would be 91/100 km².&#160;&#160;Population densities of <em>L. guttulus</em> vary from one to 25/100 km². It is generally around 1-5/100 km² (or even lower) in most of its area of occupancy but can get to 13-25/100 km² in a few isolated high density areas (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Higher densities are attained only where Ocelots are absent or very rare. Where Ocelots are common or attain densities of 10/100 km² or higher, the Southern Tiger Cat is extremely rare and is expected to reach numbers much lower than 1-5/100 km². Thus, the Southern Tiger Cat is negatively impacted by Ocelots by interspecific killing due to potential for competition in what is known as the “Ocelot effect” (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).<br/><br/>The state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil has been considered the most important area for <em>Leopardus guttulus</em> conservation and thus to harbour the best and likely most viable population. This is due to the extent of the state’s remaining Atlantic Forest, level of connectivity and the cat’s presence in reasonable numbers in local Conservation Units due in most part to the absence of Ocelots (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Nevertheless, previous high densities found in some areas there (25/100 km²) seemed to have dropped to 13/100 km² or 7/100 km² in the past few years, likely as a consequence of natural rodent reduction (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, M. Tortato pers. comm.). Therefore, expected higher densities of this species might be lower than previously thought. Considering all remaining area of natural habitat there and the species densities recorded, population size in Santa Catarina is expected to be around 1,500–2,800 (more likely towards the lower limit). Elsewhere, population reductions of <em>ca</em>. 67% have been observed due to an increase in number of Ocelots (Oliveira 2011, Marques 2013). At other areas, reductions from 20-24/100 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 8/100km<sup>2</sup>&#160;have also been noted (Oliveira 2011, Kasper <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2015), but not as a consequence of the Ocelot effect.<br/><br/>Likely as a consequence of the Ocelot effect, <em>L. guttulus</em> is found mostly outside protected areas of two of South America’s most threatened biomes, the highly fragmented Atlantic Forest, whose natural cover remaining is around 8% and the savannahs, whose remaining area is &lt;40%. In this way, conservation efforts should focus outside protected areas.<br/><br/>A declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of <em>L. guttulus</em> was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (AOO) and typical lower population densities (Oliveira 2011; Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, 2013). Given the likely overestimation of the AOO, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. A future decline of 10–30% over the next 15-18 years (= three generations) is projected due to declining AOO (habitat loss) and habitat quality. Even though the Southern Tiger Cat is found in several protected areas, no conservation units within the species’ range in Brazil or elsewhere are expected to house 500 individuals, most far below 200 (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",Decreasing,"The Southern Tiger Cat ranges from Central to southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina in the Provinces of Misiones and Corrientes. The species is absent from the Paraguayan Chaco. The northern limits of its geographic range are still unclear. It reaches Central Brazil in the states of Minas Gerais, Goiás, the border area of the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul state, and the Atlantic Forest area of eastern Bahia in the northeast region (T. de Oliveira pers. comm.). Whether it overlaps with <em>Leopardus tigrinus </em>and to what extent is still unclear. Known altitudinal range of the Southern Tiger Cat is below 2,000 m (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",See under Threats.,Terrestrial,"<a name=""OLE_LINK2""></a><a name=""OLE_LINK1""><em>Leopardus guttulus</em> is not formally included on CITES Appendix I as a separate species yet (but would be automatically included as<em> L. tigrinus</em>).

This species is Vulnerable in Argentina – still under <em>L. tigrinus</em> (Diaz and Ojeda 2000) and Brazil (MMA 2014). Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, probably because of the impact of the higher Ocelot densities and, as such, conservation efforts will have to focus outside protected areas (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2008, Oliveira 2011). These areas are, in turn, under intense pressure from impacts, either of fragmentation and/or area loss.

98845541,98471199,Clupea pallasii,Data Deficient,,2019,2019-02-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is a marine, pelagic-neritic schooling species that is widely distributed throughout the southern Arctic and northern Pacific oceans. Archaeologically, subpopulations were abundant throughout its range despite natural fluctuations; however, more recently (1900’s) this species has exhibited erratic, and at times, catastrophic declines, possibly caused by heavy industrial exploitation during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century combined with natural causes like food availability and climatic changes. Overall, currently available (~ 2000 – present) global population information for this species is extremely variable. Some regions within its distribution (e.g., northeast Pacific: Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) have long time series data available (e.g., spawning stock biomass estimates, landings data, etc.), while other regions (e.g., northwest Pacific: Japan, Russia, Korea, China) have little to no current information available. Within some areas where data are available, spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates suggest rapid fluctuations (e.g., Alaska, California, Canada, etc.); however, these estimates are spatially and temporally asynchronous. For example, in some localities (e.g., Prince William Sound, Alaska; Cherry Point, Washington; West Coast Vancouver Island, British Columbia) SSB estimates decreased by up to 77 % in the most recent 15 years available (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). However, in other neighboring localities (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska; Quilcene Bay, Washington), SSB estimates have increased by up to 400 % in the most recent 15 years available. Given the inconsistencies in the trends of available data within and between regions (including temporal differences in biological characteristics such as maximum age and age at first maturity), we are unable to extrapolate trends in SSB across the entire global population.</p>  <p>The prominent threat to this species is likely a changing climate which can impact food availability for each of several life history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults), spawning distribution and recruitment within local stocks. Additionally, climatic changes can also impact the distribution of major predators (e.g., birds, pinnipeds and other fishes) which can have widespread ecological and fishery effects. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that disease can significantly affect recruitment especially as a consequence of anthropogenic impacts, though more research is needed. In general, this species is also exploited to a varying degree throughout a large portion of its global range. It is regarded as the second most important targeted species in the northwest Pacific; it is one of the few important commercial species targeted in Russian Far East territory and has been taken in industrial trawl fisheries since the early 1900s. However, little current information on the status of this species in this region is available. In the eastern Pacific, this species is targeted at varying intensities in the purse seine and gill net fisheries for food, bait and sac roe exploitation. Throughout its range, it likely also contributes small quantities to bycatch in trawl, seine and longline industrial fisheries that target other important species such as Alaska pollock, cod and various flatfishes. Given the commercial importance of this species, fisheries management regulations have been implemented within its range, such as yearly fishery closures and stock-specific management plans including yearly stock assessments, catch quotas, harvest rates, and biomass reference points. In some areas, (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska) herring have responded to management measures. However, it has not proven to respond well to management and conservation measures in other localities where it has experienced major declines in abundance, even after periods of long-term fisheries closures in some cases (e.g., Cherry Point, Washington, Yellow Sea, Hokkaido-Sakhalin). This may further suggest that natural changes are possibly preventing the recovery of this species in these areas. </p>  <p>In general, the status of this species within the southernmost portions of its range (e.g., within the Yellow Sea and off coastal Japan in the western Pacific and off the continental U.S. in the eastern Pacific, including California, Oregon and Washington) is of concern. Sea surface temperatures are expected to continue to increase in these areas as a result of global climate change, potentially leading to a northward contraction of its range into cooler waters. It is known that the spawning distribution of this species changes naturally throughout its range in response to local abundance and environmental conditions; some areas observe new spawning localities or renewed spawning in previously known localities, while other areas observe a cessation or contraction in known spawning localities leading to the concern of the possible depletion of local stocks. More research is needed to determine whether changes are due to fishing pressure or a natural shift in distribution.</p>  <p>In light of the major commercial importance of this species, marked declines in some places and increases in others, and major data gaps in large regions of its range where it is known to be exploited (e.g., current/recent status in Japan and Russia), assessing the overall status of this species globally as per the IUCN Red List Criteria is not possible, and therefore <em>Clupea pallasii</em> is assessed as Data Deficient. If and when information becomes available where it currently is not, this species should be immediately be reassessed. Furthermore, due to the variations in life history characteristics, exploitation level and biomass trends, sub-global assessments for this species are urgently needed. </p>","<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is a pelagic-neritic schooling species that mainly occupies the deeper waters of coastal shelf regions to about 300 – 400 metres at maximum. Herring move inshore to breed in high-energy, shallow intertidal and subtidal habitats from about November to July (Whitehead 1985, Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Hay <em>et al. </em>2009). Spawning takes place once a year (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a) in many localities throughout its global range. Pacific herring are late winter and spring spawners (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001a) with peak spawning events occurring later in the spring at progressively higher latitudes (Haegele and Schweigert 1985). For example, in the eastern Pacific, spawning takes place from November to March in California, February to April in British Columbia, and from March to June off south and north Alaska, respectively (Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Age at maturity varies geographically from 1 – 4 years of age (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). During mass spawning events, females deposit adhesive eggs directly on the bottom, on vegetative substrata such as seagrasses and seaweeds, rocky intertidal areas or man-made structures (e.g., pier pilings, rip rap: Blaxter 1985, Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em><em>2001a, </em>2009, Shirafuji <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160; After spawning, individuals generally migrate back to foraging grounds in deeper water (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Similar to age at maturity and spawning time, there is latitudinal variability in other biological factors including, maximum size, longevity and migration patterns. For example, compared to herring within the eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska herring reach a smaller maximum size overall, have a shorter maximum longevity, more frequent recruitment events (every four years compared to every ten years in the eastern Bering Sea) and do not undergo large migrations (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In general, schools consist of individuals of similar size/age such that juveniles do not mix with larger juveniles or adults (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This species is known to a maximum standard length of 33 cm (Whitehead 1985), though there are records of this species with a total length of 46 cm (Coad and Reist 2004). Maximum longevity varies from 7 – 15 years (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Adult herring are known to exhibit extensive diel vertical migrations where they are deeper in the water column by day and shallower during the night (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Herring diets vary but they mainly consume zooplankton; larvae consume copepod eggs, nauplii and young stages of other organisms, juveniles mainly consume copepods and adults predominately feed on copepods and euphausiids (Wailes 1936, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Long-term cyclic changes in size-at-age of Alaskan herring have been correlated to zooplankton abundance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), though direct causes are not known (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). It is possible that subpopulations elsewhere (e.g., Hokkaido – Sakhalin, Yellow Sea) are impacted by food availability and climatic variation as well, though more research is needed. </p><em> </em>","<p><em>Clupea pallasii</em>&#160;is heavily fished throughout a large portion of its global range and has shown considerable population fluctuations with dramatically reduced abundance levels in parts of its range (see summaries in: Ware 1991, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat 2009, Schweigert <em>et al</em>. 2010, FAO 2016, WDFW 2018<em>a</em>). Archaeological evidence indicates that this species exhibited natural fluctuations; however, over the last century, some subpopulations have exhibited erratic, and at times, catastrophic declines (McKechnie <em>et al.</em> 2014). It is possible that drastic declines stemmed from natural causes; however, excessive industrial harvesting is suggested to be a likely reason for differences in ancient and modern herring abundance (McKechnie and Smith 2013). In more recent years, other factors such as food availability and environmental forcing, rather than heavy fishing pressure, likely play a larger role in the overall abundance throughout its range (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Ward <em>et al. </em>2017, 2019), as most fisheries appear to be regulated and respond to management. For example, in British Columbia, precautionary harvest policies have been in place since 1986 (i.e., stocks are managed using a 20% harvest rate and a commercial fishery threshold of 25% of the estimated unfished spawning biomass, 0.25B<sub>0</sub>: Cleary <em>et al. </em>2010). Since policies have been in place, most major stocks within British Columbia experienced declines in biomass until 2010 (Schweigert <em>et al</em>. 2010). Similarly, all five major British Columbian stocks experienced declines in weight-at-age from the mid-1980’s to 2010, with a levelling off and/or increase in the most recent five years available (2012 – 2017: DFO 2018). Additionally, herring in British Columbia previously displayed a long-term decline in size-at-age, suggesting a possible reduction or limitation of the food supply or other resources that may have prevented recovery (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2010); however, this declining trend has reversed in the most recent years (2010 – present: Hay <em>et al. </em>2019). </p>  <p>It is known that the spawning distribution of this species changes naturally throughout its range in response to local abundance and environmental conditions; some areas observe new spawning localities or renewed spawning in previously known localities, while other areas observe a cessation or contraction in known spawning localities leading to concerns about possible depletion of local stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2009). More research is needed to determine whether changes are due to fishing pressure or a natural shift in distribution (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2009). There is also evidence to suggest that disease significantly affects recruitment of this species (Marty <em>et al</em>. 2011); however, more research is needed to determine the overall severity of this potential threat.</p>","<p></p><p><strong><u>OVERALL POPULATION TRENDS</u></strong></p>  <p><em>Clupea pallasii</em> is a cold-water clupeid distributed throughout the Arctic and northern Pacific Oceans. Overall, available population information for this species is extremely variable. For example, some regions within its distribution (e.g., northeast Pacific: Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) have long time series data available (e.g., spawning stock biomass estimates, landings data, etc.), while other regions (e.g., northwest Pacific: Japan, Russia, Korea, China) have little to no current information available. This species, similar to other clupeids, is known to have large episodic recruitments (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the past (e.g., 1977) there has been broad temporal synchrony throughout many years with the arrival of strong cohorts in British Columbia and Alaska (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001b), though this is not consistent with current trends. Within some areas where data are available, spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates suggest rapid fluctuations (e.g., Alaska, California, Canada, etc.); however, these SSB estimates are usually asynchronous with respect to neighboring localities. For example, in some localities (e.g., Prince William Sound, Alaska; Cherry Point, Washington; West Coast Vancouver Island, British Columbia) SSB estimates decreased by greater than 85 % over the time series and up to 77 % in the most recent 15 years available (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). However, in other localities (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska; Quilcene Bay, Washington), SSB estimates have increased by 35 – 1000 % over the time series and up to 400 % in the most recent 15 years available. Given the inconsistencies in the temporal trends of available data within and between regions (including differences in biological characteristics such as maximum age and age at first maturity), we are unable to extrapolate trends in SSB across the entire global population. For consistency, all data reported in short tons (e.g., U.S. data) were converted and are expressed in metric tonnes. </p>  <p>In general, the conservation status of herring within the southernmost portion of its global range (e.g., within the Yellow Sea and off coastal Japan in the western Pacific and off the continental U.S. in the eastern Pacific, including California, Oregon and Washington) is of concern due to climate forcing. Sea surface temperatures are expected to continue to increase in these areas as a result of global climate change (Perry <em>et al. </em>2005, Hillebrand 2018, USGCRP 2018), potentially leading to a northward contraction of its range into cooler waters.</p>  <p><strong><u>NORTHWESTERN PACIFIC</u></strong></p>  <p>Within the northwestern Pacific, this species is divided into three subsections: the northwestern North Pacific, which includes five major stocks in Russian waters; the southwestern North Pacific, which includes the Sakhalin region of Russia and the Hokkaido region of Japan; and the Yellow Sea (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In the northwestern Pacific region, there appear to be three distinct forms of herring: (1) a migratory ‘marine’ herring, which is relatively long-lived and which undergoes considerable migrations; (2) a similar ‘coastal’ form which consists of a number of smaller groups and spends most of its life close to shore with little or no migrations; and (3) a unique ‘lagoon’ form (sometimes referred to as ‘lake’ herring) whose life history is connected with low-salinity lagoons or embayments (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In general, the five major Russian stocks, along with the Hokkaido-Sakhalin stock constitute the major ‘marine’ forms of the western Pacific, which comprise the largest total biomass and support large commercial fisheries in the northwest Pacific (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Coastal and ‘lagoon’ forms may be unique to the western Pacific; similar forms have not been described from the eastern Pacific (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Specific information regarding the three subsections in the northwestern Pacific is listed below.</p>  <p><strong><u>Northwestern North Pacific (Russia):</u></strong><em> </em>Five major stocks exist within this region: Korf-Karagin stock in the northwestern Bering Sea; Gizhiga-Kamchatka stock along the Kamchatka Peninsula; Okhotsk stock in the Sea of Okhotsk; Dekastri stock in the Strait of Tartary; and Peter the Great Bay stock in the Sea of Japan (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Additionally, Russian scientists recognize roughly 20 smaller groups of ‘coastal’ and ‘lagoon’ herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Commercial fisheries for Dekastri and Peter the Great Bay stocks were established first (~1920s); substantial commercial fisheries began to target other stocks in later years (Korf-Karagin in 1939, and Okhotsk and Gizhiga-Kamchatka in the mid – to late – 1940s: Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Catch records are characterized by substantial variation in annual catch overall, reflecting fluctuations in the availability of herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The three northernmost stocks (Okhotsk, Gizhiga-Kamchatka and Korf-Karagin) previously supported very large catches which increased rapidly in the late 1950s and exceeded ~500,000 tonnes in the 1960s (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This peak was followed by a rapid decline in all five ‘marine’ stocks where a decline in catch rates and assessed biomass led to a prohibition of commercial fishing (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). A period of very low abundance persisted until the late 1990s where there was evidence of a modest recovery of the Okhotsk and Korf-Karagin stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). As of the early 2000s, the southernmost Russian stocks (Dekastri and Peter the Great Bay) remained in a state of severe depression (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Information regarding the more recent status (i.e., 2001 – present) is not available for these five major stocks. </p>  <p><strong><u>Southwestern North Pacific (Hokkaido-Sakhalin):</u></strong><em> </em>One major stock is recognized within this subsection of the northwestern Pacific waters, which includes the waters off the Sakhalin region of Russia and the Hokkaido region of Japan. It is referred to as Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring (sometimes also referred to as Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring). Previously, this stock was the most abundant among all western Pacific herring stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). During the first half of the 1900s, Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring were very widely distributed and supported an industrial fishery in the northern part of the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk (along the shores of eastern Sakhalin to the Island of Iona, and along the Kuril Islands to the Island of Paramushir), and the Pacific Ocean (along the southern Kuril Islands: Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Catches have been recorded by national and provincial authorities in Japan and Russia since 1887, with a historical peak of 973,000 tonnes in 1897 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Since the peak in 1897, catches show fluctuations with an overall declining annual trend and fishing grounds moved north along the western coast of Hokkaido; spawning herring have disappeared from the Hokkaido coast altogether (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In the most recent years available (~ 1960s – 2000), the Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring has been at the lowest level of abundance for the entire history of its commercial exploitation; it has declined from an average of 67.2 billion fish in the late 1800s – 1950 to about 5.8 billion fish in the 1950s, and has further declined to an average of 1.6 billion fish between 1961 and 2000 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Small fisheries have continued since the collapse of this stock with annual catches less than 50,000 tonnes on average (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The cause of collapse is not certain; oceanographic conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature) have changed, which may limit recruitment in the region. Additionally, the major decline coincided with a period of increased effort, efficiency and industrialization of the fishery (e.g., introduction of acoustic sounders, spotter planes and trawl nets) where immature and young fish were caught in high numbers, which likely further limited recruitment. As of 2000, there were no indications of change in the extremely depressed status of the Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a); information regarding the more recent status (2001 – present) is not available for this stock.</p>  <p><strong><u>Yellow Sea:</u></strong> Herring in the Yellow Sea may be completely isolated from others within the northwestern Pacific (Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008). In the Yellow Sea region, this species undergoes rapid and extreme fluctuations in abundance. Changes in biomass may be caused by herring seasonally moving in an out of the Yellow Sea (D. Hay, pers. com. January 2019); long-term changes may be correlated with a 36-year cycle of dryness/wetness in eastern China (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). It is commercially important in the Yellow Sea and has a very long exploitation history in the surrounding countries. In the last century (1900 – 2000) the commercial fishery experienced three major peaks (1900, 1938 and 1972) followed by periods of little to no catch (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This stock experienced a historical maximum abundance in 1972 following a strong recruitment event in 1970; biomass was estimated to be 200,000 tonnes in 1972 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). However, since 1982, this species has substantially declined in the Yellow Sea due to a series of very weak year classes (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The catch decreased to below 1,000 tonnes in 1989 – 1990 and no fishing took place until at least 2000 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Currently, it is listed as a species of special concern in the Yellow Sea as abundance has decreased significantly and it requires protection and enhancement programs (National Fisheries Research and Development Institute 1988 as cited in Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>  <p>Overall, nearly all herring in the northwestern Pacific have undergone long-term periods of extreme fluctuations in the past; during periods of active fishing most stocks have declined to a state of depression or even collapse. However, based on the most recent estimates available (prior to 2001), most stocks have recovered to the point where abundance equaled or exceeded historical estimates. Pacific herring within the Hokkaido-Sakhalin and Yellow Sea regions are of concern as its abundance has remained severely depleted in the most recent years available. </p>  <p><strong><u>NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC </u></strong></p>  <p>In contrast to the northwestern Pacific, where this species is found in a few, large subpopulations, in the northeastern Pacific, it consists of a large number of (&gt;20) relatively small subpopulations (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001a), many of which have long-term time series data available that continue to the present. For the purposes of this assessment, the delineation of this species within the northeastern Pacific encompasses its geographic distribution throughout western U.S. and Canadian territories, from Alaska, south to California. Available species-specific information regarding the northeastern Pacific is described below.</p>  <p><strong><u>Alaska (U.S.)</u></strong><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Western Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>Arctic – Yukon – Kuskokwim (AYK) region: </u></em>Projected 2018 biomass for the Arctic – Yukon – Kuskokwim region (Norton Sound south to Security Cove) was estimated to be 54,782 tonnes (ADF&amp;G 2018a). The largest abundance of herring in the AYK region is in the Norton Sound district (Menard <em>et al. </em>2017); projected biomass for this district in 2018 is 30,775 tonnes, which makes up over half of the total projected biomass for the AYK region (57,782 tonnes: ADF&amp;G 2018a). Total allowable harvest is 10,683 tonnes. Commercial fishing may occur in this region in 2018 given that all preseason projected biomass thresholds are expected to be exceeded (ADF&amp;G 2018a). However, based on limited fishing effort from previous years and a lack of market interest in the region since 2006, only a small portion of the total allowable catch is anticipated to be taken in 2018 (ADF&amp;G 2018a). A commercial fishery is not anticipated in the Kuskokwim district due to a lack of market interest; a small commercial bait fishery is anticipated out of Norton Sound in 2018 (ADF&amp;G 2018a). Catch monitoring will be implemented if commercial fishing occurs (ADF&amp;G 2018a). </p>  <p><em><u>Togiak District (Bristol Bay)</u></em><u>: </u>The preseason biomass forecast for 2018 in the Togiak district was projected to be 124,062 tonnes, which is considered healthy and stable (ADF&amp;G 2018b). Herring in the Togiak district are commercially harvested for sac roe, spawn on kelp, as well as for food and bait; the herring fishery in this district is the largest in Alaska (ADF&amp;G 2018b). The commercial sac roe fishery was opened in this region in 2018; however, no commercial harvest of spawn on kelp took place in 2017 due to a lack of commercial interest (ADF&amp;G 2018b). </p>  <p>Overall, the recent abundance in the Bering Sea (early 2000s), based mainly on SSB estimated from the Togiak district, is much lower (~140,000 tonnes) than the highest estimate of nearly 500,000 tonnes in 1985 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The abundance of the many smaller stocks in the same region showed no clear trends in time (Hay <em>et al</em>. 2001a). </p>  <p><strong><em>Central Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p>Information from Central Alaska is available from the Prince William Sound district. A Bayesian assessment of this species within the Prince William Sound was conducted using biomass data up to 2013; findings indicate that abundance remains at low levels in recent years (Muradian <em>et al. </em>2017). Aerial survey acoustic estimates of SSB from 1973 – 2016 agree with the Bayesian assessment; SSB, although stable, has remained at very low levels since the mid- to late-1990s following a drastic decline in the late 1980s (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). All commercial fisheries for this species in the Prince William Sound have remained closed for 17 consecutive years because age structure and the available surplus in the spawning biomass currently does not support a fishery in this region (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). </p>  <p><strong><em>Southeast Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p>Long-term time series of SSB estimates are available for most stocks within Southeast Alaska, including Sitka Sound, Lynn Canal, Seymour Canal, Craig, Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay- Port Houghton, Hoonah Sound, Revilla Channel (including Kah Shakes- Cat Island and Annette Island Reserve), Seymour Canal, West Behm Canal and Tenakee Inlet (Hebert 2017). Stocks in southeastern Alaska have asynchronous SSB trends; some stocks have declined in the most recent 15 years available (e.g., Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay – Port Houghton, Hoonah Sound, Seymour Canal, Tenakee Inlet), while others have remained stable (e.g., Sitka Sound, Revilla Channel, West Behm Canal), or increased (e.g., Lynn Canal, Craig). Overall, combined SSB estimates show a fluctuating pattern in the most recent 15 years (2003 – 2017) with a declining trend since the most recent peak (2011); however, SSB appears to have stabilized at a low level in the most recent 4 – 5 years available (Hebert 2017). The total combined SSB estimates in 2017 for all of Southeast Alaska as calculated from spawn deposition estimates was 62,457 tonnes and is at a similar level to that of the late 1990s (Hebert 2017). Overall, the relatively stable pattern between 2016 and 2017 SSB estimates can be largely attributed to changes in the two largest stocks, which typically account for about 80 % of the total SSB in southeastern Alaska – Sitka Sound showed a decline of approximately 41 % between 2016 and 2017, while Craig showed an increase in 2017 roughly double that of 2016 (Hebert 2017). Despite overall stability in the most recent 4 – 5 years, there was a decline between 2016 and 2017 (~ 26 %). However, several areas (i.e., Lynn Canal, West Behm Canal, Revilla Channel, Tenakee Inlet, Ernest Sound, Hoonah Sound and Hobart Bay-Port Houghton) were not surveyed in 2017 and this may have led to some of the discrepancy between the two years (Hebert 2017). Combined spawn deposition estimates for 2017 suggest that SSB in southeast Alaska is at a moderate level relative to the period 1980 – 2016 (Hebert 2017). The combined SSB estimate of 62,457 tonnes is about 67 % of the mean SSB (1980 – 2016); however, this is considered to be an underestimate because several areas were not surveyed in 2017 (Hebert 2017). </p>  <p><strong><u>British Columbia (Canada)</u></strong></p>  <p>This species in British Columbian waters is divided into five major stock areas that are assessed regularly: Haida Gwaii (HG), Prince Rupert District (PRD), Central Coast (CC), Strait of Georgia (SOG), and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI); and two minor stock areas: Haida Gwaii Area 2W and WCVI Area 27 (DFO 2018). Each major stock area is made up of numerous smaller spawning groups (D. Hay, pers. comm. January 2019). Spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates are available for the five major stocks until 2017 and estimates have been projected to forecast the 2018 SSB (DFO 2018). In general, all five major stocks show a decline in weight-at-age from the mid-1980s to 2010, with a leveling off or slight increase in the most recent five years available (2012 – 2017: DFO 2018, Hay <em>et al. </em>2019). Stocks within the Haida Gwaii and West of Vancouver Island regions, however, continue to show a declining SSB trend in recent years (DFO 2018). Additionally, there is a large portion of the British Columbian coast (e.g., Johnstone Strait) where many small spawning groups exist but are not assessed regularly and no commercial fisheries occur (D. Hay, pers. comm. January 2019). In this region, herring predominantly reach maturity at age three (DFO 2018). </p>  <p>&#160;<strong><em>Haida Gwaii:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB have remained low in the most recent years available, including 2017; two models estimate a declining trend in SSB since 2013 (DFO 2018). Additionally, since 2000, the Haida Gwaii stock has been in a low productivity, low biomass state, which indicates a negative stock growth (DFO 2018). Median estimated SSB in 2017 was 3,963 tonnes and the projected median pre-fishery SSB estimate for 2018 is similar to the 2017 level (4,367 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Prince Rupert District:</em></strong></p>  <p>This stock has been characterized by two periods of consistent and stable spawning biomass: 1996 – 2003 and 2006 – 2007 (DFO 2018). Since 2005, estimated SSB productions have been positive, indicating stock growth (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 21,738 tonnes and the projected median pre-fishery SSB for 2018 is similar to 2017 (23,924 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Central Coast:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB show an increasing trend since 2012, including 2017 (DFO 2018). Since 2012, estimated SSB production for the Central Coast stock has been positive, indicating stock growth (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 30,474 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 is similar to 2017 (32,458 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Strait of Georgia:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB show an increasing trend since 2010 (DFO 2018). Since 2008, estimated SSB production for the Strait of Georgia stock has been positive, indicating stock growth. The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 114,626 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 are similar to 2017 (125,285 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI):</em></strong></p>  <p>In most years since 2005, including between 2016 and 2017, the WCVI stock has been in a prolonged low productivity, low biomass state, indicating negative stock growth (DFO 2018). Given a decline in estimated SSB, WCVI has been closed to fisheries since 2006, with the exception of the spawn on kelp (SOK) fishery permitted in 2011 (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 17,742 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 are similar to 2017 (20,003 tonnes: DFO 2018). </p>  <p><strong><u>Washington (U.S.)</u></strong></p>  <p>This species is separated into 21 small stocks within four major stock regions in inland Washington waters, including north Puget Sound, south-central Puget Sound, Hood Canal, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca (combined, these areas are now referred to as the “southern Salish Sea”). In this region, only the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks can be genetically differentiated; the other herring stocks have not shown genetic divergence, suggesting adequate gene flow (WDFW, 2018a). </p>  <p>Spawning stock data are available for most stocks through 2018 (WDFW 2018b). Stocks can fall into one of seven categories based on the previous 4 – year mean abundance compared to long-term previous 25 – year abundance (Stick <em>et al.</em> 2014): <strong>Increasing</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance more than 20% above the 25-year mean; <strong>Healthy</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance within 20% of the 25-year mean; <strong>Declining</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 21-50% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Depressed</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 51-80% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Critical</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 81-99% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Undetected</strong> - A stock that can no longer be found in a formerly consistently utilized spawning ground for four consecutive years; <strong>Unknown</strong>- Insufficient assessment data to identify stock status with confidence. Overall, 19% of stocks were listed as Increasing or Healthy in 2016, though the percentage of stocks listed as such has steadily declined over the years available (e.g., 38% in 2000: WDFW 2018b). Currently, three stocks are listed as Increasing (i.e., Quilcene Bay, Samish/Portage Bay and Semiahmoo Bay), one as Healthy (i.e., South Hood Canal), two as Declining&#160; (i.e., Holmes Harbor, Dungeness/Sequim Bay), two as Depressed (Squaxin Pass and Skagit Bay), and ten as Critical (Wallochet Bay, Quartermaster Harbor, Port Orchard-Port Madison, Port Susan, Port Gamble, Killisut Harbor, Discovery Bay, Interior San Juan Islands, Fildalgo Bay and Cherry Point). Three other stocks currently have Unknown status (Purdy, Elliot Bay, Northwest San Juan Islands) due to a lack of long-term data (WDFW 2018b). Excluding the genetically distinct stocks (i.e., Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass), all other Washington herring stocks combined reportedly have a Healthy standing overall (WDFW 2018b), although this is driven by the rapidly expanding Quilcene Bay stock, which currently makes up over 50% of the total estimated spawning biomass. If Quilcene Bay is excluded from the overall total, the remaining stocks are collectively considered to be Declining. Individual stocks listed as Critical (especially the genetically distinct Cherry Point stock which has declined more than 96% since the initial SSB estimate in 1973: WDFW 2018b) are of concern in Washington. </p>  <p>Overall, estimated SSB for all stocks within the Puget Sound has shown a fluctuating trend with an average just under 11,800 tonnes throughout the available time series (1973 – 2017: WDFW 2018b). Using the most recent 15-year window available (2003 – 2017), estimated SSB has declined from 12,287 tonnes in 2003 to 7,790 tonnes in 2017, which represents an approximate 37 % decline within three generations.</p>  <p>There is a limited commercial fishery for herring in Puget Sound which targets 2-3 year old fish for the sport bait market. Over the past decade this fishery has taken an average of 6% of the total estimated biomass for all stocks; no fishing is allowed north of Admiralty Inlet or south of the Tacoma Narrows to protect the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks.</p>  <p><strong><em>Puget Sound:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>Northern Puget Sound (including Cherry Point): </u></em>The Northern Puget Sound region includes the Fidalgo Bay, Samish/Portage Bay, Interior San Juan Islands, NW San Juan Islands, Semiahmoo Bay and Cherry Point stocks. The Cherry Point stock has shown genetic divergence from the remaining stocks (WDFW 2018a) and is of particular concern in this region. The Cherry Point stock status has been listed as Critical since 2000 and has shown a declining trend (greater than 96 %) in SSB estimates since the beginning of the available time series in 1973 (WDFW 2018b).</p>  <p><em><u>South/Central Puget Sound (including Squaxin Pass): </u></em>The South-Central Puget Sound region includes the Purdy, Wollochet Bay, Quartermaster Harbor, Elliot Bay, Port Orchard-Port Madison, South Hood Canal, Quilcene Bay, Port Gamble, Kilisut Harbor, Port Susan, Holmes Harbor, Skagit Bay and Squaxin Pass stocks. The Squaxin Pass stock has shown genetic divergence from the remaining stocks (WDFW 2018a) and is currently in a Depressed state (WDFW 2018b). Of particular concern are the stocks recently reported to be in a Critical condition (i.e., Quartermaster Harbor, Wollochet Bay, and Port Orchard-Port Madison).</p>  <p><strong><em>Strait of Juan de Fuca:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>The Strait of Juan de Fuca:</u></em> includes the Kilisut Harbor, Discovery Bay and Dungeness/Sequim Bay stocks. The Discovery Bay stock has been in a Depressed or Critical state since 1996 and remains Critical in 2016. The Dungeness/Sequim Bay stock was reported to be Increasing in 2000 but has been either Declining or Critical since that time. The Kilisut Harbor stock has also declined since 2000, with no spawn detected from 2009-2012 (a Disappearance event), but spawning has returned and the stock was listed as Critical in 2016. </p>  <p><strong><u>Oregon (U.S.)</u></strong></p>  <p>In Oregon, SSB is estimated from the number of spawning adults surveyed in the previous year (Baraff and Loughlin 2000). Biomass estimates exist from Yaquina Bay, Oregon from 1979 – 2011 with a mean of 487 +/- 501 tonnes over a 31 year time series (Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017). Despite an overall decline in SSB estimates throughout the available time series, within the most recent fifteen years available (1997 – 2011), SSB estimates have largely fluctuated but show a 2 – 3 fold increase overall. </p>  <p><strong><u>California (U.S.)</u></strong><strong> </strong></p>  <p>The four largest spawning areas in California are San Francisco Bay, Tomales Bay, Humboldt Bay and Crescent City Harbor (Hay <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 2001a); however, little to no information is available from Tomales Bay, Humbolt Bay, and Crescent City Harbor. </p>  <p><strong><em>San Francisco Bay: </em></strong></p>  <p>Long-term time series of SSB estimates are available from San Francisco Bay (1979 – 2018) with an average of 44,000 tonnes (CDFW 2018). The SSB estimate in 2017 – 18 was 13,879 tonnes which represents the fourth year in a row of below average estimated SSB (CDFW 2018). </p>  <p>Commercial fishing of this species within San Francisco Bay continued during the 2017 – 18 season at a low level of effort relative to historical levels, which coincided with an estimated SSB well below the long-term average and the fourth year of low overall returns for this fishery (CDFW 2018). Low SSB estimates likely reflect sustained impacts from El Niño conditions (i.e., high sea-surface temperatures and depressed productivity in the California Current Ecosystem: CDFW 2018). </p>  <p>In the most recent 15 years available (2003-04 – 2017-18), SSB has fluctuated with an average of about 37,920 tonnes, but shows a declining trend overall. Estimated SSB in 2003-04 was 31,207 tonnes and has declined to about 13,879 tonnes in 2017-18, representing a decline of 55.5 % within 15 years (thought to represent three generation lengths for this species).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is widely distributed throughout the Arctic and northern Pacific Oceans. It occurs in the Arctic from the White Sea, east to the Ob Inlet, and the Beaufort Sea to the Amundsen Gulf off the Yukon, Northern and Nunavut Territories. In the Pacific, this species occurs in the northwest region from the Bering Sea, including the Anadyr Bay and the eastern coast of Kamchatka, south to&#160; northern Japan, and the western coast of Korea; and in the northeast region throughout the Gulf of Alaska including off the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, south along the coast of Washington, Oregon and California to northern Baja, California (Tester 1937, Whitehead 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Coad and Reist 2004, Kim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017). This species has been included in a checklist of fishes from Shandong, China (Cheng and Zhou 1997); however, this requires verification. This species occupies a depth range of 0 - 475 m (Coad and Reist 2004).<strong></strong></p>","<p></p><p>This species is exploited with varying intensity throughout a majority of its geographic distribution. Level of harvest ranges from heavy exploitation in industrial and commercial fisheries to areas of no exploitation such as various small subpopulations within the northeastern Pacific, including those fisheries which have closed due to a low SSB (i.e., Prince William Sound, Alaska: Russell <em>et al. </em>2017) or lack of market interest (i.e., Norton Sound, Alaska: Menard <em>et al. </em>2017). This species appears to be less important in Arctic regions, but in general, it is a highly important commercial species in both western and eastern Pacific regions (Whitehead 1985, Coad and Reist 2004, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat 2009, Schweigert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;McKechnie and Smith 2013, McKechnie<em> et al</em>. 2014). It is regarded as the second most important targeted species in the northwest Pacific (Zeller <em>et al. </em>2018); it is one of several important commercial species targeted in Russian Far East territory. This species has been taken in industrial trawl fisheries since the early 1900s but also contributes small quantities to bycatch in trawl, seine and longline industrial fisheries that target other important species such as Alaska pollock, cod and various flatfishes (&lt;3 %: Sobolevskaya and Divovich 2015). It is also taken in commercial purse seine and gill net sac roe, spawn on kelp and other food and bait fisheries (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). It likely also contributes to bycatch throughout its range. </p><br/><p></p>",Marine,"<p>Given this species ecological and commercial importance, species-specific stock management regulations are in place in parts of its range (e.g., British Columbia, Alaska) such as yearly fishery closures, stock-specific management plans including yearly stock assessments, catch quotas, harvest rates, and biomass reference points (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2010, Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2017, Menard <em>et al.</em> 2017). For example, in British Columbia, this species is fished with a 20% harvest rate and commercial fishery threshold (Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2010). During periods of low abundance, closures are implemented in some regions. For example, no commercial removal is currently allowed from the Haida Gwaii, central coast and western coast of Vancouver Island stocks (Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2017). Also, all commercial fisheries for this species in the Prince William Sound have remained closed for 17 consecutive years because age structure and the available surplus in the spawning biomass currently does not support a fishery in this region (Russell <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species geographic distribution also overlaps with many existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). More information in needed to determine how this species is impacted by food availability and climatic variation especially regarding larval and juvenile herring. <strong></strong></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The diet is largely green vegetation, with Sandberg's bluegrass (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Poa secunda</span>), western tansymustard (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Descurainia pinnata</span>), lupine (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lupinus laxiflorus</span>) and woollypod milkvetch (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Astragalus purshii</span>) occurring most frequently in their diet (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife 2011).

This produced a severe bottleneck that significantly reduced genetic variability. For most of the twentieth century, numbers continued to decline mostly as a consequence of human invasion of habitat and adverse fishing interactions. This resulted in the fragmentation of the species into many subpopulations and the disappearance of several of them. There is evidence for recent small increases in Mediterranean Monk Seals at each of the main three identified subpopulations, but their numbers remain very small. The number of mature individuals in the eastern Mediterranean (the largest subpopulation) is likely fewer than 250, and 100-200 occurring in the other known subpopulations.<br/><br/>Monk Seals continue to be exposed to a number of substantial threats, including habitat loss and deterioration, displacement and persecution. Unpredictable threats from disease and toxic algal blooms (red tides) also pose a threat to the remaining small population, as exemplified by the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco when more than 200 animals died in one mass-mortality event in 1997.<br/><br/>With the advantage of new data being available for this species, it is now thought that the previous assessment (Critically Endangered A2abc: Aguilar and Lowry 2008) was an overestimate of the scale of decline in the global population over the previous 33 years, since most of the reduction in population size likely happened more than three generations ago. Endangered (EN C2a(i)) would have been a more appropriate assessment at that time. It is clear that the population size has been reduced to below the IUCN threshold for EN under criterion C: currently the population contains 350-450 mature individuals, with less than 250 mature animals in the largest subpopulation. There is evidence of recent small increases in each of the main three subpopulations, however it is not clear when this increasing trend began or whether this trend is likely to continue into the future. Continuing decline in population size is therefore retained as a precautionary approach for this assessment. It is important to monitor the situation over the next five years to establish whether the population is genuinely increasing and whether this increase is likely to continue into the future. Maintaining and adding to conservation measures that are already in place for this species will help to secure its future. The species is here listed as Endangered (EN C2a(i)), and reassessment of its status in five years’ time is recommended.","Mediterranean Monk Seals are medium-sized phocids that reach 2.3-2.8 m in length (Gilmartin and Forcada 2002). Based on seals examined after a mass mortality at Cabo Blanco, average adult lengths were estimated at 2.42 m in females and 2.51 m in males. Pups up to 3 months of age averaged 1.08 m with a range of 0.74-1.38 m (Samaranch and Gonzalez 2000). In the eastern Mediterranean, newborn pups averaged 102.6 cm in length (i.e., total length from the snout to the end of the hind flippers; N = 8, SD = 10.74) and 15.5 kg in weight (N = 3, SD = 1.5; Dendrinos 2011). Adults weigh from 240-300 kg, and newborns 15-26 kg (Boulva 1979, Gilmartin and Forcada 2002), with records of a male reaching 400 kg and a pregnant female reaching 302 kg (Sergeant <em>et al</em>. 1978).<br/><br/>Adult females moult an average of 134 days after parturition, and sometimes begin the moult prior weaning their pup (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). In males, the process of developing the mature pelage pattern is gradual; it involves at least two annual moults and can be completed by the age of 4 years (Badosa <em>et al</em>. 2006). Mediterranean Monk Seal pups at the Cabo Blanco region moult on average 64 days after birth in the case of females and on average 82 days in the case of males; the molt occurs partly in the water and takes an average of 15 days to be completed (Badosa <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the eastern Mediterranean in contrast the first molt occurred 19-57 days postpartum (N = 16; Mean 37.5 days, SD = 9.85; Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals once hauled out on open beaches (Johnson and Lavigne 1999b, Johnson 2004) but today they use marine caves with sea entrances for hauling out, resting and pupping throughout their range. In recent years in areas where conservation measures are in place and/or human activity is low, such as the protected areas at Cabo Blanco (Gilmartin and Forcada 2002, Fernandez de Larrinoa <em>et al</em>. 2007, P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.), the Desertas Islands Nature Reserve (Pires and Neves 2000) and the island of Gyaros (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2008), Monk Seals are frequently observed to haul out on open beaches. On some occasions even births on open beaches have been recorded in these areas.<br/><br/>Most marine caves used by Mediterranean Monk Seals for resting and pupping possess a set of common geophysical characteristics, that include an entrance above or below water level, an entrance corridor, and a dry surface/area, where the seals haul out (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2007b). Seal preferences regarding the use of a cave as a resting or pupping site are influenced by these parameters (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2004). Cave selection (i.e., usage frequency and intensity) may also be influenced by changes in the internal morphology of a cave, as has been seen to occur at Cabo Blanco (González <em>et al</em>. 1997) or the state of the tide (only in the Atlantic populations, as tides in the Mediterranean are negligible) (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>A major difference in the terrestrial habitat of Mediterranean Monk Seals occupying the area of Cabo Blanco and the rest of their range is the number of marine caves used by the species. Whereas in Cabo Blanco, the entire Monk Seal population uses a small number (&lt;5) of marine caves for resting and pupping (Marchessaux and Muller 1987, Francour <em>et al</em>. 1990, González <em>et al</em>. 1997, Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012) in the archipelago of Madeira (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2004) and in the eastern Mediterranean this number is much higher (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004; MOm 2007, 2008, 2009). In a study that covered 250 km of coastline inhabited by Monk Seals in the Cilician Basin region of southern Turkey, 282 caves were searched. Of these, 39 showed evidence of Monk Seals, including three that were used for pupping and 16 that were actively being used at the time of the survey (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004). Similarly, in Greece more than 500 caves have been found to be occupied by the species and more than 100 to be used for pupping (MOm 2007, 2008, 2009). Monk Seal activity in the marine caves in the eastern Mediterranean is highest in autumn and winter and coincides with the pupping season of the species (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004, Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>In the Cabo Blanco region prior to the mass die off in 1997, most pups were born from summer to early winter, with a small peak of births in October; 84% of the births took place in only two caves separated by 1.1 km (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 1999, Pastor and Aguilar 2003). Following the mass die-off a change in the reproductive parameters of the colony was registered (González <em>et al</em>. 2002): currently births are recorded from April to November, with a clear peak in September (Cedenilla <em>et al</em>. 2007). In all other parts of the species range, pupping appears to be even more synchronous. In the archipelago of Madeira most pups have been recorded in the months October and November (i.e., 38 out of 48 recorded from 1989 to 2012; Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. Pires pers. comm). The same pupping season was recorded for 11 pups born at Turkey’s Cilician Basin and for more than 220 pups born in Greece from 1990 to 2014 (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1999; Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>Pups begin to catch fish toward the end of their lactation period (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). Pups are weaned when they are about four months old, with up to five months reported (Pastor and Aguilar 2003, Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fostering and milk stealing are not uncommon and have been recorded at Cabo Blanco (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007), Madeira (Pires 2004), and in Greece (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2012). At the Cabo Blanco colony, in 26.6% of the suckling episodes observed in mother–pup pairs of known identity, pups suckled from females other than their mothers. Some females nursed more than one pup, at least occasionally, and in some cases a pup was fostered long-term by an unrelated female (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Pups enter the water and begin diving during their first week and from that point onwards spend 55-74% of their time at sea (Dendrinos 2011). Three pups tagged with time depth recorders spent more time at sea and diving at night than during the day; most dives were to the bottom for relatively long periods, probably indicating foraging. The mean depth of dive was 11.6 m and its mean length was 149 seconds (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the Northern Sporades Islands in Greece, two rehabilitated weaned pups dived on average to greater depths and even managed to dive to a depth of 200 m (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007a).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is 11.2 years (Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Female Mediterranean Monk Seals probably become sexually mature at 3-4 years of age. One female at Cabo Blanco became pregnant at 2.1 years and gave birth at 3.1 years, the youngest age known for this species (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). Females can give birth in successive years. Although birthing is not strictly seasonal, individual females have been documented to give birth close to the same time in successive years, within a 15 day span (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). The annual reproductive rate in Mediterranean Monk Seals at Cabo Blanco prior to the mass die-off was extremely low, at 0.25-0.43 pups to each sexually mature female (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2000). Since the mass die-off event the population appears to be recovering and currently annual reproductive rates average 0.76 pups/adult female (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). Females caring for pups will go to sea to feed for up to 17 hours, with an average time of 9 hours (Gazo and Aguilar 2005). Females tend to forage longer further into nursing.<br/><br/>Prior to the mass mortality event, pup survival at Cabo Blanco was extremely low; just under 50% of the pups born annually managed to survive their first two months, and most mortalities occurred in the first two weeks. This very low survival rate was associated with mortality caused by severe storms, and high swells and tides, but impoverished genetic variability and inbreeding might also have been factors (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 2000). Currently, annual pup survival has increased considerably and numbers 65% (54-76%, depending on weather conditions; P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). In Greece annual pup survival appears to be even higher (Dendrinos 2011); this is most likely due to the fact that lactating females and their pups have a higher number of suitable caves to choose from when seeking refuge from severe weather conditions.<br/><br/>Compared to most other pinnipeds, little is known about the diving capacities and behavior of Mediterranean Monk Seals. The maximum depth and duration of diving for one lactating female were 78 m and 15 minutes, respectively (Gazo and Aguilar 2005) and 100 m for an adult male (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). However, diving behaviour of Monk Seals at Cabo Blanco appears to be constricted by the topographic features of the marine environment in the region, as Monk Seals in the Mediterranean Sea (which is much deeper than the Cabo Blanco region) have been recorded to dive much deeper. Maximum dive depths for a rehabilitated male and a female juvenile Monk Seal were 196 m (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2007a) and 205 m (MOm unpublished data), respectively. Neves (1998) observed two types of diving in shallow near-shore waters, which are thought to be associated with “spot resting” and “transit feeding”. When “spot resting”, seals dove as though headed into a current for 8-12 minutes, surfaced at about the same location, and usually repeated this pattern for approximately three hours. Underwater observations by divers indicate that while doing this seals rest at the bottom of the sea (R. Pires pers. comm). Transit feeding dives lasted 5-7 minutes, during which the seal moved continuously along a shoreline apparently foraging. A similar behaviour has been observed in Turkey, where adult Monk Seals dove for approximately 6.5 minutes and rested at the surface for approximately one minute (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2002). Monk seals in the eastern Mediterranean have been recorded to travel long distances, for example ~288 km in three months with a maximum straight distance travelled of ~78 km (Adamantopoulou <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Stomach content analysis of dead Monk Seals has revealed that they have a heterogeneous diet consisting of bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. In Greece, Monk Seals are known to eat more than 70 prey species (50% cephalopods, 48% fishes, 1.5% non-cephalopod molluscs, 0.4% crustaceans; Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011). The common octopus (<em>Octopus vulgari</em>s ~34%) and bony fish from the family Sparidae (~28%) were identified in Monk Seal stomachs most frequently (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the Atlantic, at the Desertas Islands off Madeira, visual observations of Monk Seals with prey at the surface included seals eating Golden-grey Mullet (<em>Liza aurata</em>), Parrot Fish (<em>Sparisoma cretense</em>), Barred Hogfish (<em>Bodianus scrofa</em>), Salema (<em>Sarpa salpa</em>), Cuttlefish (<em>Sepia officinalis</em>) and Crabs (<em>Pachygrapsus</em> spp.). Other prey reported includes Eels (<em>Anguilla</em> spp.), Limpets (<em>Patella</em> spp.) and Rays (<em>Raja</em> spp.) (Neves 1998). In Cabo Blanco, stomach content analyses indicated that 71.3% of prey items by weight were cephalopods and 68.3% were Octopus. Fish species were mainly from the families Sparidae, Scianidae and Haemulidae (Muñoz Cañas <em>et al</em>. 2012). Collectively, results from stomach content (Marchessaux 1989, Neves 1998, Salman <em>et al</em>. 2001, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011, Muñoz Cañas <em>et al</em>. 2012) and stable isotope analyses (Pinela <em>et al</em>. 2010, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2014b) studies suggest that Monk Seals forage primarily on the continental shelf along the coast.","The Mediterranean Monk Seal is one of the most endangered pinniped species, and one of the most endangered Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) mammals on Earth (Isaac <em>et al</em>. 2007, <a href=""http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=27"">EDGE</a> web site).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals have a long history of interaction with humans that includes exploitation for subsistence needs, commercial harvest, and persecution as a competitor for fisheries resources or because it produced actual and perceived damage to fishing gear (Johnson and Lavigne 1999b, Stringer <em>et al</em>. 2008). Once abundant, Monk Seals were written about and illustrated in the literature and depictions of classical antiquity (Johnson 2004). Along the coast of northwest Africa, they became the target of a commercial harvest for skins and oil by the Portuguese as early as the 15th century (Isräels 1992).<br/><br/>Reasons for population decline declines in the 20th century include: increased human pressure displacing seals from their habitat; destruction/alteration of suitable habitat; continued mortality due to deliberate aggression by fishermen to eliminate a competitor, even in countries and areas where the species is legally protected; fisheries by-catch; and a mass die-off at the Cabo Blanco Monk Seal colony.<br/><br/>Habitat deterioration, destruction, and fragmentation have played a significant role in the plight of the Mediterranean Monk Seal. Once an open beach dweller, the species has been persecuted by humans for centuries and forced to occupy increasingly marginal habitat. The gradual process from occupying open beaches to being displaced and forced into increasingly marginal habitat (i.e., smaller and more unsuitable marine caves) has been thoroughly documented (Johnson and Lavigne 1999a). This threat is still in place today, particularly in the eastern Mediterranean (MOm 2007, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013). An alarming decline in pupping success has been recorded in the most important pupping location of the species in southern Turkey (where up to seven pup births have been recorded) due to increased human activity (i.e., industrial development, including the construction of a thermal and nuclear power plant and a marine terminal). Critical Monk Seal habitat has been affected by increased tourism activities throughout Turkey, even in protected areas such as the Olympos Beydagları National Park, and the Kas, Kekova Specially Protected Area. Tourists and scuba divers in these areas appear to frequently visit Monk Seal shelters. Although some resting activity of Mediterranean Monk Seals continues, no pupping activity has been recorded in these caves (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2009). With human populations and coastal activities increasing around the Mediterranean, so do potential threats to the species habitat.<br/><br/>Interactions with fisheries are of great conservation concern, throughout the species range (Güçlüsoy and Savas 2003, Güçlüsoy 2008, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hale <em>et al</em>. 2011, González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2013). Deliberate killing of Monk Seals mainly by fishermen was responsible for one-third of all mortalities of 79 stranded animals in Greece (1991-1995) and is considered the single most important source of mortality for this species in the eastern Mediterranean (Androukaki <em>et al</em>. 1999). Deliberate killing, hunting, and capturing live animals for exhibition purposes were the main cause for the population reduction of the species in Turkey until 1980 (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals have been entangled in a wide variety of fishing gear including set-nets, trawl nets, and long-lines (Johnson and Karamanlidis 2000) and entanglement remains a major source of mortality in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, especially for sub-adult animals (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013). Adverse fishing interactions are also considered as one of the probable causes for the lack of recovery of the Cabo Blanco population after commercial sealing ended in the region. Currently, illegal industrial and artisanal fishing is one of the main threats to the survival of the colony, mainly for sub-adult seals (González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2013). In comparison, the effect of negative seal-fisheries interactions in the archipelago of Madeira is considered to be lower. Traps, purse seines, and illegally used gill nets are the main fishing gear posing a threat to the species in the region (Hale <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, concurrent with the recent expansion of the species’ range to the island of Madeira, signs of animosity towards the species by fishermen have been recorded, that potentially could pose a future threat (R. Pires pers. comm).<br/><br/>A <em>Morbillivirus</em> was isolated from Mediterranean Monk Seals after the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco in 1997. The virus most closely resembled a Dolphin <em>Morbillivirus</em> that was previously implicated in the 1991 mass mortality of Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea (Osterhaus <em>et al</em>. 1992, van de Bildt <em>et al</em>. 1999). However, although this virus was already circulating in Monk Seals prior to the mass mortality, there is some doubt as to whether it was responsible for the deaths that occurred. Indeed, the active virus was found in pups that went into a rehabilitation center because their mothers had died, and none of them showed clinical signs and all survived the event without specific treatment. Dinoflagellate-produced saxitoxins were found in tissues from animals that died during the die-off and the suddenness of death of the animals and the general clinical symptoms suggest that the cause of death was from the toxins rather than a <em>Morbillivirus</em> epidemic (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1998). Toxic algal blooms (red tides) are favored by oceanographic conditions near Cabo Blanco and were reported from nearby Morocco during a 25-year period leading up to the mass mortality. Toxic algal blooms are unpredictable and following the catastrophic loss of Monk Seals in 1997 must be considered a serious threat to the species in the region (Reyero <em>et al</em>. 2000, UNEP 2005).<br/><br/>Potentially, limited availability of food sources, genetic inbreeding, and pollution could constitute a threat to the survival of the species. Currently, not enough information is available to fully evaluate the magnitude of these threats, however there is no indication that they are significantly affecting the population at present.<br/><br/>In southern Turkey an important monk seal colony almost disappeared in the 1990s, when industrial-scale fishing in the area reduced the available fish sources and negative interactions of artisanal fishermen with monk seals (i.e., deliberate killings) increased. However, a series of regulations enforced to protect fish sources alleviated the problems and helped the local monk seal population to resume pupping in the area (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Genetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2007, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2014a) have shown that, as a consequence of severe population bottlenecks and population/habitat fragmentation, all sub-populations have suffered a dramatic decrease in genetic variability over the last few centuries. The genetic diversity of Mediterranean Monk Seals is among the lowest found in pinnipeds; it is comparable to Hawaiian Monk Seals and Northern Elephant Seals. The potential consequences of the loss of genetic variability and genetic inbreeding are still hard to evaluate for the Mediterranean Monk Seal, however potential consequences of genetic inbreeding include congenital defects leading to stillborn pups, something that has been recorded in several small Monk Seal populations (Bareham and Furreddu 1975, Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2004, MOm, unpublished data). Additionally, low fitness and increased susceptibility to disease may be an effect of genetic erosion that can compromise a population and lead to extinction.<br/><br/>Contaminant burdens have always been suspected to be a threat to the Mediterranean Monk Seal and thus monitoring pollutants has been considered a high priority (Boulva 1979, Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, information is only available on organochlorine pollutants, which were analysed in the blubber of individuals collected during the 1990s from the Cabo Blanco and the Greek subpopulations. Residue levels were found to be very low in the former subpopulation and moderate to high in the latter (Yediler <em>et al</em>. 1993; Borrell <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2007); currently, efforts are underway to more fully evaluate the effects of pollution on the Mediterranean Monk Seal through the analysis of more recent samples from the eastern Mediterranean (Marsili <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zaccaroni <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals are at an unknown, but suspected high, level of risk from oil tanker and other ship accidents, spills, and groundings. This results from increased tanker traffic in the area, and a greater chance for accidents, disturbance, and collisions near important habitat. Four accidents or spills have occurred near Monk Seal habitat in the recent past, including a supertanker that spilled oil off Morocco in 1989 (Isräels 1992), an oil spill in the Madeira Islands in 1990 (UNEP 2005), and the grounding of a bulk carrier near Cabo Blanco in 2003 (UNEP 2005). None of these spills or accidents had any known impacts on Monk Seals, but they highlight the threat of significant impacts from a major maritime accident near an important Monk Seal site (UNEP 2005). In contrast, a ship accident that occurred at Çavuş Island near Bodrum in southwest Turkey in 1996 directly affected Monk Seals and their habitat (Kiraç 1998). A clean-up operation lasting until 1997 effectively restored the habitat to its original quality. In response to this accident regulatory measures have been taken in Turkey to reduce the threat from oil spills (Kiraç and Guclusoy 2007).<br/><br/>More recently, the arrival of Lessepsian fishes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, such as the toxic Pufferfish (<em>Lagocephalus sceleratus</em>), could have a negative impact on Monk Seals in the region. The Pufferfish has been implicated in the death of a Monk Seal at Cyprus (A. Gücü pers. comm). Additional risks to Mediterranean Monk Seals come from political instability in some parts of their range, the challenge of implementing effective conservation for a species in a complex multi-national environment, weak enforcement of agreements and international laws, collapse of occupied pupping caves, and reduction of the carrying capacity of the environment as a consequence of fishing overexploitation (Aguilar 1999).","The once abundant Mediterranean Monk Seal has disappeared from most of its former range, with the majority of the decline in the global population seen over the last century having occurred more than three generations ago.<br/><br/>Conservation measures introduced over the last 30 years have helped to stem the decline, and there is now evidence of recent small increases in all known subpopulations. However at present it is not clear whether these increases are likely to continue into the future. The Mediterranean Monk Seal population remains very small and still faces many threats (see the Threats section below). It is regarded as one of the most endangered pinniped species in the  world, with approximately 600-700 animals in the population (an estimated 350-450 of these are mature individuals). The population has also been fragmented into 3–4 subpopulations:<br/><ul><li>The largest subpopulation is located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and numbers 350-450 individuals (including mature and immature individuals). It is estimated that 300–400 live in Greece (MOm 2007, 2008, 2009) and about 100 in Turkey (Güçlüsoy <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on data from the closest extant relative of the Mediterranean Monk Seal (i.e., the Hawaiian Monk Seal) the number of mature individuals in the eastern Mediterranean is likely fewer than 250.</li></ul><ul><li>Approximately 220 seals currently inhabit the second largest subpopulation at the Cabo Blanco area. Recent monitoring efforts have individually identified at least 116 adult and sub-adult Monk Seals in this subpopulation (i.e., &gt;3 years old; Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012). Maximum counts of seals hauled-out at one time was 146 in 2009, and 159 individual adult seals were identified at the end of 2013 (CBD Habitat, P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm). In the early 1990s this subpopulation was estimated at about 317 seals but a mass mortality event in 1997 reduced numbers to nearly a third (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1999, Forcada and Aguilar 2000). Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated that there were 85 adult seals at Cabo Blanco in 2007.</li></ul><ul><li>The third subpopulation is located in the archipelago of Madeira and numbers approximately 40 seals (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. Pires pers. comm). Once restricted to the remote Desertas Islands (Neves and Pires 1999), Monk Seals have recently recolonized the main island of Madeira (Pires 2011), where suitable habitat for the species still exists (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2003). There are even strong indications of pupping on the island (R. Pires pers. comm).</li></ul><ul><li>The number of Mediterranean Monk Seals that might still survive at the Mediterranean coasts of eastern Morocco (and perhaps Algeria) is unknown (Mo <em>et al</em>. 2011).</li></ul>The subpopulations at Cabo Blanco in the Atlantic (Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012) and at the island of Gyaros in the eastern Mediterranean (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2013) are the only large extant aggregations of the species that still preserve the structure of a colony; the other subpopulations in the eastern Mediterranean are composed of loose groups of extremely reduced size (usually less than 20 individuals).<br/><br/>Monk Seals continue to be exposed to a number of substantial threats, as exemplified by the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco when more than 200 animals died in one mass-mortality event in 1997 (Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012). Such unpredictable threats could rapidly impact any or all of the subpopulations in future.",Increasing,"Mediterranean Monk Seals were once widely and continuously distributed in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and in the North Atlantic waters from Morocco to Cabo Blanco, including the Canary Islands, Madeira Islands and the Azores (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006). A few individuals have been recorded in Senegal, the Gambia and the Cape Verde Islands at the southern end, as well as in Portugal and Atlantic France at the northern end of the species' distribution (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006), but the origin of these individuals is unknown.<br/><br/>Today the distribution of the Mediterranean Monk Seal is highly fragmented and consists of 3–4 isolated subpopulations. In the Mediterranean Sea, the stronghold of the species is at islands in the Ionian and Aegean Seas (Adamantopoulou <em>et al</em>. 1999), and along the coasts of mainland Greece, Cyprus, and western and southern Turkey (Güçlüsoy <em>et al</em>. 2004; Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009; MOm 2007; Nikolaou pers. comm). In the Turkish Black Sea, Mediterranean Monk Seals are believed to be extinct since 1997 (Kiraç and Savas 1996, Kiraç 2011); some individuals still survive in the Sea of Marmara (Inanmaz <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the North Atlantic, two subpopulations exist: one at Cabo Blanco (also known as Cap Blanc) at the border of Mauritania and Western Sahara (Gonzáles and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2012, Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012), and one at the Archipelago of Madeira (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008). An unknown number of Monk Seals might still survive at the Mediterranean coasts of eastern Morocco (and perhaps Algeria) (Mo <em>et al</em>. 2011), but without ongoing systematic monitoring and conservation actions the status and fate of this subpopulation is in question.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for Mediterranean Monk seals is approximately 5,000,000 km² and the area of occupancy is 315,000 km².","In the past, Mediterranean Monk Seals were hunted by humans for their fur, oil, meat and for medicinal use. Evidence suggests that the species was severely depleted during the Roman era (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006). Today there is no commercial exploitation of this species.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Mediterranean Monk Seal is legally protected throughout its range through numerous national laws and regional and international treaties, as well as European Union regulations. Legislative measures and research, management, and conservation actions to effectively protect important Mediterranean Monk Seal populations are currently in place in the following areas: the Desertas Islands Nature Reserve in the Madeira Archipelago, the National Marine Park of Alonnisos, Northern Sporades Islands, the marine protected area in Northern Karpathos–Saria and the 3-mile no-take zone at the Island of Gyaros in Greece, the no-fishing area of the Cap Blanc Peninsula and the participative reserve that has been created to protect the pupping caves of the Cabo Blanco Monk Seal population. In Turkey similar actions are carried out in five coastal locations in the country: Foça, Karaburun, Alaçatı-Sigacik, the Bodrum Peninsula, and the Cilician coasts (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Additionally, the species is explicitly mentioned in 102 Natura 2000 sites within the European Union (82 sites in Greece, 10 in Italy, five in Spain, three in Portugal, and two in Cyprus). According to the Council’s Directive 92/43EEC “on the conservation of natural habitats of wild fauna and flora” the Mediterranean Monk Seal is considered as a species of community importance. Based on the above Directive, Natura 2000 sites are legally considered by EU member states as Protected Areas.<br/><br/>Throughout the range of the species, widespread action has been taken to sensitize the local human population towards Monk Seal conservation, to protect breeding caves, to restrict fishing gear and relocate the most adverse fishing practices, to develop monitoring programs and intervention protocols, and to increase on-site capability to rehabilitate sick and injured individuals, particularly pups. Numerous agreements, conventions, and treaties (on a regional, national, and international level) are in force to protect Monk Seals, and many workshops and conferences have brought together scientists and managers to discuss Monk Seal conservation issues and problems. Furthermore, numerous international bodies and fora, including the Regional Activity Center for Specially Protected Areas and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, have put forward initiatives and proposals in order to ameliorate existing threats and mitigate pressures from relevant sectors (i.e., fisheries, bycatch, etc.). Isräels (1992) summarized 30 years of this conservation history, and provided details on accomplishments and failures to meet objectives. Currently, there is a UNEP/Mediterranean Action Plan (first issued in 1978 and revised in 1988) in force for the conservation and management of Monk Seals in the Mediterranean and an Action Plan for the recovery of the Monk Seal in the eastern Atlantic under the Migratory Species of Wild Animals Convention (Bonn Convention) (González <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the context of the plan a list of actions have been implemented, such as the establishment of mechanisms to coordinate and finance the conservation, the population monitoring and study, habitat protection and environmental education.<br/><br/>In Greece, the “National strategy and action plan for the conservation of the Mediterranean Monk Seal in Greece, 2009-2015” (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2009) describes in detail actions that have to be carried out in the country by 2015 in order to safeguard the future of the species. Similarly, in Turkey the National Monk Seal Committee has drafted a “National Action Plan for the Conservation of Mediterranean Monk Seal <em>Monachus monachus</em> in Turkey” that has been approved by the Turkish Ministry of Forest and Water Works (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Recently a new Regional Strategy for the Conservation of the Mediterranean Monk Seal has been adopted also by the UNEP parties (Notarbartolo di Sciara 2013).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Characterised by blue and rust coloured spotting along the sides of the body, the species has two separate dorsal fins and a rounded tail fin (Wager and Unmack 2000, Hammer <em>et al. </em>2009).</p>  <p>The species inhabits small isolated freshwater waterholes in rocky creeks, and spring-fed pools in streams flowing through steep-sided valleys (Wager and Jackson 1993; Allen and Jenkins 1989). Permanent springs like Weetootla and Nepouie are most probably supplied from a large regional groundwater aquifer that allows the springs to continue to flow and withstand dry seasons and droughts, thus contributing to the continued survival of this fish species at springs within ephemeral creek-beds (McNeil<em> et al.</em> 2011). The Barcoo River population inhabits a mud-bottomed, lowland creek where it co-exists with about 10 other fish species (Unmack 2000). In Barcoo River and also the upper Belyando River, <em>M. clivicola</em> have been primarily found in areas with undercut banks and woody debris (Briggs <em>et al. </em>2018). In Balcanoona Creek, they are the only species present, and tend to occur throughout the available habitat which includes rocky substrates and other instream cover (Briggs<em> et al.</em> 2018).</p>  <p><em>Mogurnda</em> species are repeat spawners, with females able to produce up to 10 broods annually as long as food is constantly available (Pusey <em>et al.</em> 2004, M. Young pers. comm. 2016). <em>Mogurnda clivicola</em> are known to predominantly breed during spring and summer (Hammer <em>et al.</em> 2009), although it may be as late as May (McNeil <em>et al.</em> 2011). Spawning in the species is not associated with rainfall or flood events (McNeill <em>et al.</em> 2011). Based on natural observation and aquarium experiments, warm water (above 20°C) appears to be a key factor in initiating spawning (Pusey <em>et al. </em>2004, McNeil <em>et al. </em>2011). If this is the case, Weetootla and Nepouie Springs are the only sites in the area warm enough to support spawning in late autumn and winter (McNeil <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>  <p>Males prepare a site in which females lay egg masses of between 200 - 900 eggs (McNeil <em>et al.</em> 2011) on hard, vertical surfaces, which are fertilised by the males. Eggs are usually laid&#160;as a circular cluster, on the underside of a hard object (Unmack 2000). The male guards the eggs until&#160;they&#160;hatch in approximately seven days (dependant on temperatures). Fry (small, recently hatched fish) are approximately 5 mm long with limited swimming ability. Parental care after hatching is said to be minimal (Unmack 2000), however McNeil <em>et al.</em> (2011) observed a male actively chasing other fish away from young at Weetootla Spring. Juveniles reach full&#160;maturity and colouration at around five to six months of age or approximately 6-7 cm in length (Hammer e<em>t al.</em>&#160;2009). Young fish are more elongate than adults and become stouter as they grow. Upon reaching maturity, the species is said to be territorial and more cryptic than juveniles who, in contrast to the adults, utilise surface waters (Hammer <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p>  <p>The species is most probably an ambush predator, feeding on aquatic insects and microcrustaceans (Unmack 2000). Whilst the specific diet of <em>M. clivicola</em> is not known, they are likely to be opportunistic feeders, and have been observed eating caddisfly larvae, tadpoles and other small fish (Hammer <em>et al.</em> 2009, McNeil <em>et al.</em> 2011). Other members of the genus are also opportunistic, consuming worms, tadpoles, shrimp and small fish (including their own species) as well as the introduced species Gambusia (<em>Gambusia holbrooki</em>). They are also known to consume algae, pollen and miscellaneous forms of organic matter (DEWHA 2008).</p>  <p>An investigation by Roush (2016), into the suitability of potential translocation sites for <em>M. clivicola</em>, identified key habitat and water quality variables important for juvenile, adult and total fish abundance. Results showed that pH was the most important variable for juvenile and adult abundance, followed by benthic and floating algae for juveniles, and bulrush and filamentous waterweed for adult density. Juveniles had the highest abundance in ponds with pH&gt;8, benthic algae cover between 20-50%, and a depth of approximately 0.3 m. Adults had a similar relationship with pH and depth, with densities greatest when bulrush cover was between 20-60% and as filamentous waterweed cover increased.</p>","<p>The main identified threats to the <em>M. clivicola</em> include competition with introduced species, such as <em>Gambusia holbrooki</em> (Barcoo) and <em>Oxyeleotris lineolata / Oreochromis mozambiqua </em>(Burdekin: Pusey <em>et al</em>. 2006); changes in water quality and/or flow by introduced herbivores, particularly feral goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>); loss and degradation of habitat through mining; the collection of the species by aquarists; and a cancerous disease of unknown cause (DEWHA 2008). Additional threats relate to their small, fragmented distributions, especially the Barcoo River population (Unmack 2000). This leaves the species vulnerable to stochastic events, such as changing hydrological and weather patterns (Hammer <em>et al. </em>2009). This has significant implications in relation to climate change, with projections of increased droughts and flooding (Morrongiello <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2011).</p>  <p>Water extraction for mineral exploration may have serious consequences if aquifers become depleted and spring flows cease (Hammer <em>et al.</em> 2009). Already, diminished flows and lower water levels have been recorded for springs in the area, which have been attributed to prolonged drought and a deflated water table (Morrongiello <em>et al.</em> 2011). Both populations in the Northern Flinders Ranges are dependent on spring flows to maintain permanent surface water habitats when ephemeral creeks are not flowing from localized rainfall events (McNeil<em> et al. </em>2011).</p><p>The proposed Adani mine plans to extract large amount of water that could affect the Doongmabulla Springs Complex.<br/></p>  <p>During the 2010 population assessment of Flinders Ranges Mogurnda, surveys confirmed the ongoing presence of skin growths and discolouration in about 20% of adult fish from the two streams where it appears to only occur (McNeil <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2011). These symptoms were initially recognised in fish from Weetootla Spring during the 1990s and the discoloured blotches were subsequently described as cancerous melanomas that had probably been caused by the hole in the ozone layer. Surveys and concomitant water tests conducted by the Environmental Projection Authority (EPA 2014) in 2012 found that both UV exposure and contaminants were not responsible for this disease. Instead, the EPA (2014) and McNeil <em>et al. </em>(2011) suggest that reduced genetic variation (i.e. in-breeding) around key gene loci may have led to an increased sensitivity to cancer in the population and therefore recommended further genetic testing. With the Nepouie population stocked from a very small number of seed fish, further genetic limitation and susceptibility may be increased in this population (McNeil <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>","<p>The species persists as restricted, and moderate to small, subpopulations across its broad range.&#160;In 2010, McNeil<em> et al.</em> (2011) conducted targeted fish sampling in the Northern Flinders Ranges to provide an updated status of populations and to identify current and future threats to the species. Sampling involved visits to three previously recorded sites (Nepouie Spring, Weetootla Spring and a man-made stone tank at Balcanoona Ranger Station) plus another 14 sites that were potentially supporting populations. Only two populations were found to exist in the Northern Flinders Ranges (i.e. Balcanoona and Weetootla subpopulations), with the translocated population at Balcanoona Ranger Station no longer existing.&#160;The extent of the Northern Flinders Ranges populations consisted of the source/native population over a 4 km stretch of intermittent pools at Weetootla spring, and one translocated population over a 750 m stretch of intermittent pools at Nepouie Spring. Populations were considered stable, with total population estimate close to previous estimates of ~ 4,000 individuals, made in assessments a decade earlier. The Weetootla subpopulation of Flinders Ranges Gudgeon was estimated at between 1,300-3,300 individuals (McNeil<em> et al.</em> 2011), while the established translocated Nepouie Spring subpopulation was believed to be between 74-240 individuals (McKay 1985). During the 2010 survey, a wide range of size classes were detected indicating recent recruitment and spawning success (McNeil<em> et al. </em>2011). The status of Queensland subpopulations is not monitored.</p><p>The Balcanoona Creek subpopulation is thought to contract considerably in dry periods, possibly as low as 150 individuals in a few pools associated with two small springs (McKay 1985).<br/></p>",Stable,"<p><em>Mogurnda clivicola </em>was historically broadly distributed, in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia and the Cooper, Bulloo and Burdekin catchments, Queensland (Allen 1989, Wager and Jackson 1993, McNeil <em>et al</em>. 2011, Briggs <em>et al.</em> 2018). It has been extirpated from all but one site in the Cooper catchment and has not been recorded other than one 1955 record in the Bulloo Catchment.<br/></p><p>Extant populations are found in the Flinders Ranges where it occurs along a few kilometres of connected habitat in the Balcanoona and Weetootla creeks in the Gammon Ranges National Park with a translocated population established in Nepouie Creek (Nepouie Springs). In Queensland, it occurs in one small isolated spring (near Yaraka). The species also occurs in the Beylando River (Burdekin catchment: P. Unmack pers. comm.), but only based on a few geographically distant records, though it is probably present in additional localities as the region is poorly sampled.</p>","<em>Mogurnda</em> species, including the <em>M. clivicola</em>, are kept as aquarium fish and are said to easily breed in captivity throughout the year if given suitable conditions (DEWHA 2008). However, these fishes have rarely been collected by native fish enthusiasts, due to the inaccessibility of collection sites and their aggressive behaviour.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p><em>Mogurnda clivicola</em> has been identified by the South Australian Arid Lands Natural Resource Management (SAAL NRM) Board as a priority species (Brandle 2001, DEWHA 2008). The Board has subsequently expressed interest (and received funding) in translocating populations to ensure the continued survival of the species (M. Brandle pers. comm. 2016). However, the ecology and distribution of <em>M. clivicola</em> is poorly understood, with limited research conducted on the species. The most comprehensive study to date by McNeil <em>et al. </em>(2011) suggests translocation to ensure species persistence; however the authors emphasised that more research is needed regarding ecology, impacts and distribution before further action is taken (and noting new information is available on the broader distribution of the species outside South Australia).</p><p>An investigation was carried out by Roush (2016) into the suitability of potential translocation sites for <em>M. clivicola</em>. Data collected were combined with broader landscape information to assess the suitability of four potential translocation sites: Granite Creek at Mawsons Plateau (Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary), Moro Gorge (Nantawarrina Indigenous Protected Area), Wilkawillina Gorge (Flinders Ranges NP) and Spring Creek (Flinders Ranges NP), for populations of <em>M. clivicola</em>. Based on initial investigations, Roush (2016) proposed that while the species<em> </em>could potentially survive at all sites, Granite Creek and Moro Gorge appear to be most suitable for viable long-term populations. However, further monitoring and assessment of these sites was recommended to assess specific site suitability.</p><p>In the ‘Approved conservation advice for <em>Mogurnda clivicola </em>(Flinders Ranges Gudgeon)’ (DEWHA 2008), research priorities to inform future regional and local priority actions included:</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Design and implement a monitoring program,</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Investigate potential impacts of climate change on river ecosystems in the region,</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Undertake studies into the cancer, particularly its cause and effects on the <em>M. clivicola</em>, and</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Maintain an <em>ex-situ </em>population (to quarantine against any possible rapid loss of wild populations), maintain disease-free stock, and (where appropriate) bolster or extend wild populations).</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Undertake relevant genetic investigations.</p><p>In supporting the recovery of <em>M. clivicola</em>, the following <u>regional</u> priority recovery and threat abatement actions were recommended (DEWHA 2008):</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Identify populations of high conservation priority.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ensure chemicals or other mechanisms used to eradicate weeds do not have a significant adverse impact on <em>M. clivicola</em>.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ensure infrastructure or development activities do not adversely impact on areas where the Flinders Ranges Gudgeon occurs.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Manage any changes to hydrology that may result in changes to the water levels in aquatic habitats and associated table levels, increased run-off, sedimentation or pollution.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Investigate formal conservation arrangements such as the use of covenants, conservation agreements or inclusion in reserve tenure.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Implement the appropriate management recommendations in the <em>Threat Abatement Plan for Competition and Land Degradation by Feral Goats </em>(EA, 1999) to control goats in the local region.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Raise awareness of the <em>M. clivicola</em>, within the local community, including the need to protect the species from habitat destruction and commercial collection.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Implement strategies for managing the commercial collection of <em>M. clivicola</em>.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Establish artificial refugia (sourced during times of greater abundance) to allow restocking if local populations decline or become extinct.</p><p>In supporting the recovery of the <em>M. clivicola</em>, the following <u>local</u> priority recovery and threat abatement actions were recommended (DEWHA 2008):</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Monitor known populations to identify key threats.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Monitor the progress of recovery, including the effectiveness of management actions and the need to adapt them if necessary.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Control access routes to suitably constrain public access to known sites.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Undertake survey work in suitable habitat and potential habitat to locate any additional populations.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Minimise adverse impacts from altered riparian land use at known sites.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Manage any disruptions to water flows.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Monitor areas of known and potential habitat for Gambusia.</p><p>•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Manage known sites in reserve areas and private property to control introduced pests such as goats and Gambusia.</p><p>If genetic homogeneity is contributing to increased melanoma, McNeil <em>et al.</em> (2011) also suggested that research into the role of particular genes in increasing susceptibility may reveal important knowledge that can help us understand and treat the disease in both fish and possibility humans.

However, they are also encountered frequently several metres away from water. They climb fallen dead tree trunks or boulders jutting out from water for basking during the day. They also emerge from water to forage and to migrate to other water sources. During the height of the dry season they aestivate in the mud in tanks or sand in dried streams.<br/><br/>These soft-shell terrapins inhabit stagnant and slow flowing freshwater habitats, and in brackish waters as well as lagoons, ox-bow lakes, streams, rice fields with water, and canals in cities. They are also kept by some inside wells and temple ponds. The occurrence of <em>Lissemys ceylonensis</em> is sympatric with <em>Melanochelys trijuga thermalis</em> and <em>M. t. parkeri</em>.<br/><br/>This species scavenges on animal corpses far from water bodies, and also preys on frogs, tadpoles, fish, crustaceans, snails, earthworms, insects, carrion and water plants. Deraniyagala (1939) reported on this aspect in detail, including the aggressive nature and habit of delivering a painful bite. However, this varying temperate may be an individual habit. Clutches of 2–5 eggs are observed during the months of January, February and March mainly buried on bunds in a pit about 5–6 cm deep. The eggs are white, nearly spherical, brittle hard-shelled. Clutches usually comprise 2–8 eggs, each measuring 25.0–33.0 mm. A generation length of 20 years is estimated.","The main threat faced by <em>Lissemys ceylonensis</em> is that it is widely harvested in large numbers for food. The flesh is a folk remedy for anaemia (Deraniyagala 1939). It is widely consumed in Sri Lanka despite it being illegal since pre-Christian times (Chandraratne 1997). Eggs and hatchlings are also eaten by the mongoose and Common Water Monitor (<em>Varanus salvator</em>) which frequents egg laying sites. Additionally, long term effects of the wide use of chemical fertiliser, insecticides and herbicides that drain into and contaminate the water bodies where the species inhabit should be investigated, as there is an alarming increase in the rate of kidney diseases among farmers in the dry zone due to the wide use of agricultural chemicals. An increase in the fresh water fishery industry has also meant that <em>L. ceylonensis</em> is at a greater threat of becoming entangled in fishing nets and caught as bycatch.&#160; Gramentz (2009) reported deformities in two soft-shell terrapins from Miriswatta. One of the males had a small hump on the left side of the carapace near the proximal end of the 3rd pleural, the other had a slightly smaller hump around the 4th neural.&#160;During recent surveys, individuals of this species were observed entangled and drowned in fishing nets.&#160;Some fishermen also catch the terrapin using bait and fishing rod (A. de Silva pers. comm. 2019).","<em>Lissemys ceylonensis</em> is found in most of the places inhabited by <em>Melanochelys trijuga thermalis</em>.

While there are only six documented spawning sites for this species, and it relies on estuarine habitats for certain of its life history phases, it may be impacted by habitat degradation in parts of its range. Other major threats to this species are unknown. Therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern.","<em>Argyrosomus&#160;regius </em>is a demersal, oceanodromous species that occurs in inshore and shelf waters, close to the bottom as well as in surface and mid-waters, pursuing shoals of clupeids and mugilids. Adults congregate inshore to spawn during spring and summer. Juveniles and subadults enter estuaries and coastal lagoons, and recruitment success may be dependent on these habitats (Chao and Trewavas 1990). Both adults and juveniles are migratory, moving along shore or offshore-onshore in response to temperature change (Penrith 1978). This species feeds on fishes and swimming crustaceans and mostly occurs over sand, close to rocks, at one to 200 m depth max, but is commonly found at 15-100 m (Louisy 2002). This species can live to at least 40 years of age and has a late age at first reproduction at 7 years (Haffray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). There are only six documented spawning areas reported this species: the Nile delta (Egypt), Levrier Bay (Mauritania), Gironde estuary (France), the Tagus estuary (Portugal), Guadalquivir estuary (Spain), and the Aegean Sea (Turkey) (Tixerant 1974, Costa 1986, Lagardere and Mariani 2006, Haffray <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The maximum recorded length for this species is 200 cm but it is common to 50 cm (Chao 2016). Growth is mainly achieved during summer with feeding activity being substantially reduced when sea temperatures drop below 13-15 ºC.&#160;During its reproductive migration, adults approach the coast in mid-April. They move into estuaries at the end of May in order to spawn (anadromous migration). During the spawning season (June to mid-July), males produce aggregation and courtship sounds referred to as ""grunts"" (Lagardere and Mariani 2006). A 120 cm female produces about 800,000 eggs and spawning occurs at water temperatures of 17-22 ºC. Fertilized eggs measure 990 µm in diameter (Castaldo 2012).","This is a commercial and recreational species, mainly caught by trawls, long lines and hand lines.  Species utilization can also include recreational and educational use for public aquarium exhibits and it is caught alive for this purpose. Given the restricted and limited number of reported spawning areas, habitat destruction of estuarine environments is a particular threat because juveniles depend on these as nursery grounds.&#160;Threats include pollution of rivers where juveniles occur, transfer of disease from cultivated animals to wild populations, and overfishing.","The species is rare to not uncommon throughout most of its range in the Mediterranean. Capture fishery data for the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean/Black seas show stable but fluctuating landings (FAO 2018) between 3,879 t in 2002 to 6,370 t in 2008, and 5,167 t in 2016 with a peak of 8,668 t in 2014, although landings in eastern Turkey have declined along with its catch size distribution. There are, however, limited population data for its distribution range outside of the Mediterranean Sea.&#160;There has been a steady increase in aquaculture production in Mediterranean basin countries (primarily Spain, Italy, Egypt, France, and Portugal), from 296 t reported in 2002 to 13,742 t in 2011 (FAO 2018).<br/><br/>There are two distinct genetic groups for this species, with one occurring in the Atlantic and the other in the Mediterranean (Haffray <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The population of this species in the Mediterranean Sea is suspected to have decreased (Quéro and Vayne 1987). It was frequently caught in recent decades but is since&#160;considered to be locally extinct, or possibly just very rare, in parts of its range in the western Mediterranean (Mayol <em>et al. </em>2000, del Mar Gil <em>et al</em>. 2017).",Unknown,"<em>Argyrosomus regius</em> is found in the Eastern Atlantic, from the western Baltic Sea and Norway to the North Sea, south to Gibraltar and Congo, including the Mediterranean (less common around Italy and Greece) and the western Black seas.  Also, in recent years this species has migrated to the northern Red Sea via the Suez Canal (Golani and Fricke 2018). This species is cultivated in both land and seacages, mostly in France and Italy (FAO 2006). This species occurs at depths from 15 to 200 m depth with an unconfirmed record to 400 m depth (Chao 2016).","The species is a popular food fish and is targeted by both commercial and recreational fisheries. It is often found in public aquariums in Europe and elsewhere. In commercial fisheries, the species is mainly caught by trawls, long lines, and hand lines.<br/><br/>This species is cultivated in both land and sea cages, mostly in France and Italy (Cognetti <em>et al. </em>2006, Aguado-Gimenez<em> et al. </em>2007) and production from this source is expanding. Aquaculture production of the species has increased rapidly in recent decades, reaching over 14,000 tons in 2010 (FAO 2012); based on its aquaculture production, it has the potential to become a mass market species (Monfort 2010).&#160;FAO (2011) reported that the worldwide landings of the species amounted to 20,310 tonnes in 2011, and the landings reported from 2000 to 2009 were between 2,386-9,095 with a steadily increasing trend.",Marine,"The range for this species overlaps with a number of marine protected areas, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea.

They use intertidal and beach habitats to avoid excessive heat at colonies (Pozzi <em>et al. </em>2013). At sea, they typically remain over the continental shelf in Argentina (Stokes <em>et al. </em>1998, Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2002, Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Boersma and Rebstock 2009, Raya Rey <em>et al.</em> 2010, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Yorio <em>et al</em>. 2010, Raya Rey <em>et al.</em> 2012, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2012, Gómez-Laich <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rosciano <em>et al.</em> 2016), but may forage in deep waters off the (very narrow) shelf in Chile (Raya Rey <em>et al</em>. 2013, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Pütz <em>et al</em>. 2016) <em></em>and in the Falkland <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Islands (Malvinas) (Pütz <em>et al.</em> 2002<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">). Individuals may also forage on the continental slope; males tend to be more offshore-foragers compared to females. They dive up to almost 100 m, but more often to a few dozen metres (Walker and Boersma 2003, Raya Rey<em> et al</em>. 2012, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gómez-Laich <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rosciano <em>et al</em>. 2016). They may be seen foraging in shallow water close to the shore, but more often forage out of sight of land. Penguins tracked by satellite, GPS and geolocation tags during incubation typically foraged more than 100 km, and sometimes as much as 600 km from various colonies in Argentina (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boersma and Rebstock 2009, Boersma<em> et al. </em>2009, 2013, 2015). Even when provisioning chicks, adults forage hundreds of kilometers from the colony (Boersma and Rebstock 2009, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Boersma <em>et al. </em>2009), although at many colonies they travel up to a few dozen km (Raya Rey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Yorio <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2012, Gómez-Laich <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rosciano <em>et al</em>. 2016).

In the 1980s and early 1990s, oil pollution was estimated to kill more than 20,000 adults and 22,000 juveniles every year on the Argentinian coast (Gandini <em>et al.</em> 1994, Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al.</em> 2006, Boersma 2008), which is also the wintering ground for the population from the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (Pütz <em>et al.</em> 2000). This threat is now much reduced at least in Chubut Province, which now experiences mortality of less than 100 individuals every year (Boersma 2008, P. D. Boersma and E. Frere <em>pers. comm.</em> 2016). Chronic oil pollution and mortality still occurs off Brazil, Uruguay, northern Argentina and Chile (Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2008, Matus and Blank 2008). Future petroleum extraction is under consideration offshore of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Patagonia and Uruguay, which would likely increase mortality. Southern colonies are subject to disproportionately high mercury levels for their trophic level (Brasso <em>et al.</em> 2015). Birds from the northern colony in Punta Tombo colony have been found to have much lower mercury levels (Frias <em>et al.</em> 2012). Detrimental effects were not evident in that study, but mercury exposure could be a long-term or synergetic threat.<br/><br/>This species interacts with fisheries along the coast of South America, through bycatch mortality from gillnets, trawls and purse-seines (Gandini <em>et al.</em> 1999, Tamini <em>et al.</em> 2002, González-Zevallos and Yorio 2006, Schlatter <em>et al.</em> 2009, Yorio <em>et al.</em> 2010, Cardoso <em>et al.</em> 2011, González-Zevallos <em>et al.</em> 2011, Marinao and Yorio 2011, Seco Pon <em>et al.</em> 2013, Marinao <em>et al.</em> 2014, Suazo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Trathan <em>et al</em>. 2014, Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2015, Suazo <em>et al. </em>2016, L.

Population trends in response to these threats have not been quantified.&#160;Fisheries may also reduce prey for penguins; the hake fishery in Argentina for example collapsed due to overfishing during the 1990s (Alemany <em>et al.</em> 2013). A potential expansion of the Argentinian anchovy fishery might impact breeding penguins (Skewgar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fisheries in northern Argentine Patagonia may be having an additional effect, as bycatch includes anchovy and juvenile hake, which are an important part of the species's diet (Frere <em>et al.</em> 1996, Gandini <em>et al.</em> 1999, Scolaro <em>et al.</em> 1999, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yorio <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further, fisheries for anchovy and sprat, both considered “underexploited” stocks, may be developed in Argentina and Brazil (Sanchez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Skewgar <em>et al.</em> 2007, Carvalho and Castello 2013).</p><p>Climate change has been reported to have an impact, as precipitation has increased over the last 30 years and young chicks that get wet often die from hypothermia (Boersma and Rebstock 2014). Precipitation causes nest burrows to collapse (Boersma 2009, Boersma and Rebstock 2014). Climate models show precipitation will increase over much of the species’s range, lowering reproductive output of many colonies (Boersma and Rebstock 2014). Decreasing breeding synchrony interacted with climate change to increase the part of the season when chicks are vulnerable to wetting (Boersma and Rebstock 2014). High temperatures in the breeding colonies can kill adults and chicks (Boersma and Rebstock 2014, P. D. Boersma unpublished data). Changing patterns of precipitation and atmospheric and oceanic circulation are likely to affect winter conditions in the Atlantic, indirectly affecting breeding, as the extent of the Rio de la Plata plume affects females' colony arrival timing and body condition (Rebstock and Boersma 2018). Indirect effects of climate change through changes in prey populations or availability are completely unknown. <br/></p><p>In some areas of Chile, eggs and adults are collected for human consumption and adults are taken for bait (Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2013, Suazo <em>et al.</em> 2013, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Boersma <em>et al.</em>   2015). Egg-collection occurred also in the Falklands Islands (Malvinas). The introduction of feral dogs and other invasive species in  the breeding colonies have resulted in local extirpations (Suazo <em>et al.</em>  2013), but population level declines have not been quantified. Tourism may disturb individuals at breeding colonies when not well managed (Boersma 2008). Long-term physiological effects of visits by tourists are not understood (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006). Many of the threats may result in low impacts on the population, but there are many threats that probably have additive effects.<br/></p><p></p>","The world population is estimated at between 1.1 and 1.6 million pairs, which equates to 2.2-3.2 million mature individuals.

Tanker lanes were moved 40 kilometers farther offshore along the coast of Chubut in 1997. This added to improvements at port loading facilities, which greatly reduced the number of oiled penguins in that area (Boersma 2008). The Management Plan for Punta Tombo is in place, but has not yet been effectively implemented by Chubut Province authorities. The Argentine government has created new marine protected parks along the coast, which include some penguin breeding areas and fragments of foraging areas (Patagonia Austral, Isla Pinguino, Makenke and Monte Leon). Specifically, a new UNESCO Biosphere Reserve will help give protection to 20 colonies (Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al. </em>2015). A new Marine Protected Area (MPA) for the large colony has been designated in Argentina (Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2015, Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al. </em>2015). Unfortunately, many of the parks lack effective planning and/or implementation. As MPAs are in general ineffective for the protection of highly mobile species such as penguins (Boersma and Parrish 1999), protection of penguin populations requires new conservation tools (Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2007, Garcia-Borboroglu <em>et al.</em> 2008, Yorio 2009, Stokes <em>et al.</em> 2014, Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2015).

170619657,41291,Oryctolagus cuniculus,Endangered,A2abce,2019,2018-08-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The European Rabbit is a widespread colonizer and is considered a pest  outside its natural range, where eradication of the rabbit is priority  for conservation (Cooke 2014, Cooke, Flux and Bonino 2018). However,  only the natural range of Spain, Portugal, and southern France are  considered in this global assessment. Assessment of the European Rabbit  is filled with contradictions (Lees and Bell 2008, Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em>  2011). The European Rabbit is an important game species in Spain,  Portugal and France, and the agriculture sector considers the species a  pest (not a typical situation for a putatively Threatened species). On  the other hand, it is an important ecosystem engineer (Galvez-Bravo <em>et al.</em> 2009) and a keystone species within its native range (Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em>  2008), serving as the dominant prey item for the highly endangered  Iberian Lynx (<em>Lynx pardinus</em>) and the Spanish Imperial Eagle (<em>Aquila  adalberti</em>) (Ferrer and Negro 2004). However, from 1950 onwards, the  European Rabbit declined dramatically throughout its native range to  densities less than 10% of those found earlier in the 20th century  mainly due to the irruption of viral diseases (Myxomatosis in the  fifties and Rabbit Hemorrhagic disease, RHD, in the nineties), and  habitat loss (Moreno <em>et al.</em> 2007, Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em> 2009a, Villafuerte <em>et al.</em>  2017). Other factors such as human induced mortality or predation may  have played a role in rabbit decline, at least locally. On balance this  situation led more than one decade ago to a classification of the  European Rabbit as Vulnerable in Spain and Near Threatened in Portugal  (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005, Villafuerte and Delibes-Mateos 2008). In  recent years many rabbit populations, particularly in natural habitats,  have continued declining (some have even become extirpated), while  others, mostly in human-modified landscapes, have increased in numbers  leading to an increase in complaints by farmers concerning crop damage  caused by rabbits (Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em> 2014a).<br/><br/>Most  recently, beginning after 2010, a new wave of disease (a new variant of  RHD virus – GI.2/RHDV2/b) has swept through many rabbit populations  causing massive declines. In an area that traditionally held the highest  rabbit densities within Doñana National Park (i.e. Coto del Rey) –  which thus held a core population of Iberian Lynx – there was a decline  of greater than 80% during 2012-2014. In low-density rabbit areas within  the park similar declines have been reported (Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em>  2014b). Rabbit density in the proximity to Yeguas River in Andújar and  Cardeña Natural park in southern Spain, where the largest Iberian Lynx  population lives, the rabbit density declined from more than 3.5  rabbits/ha in 2010 to less than 1 rabbit/ha in 2013 (a decline of  approximately 75%). Also, rabbit abundance decreased by 57% between 2010  and 2014 in 26 localities surveyed in the Córdoba province (southern  Spain), only 11% of these populations experienced a positive trend in  the study period (Guerrero-Casado <em>et al.</em> 2016). The Andalusian  government through censuses that started in 2004, has shown that rabbit  density has decreased on average by more than 50% in 2016, despite the  increase in abundance detected in some agricultural areas, where rabbits  have to be controlled to avoid crop damage (www.juntadeandalucia.es).  Hunters have similarly noted the decreased abundance of rabbits based on  declines of 70-80% in the hunter bags in some estates compared with  recent years (Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em> 2014b). In summary, the  recent overall estimated 60-70% decline in populations of European  Rabbits over the past decade has been followed by decreases of 65.7% in  Iberian Lynx and 45.5% in Spanish Imperial Eagle fecundities (Monterroso  <em>et al.</em> 2016). These new data lead to a re-evaluation of the  previous assessment of the European Rabbit as NT, to EN – Endangered A2abce reflecting that populations have experienced or are  experiencing declines mainly due to the recent impact of GI.2/RHDV2/b.  The A3 criteria has not been applied because European Rabbits have been  known to develop immunity to epizootics of prior viral diseases, it is  hoped that a similar recovery will occur following this epizootic.","The European Rabbit prefers a mixed habitat of Mediterranean oak savanna  or scrub-forest, or areas with around 40% cover for shelter from  predators and open areas that support their diet of grasses and cereals  (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995, Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004).  Nevertheless, in the Iberian Peninsula, rabbits are increasingly found  at high densities in intensively-managed farmland areas (Barrio <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). The European Rabbit builds warrens in soft soil (Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2004), but finds shelter in scrub in rocky areas, though predation risk  is higher in above ground dwellings (Villafuerte and Moreno 1997). The  natural range of the European Rabbit on the Iberian Peninsula is warm  and dry, rarely occurring above 1,500 m (Fa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999). The rabbits are territorial and tend to live and forage in colony groups of up to 20 adults (Mitchell-Jones <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999), and are crepuscular (Lombardi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>The  European Rabbit can breed throughout the year (uncommon in lagomorphs),  though this is limited by climate and resource availability (Bell and  Webb 1991, Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997). They raise altricial  young between three and six at a time, which leave the warren in under a  month (Gibb 1990). Females reach sexual maturity on average in 3.5  months, males in 4 months, and can live up to 9 years (Macdonald and  Barrett 2001), though many succumb to predation and other perils much  earlier. Up to 75% of young rabbits are killed by predators before they  establish a territory (Gibb 1990). Annual mortality is usually higher  than 50% (e.g. Cowan 1983, Webb 1991), but it can be highly variable  among years, seasons, and habitats (Lombardi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Moreno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). The head-body length is 34-50 mm (Macdonald and Barrett 2001).<br/><br/>The European Rabbit is an ecosystem engineer and a keystone species (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Galvez-Bravo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). The diet of the Iberian Lynx consists of 80-100% rabbits (Delibes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000), the Imperial Eagle consumes 40-80% of its diet in rabbits (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2008), and the decline of the European Rabbit has been linked to the  near extinction of these two predators (Ferrer and Negro 2004).<br/><br/>The  European Rabbit is responsible for landscape modelling that supports  vegetation growth typical to Spain and Portugal and creates habitat for  wildlife species (e.g. Galvez-Bravo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Its presence increases species richness (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008) and increases soil fertility (Willott <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).","The greatest force behind the decline of the European Rabbit has been  two diseases that appeared in the 20th century. Myxomatosis is a South  American virus, primarily spread by insect (mosquito and flea) vectors,  that was intentionally introduced by a farmer in the mid-1950s in France  to control the rabbit population (Lavazza and Cooke 2018). An estimated  90% of European Rabbits perished due to myxomatosis after the first  outbreaks in the 1950s (Muñoz 1960), after that, the disease became  endemic to Iberia, where it currently affects most rabbit populations  (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). After symptom onset, death  results in an average of 13 days. Rabbits with the virus are made more  vulnerable to predators (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995) and more susceptible to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD; Barnett <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018). Juveniles are more susceptible to myxomatosis than adults (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Myxomatosis cases peak during early summer to fall (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017).<br/><br/>Rabbit  Haemorrhagic Disease is caused by a lagovirus that appeared in Europe  in the late 1980’s, initially causing the death of 55-75% of rabbits in  the Iberian Peninsula (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). RHD is  primarily spread by direct contact. Death typically results within 24  hours of symptom onset, with a short incubation time of under 48 hours  (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Adult rabbits are more  susceptible to RHD than juveniles (unlike myxomatosis), and RHD is more  prevalent in late winter and spring. Global warming may increase disease  incidence by creating a warmer, drier climate in Spain and Portugal  (Ward 2005).<br/><br/>The new variant of RHD (GI.2/RHD2/b) was originally  described in France in 2010, and since 2011-2012 it has caused  wide-spread mortality among European Rabbits in Spain (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b) and Portugal (Monterroso <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). Declines of from 75% - 80% within two years have decimated many  populations of European Rabbits – particularly in their native habitat,  which coincides with core habitat occupied by Iberian Lynx  (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 20014b, Monterroso <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). The new variant has fully replaced classic RHD strains in Spain and Portugal (Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Lopes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Unlike classic RHD, the new variant kills young rabbits (Dalton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Abrantes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013), compromising population recruitment.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and fragmentation are continuing to cause declines in European Rabbits (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2010), which require pastures-crops and scrub- forest vegetation for  food and shelter, respectively (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995). Modern  intensive agriculture negatively impacts rabbits more than small scale  mixed farming, which may have initially increased suitable habitat  within the rabbit’s natural range (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2010). High intensity livestock production and high ungulate numbers  contributes to habitat degradation and resource competition (Carpio <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2014). Fallow farm land often returns to closed forest rather than open  scrub, which is not a suitable habitat (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995,  Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). Tree plantations planted in Spain  and Portugal have replaced habitat for both rabbits and their predators  and urbanization presents a threat as does increased fire danger in  existing habitat, and climate change (Ward 2005, Tablado and Revilla  2012).<br/><br/>Exploitation of European Rabbis by humans may have become a  threat in some places, especially in the case of populations that are  already declining due to other causes, so rabbits cannot sustain hunting  and control measures as well as in the past. As an example, in Aragón  (northeastern Spain) the strongest negative rabbit population trends  were found in areas with high hunting pressure (Williams <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Farmers and hunters control rabbit populations in farmland areas directly by shooting and trapping (Ríos-Saldaña <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2010). Farming indirectly causes decline through habitat conversion and  excessive pesticide and fertilizer use. Over 70% of Spain is designated  as hunting area, and in recent years some hunters have reported a 70% -  80% decline in hunting success due to lower rabbit populations  resulting from the new variant of RHDv (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b).<br/><br/>Future  threats to the European Rabbit may include genetically modified  versions of the rabbit viruses being developed in Australia to reduce  rabbit numbers where the species is a major pest. Unlicensed release of  modified viruses to the native range could devastate the remaining  populations (Angulo 2001). Finally. the mixture of both subspecies due  the restocking of rabbits for hunting or predator conservation purposes,  may also become a threat by losing the natural genetic diversity  compromising the survival and reproduction in the wild (Piorno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).","The European Rabbit decline has escalated in recent years. As of 2005,  rabbit populations in the Iberian Peninsula had declined to as little as  5-10% of the number from 1950, based on the decrease in Doñana National  Park, a protected area (Delibes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Moreno <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2007). Density of rabbits has been recorded at a maximum of 40 per  hectare in prime habitat, though the abundance has declined  significantly since the arrival of new threats, primarily the spread of  viral diseases (myxomatosis and RHD), in the mid-20th century  (Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009a, Villafuerte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2017). In Portugal, a population reduction of 24% was recorded between  1995 and 2002 (Alves and Ferreira 2002), but this decline was much more  pronounced previously as a consequence of myxomatosis and RHD outbreaks  in the 1950s and late 1980s, respectively. Decline has been uneven  across the range, due to varying degrees of threat (Ward 2005,  Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009a).<br/><br/>Most recently,  beginning in 2011-2012, a new wave of disease (a new variant of Rabbit  Hemorrhagic Disease virus – GI.2/RHDV2/b) has swept through many rabbit  populations causing massive declines. This variant has completely  replaced the traditional RHDv strain across Iberia (Calvete <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Lopes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2015), and its drastic effects are evident. In an area that  traditionally held the highest rabbit densities within Doñana National  Park (i.e. Coto del Rey) – which thus held a core population of Iberian  Lynx – there was a decline of greater than 80% during 2012-2014. In  low-density rabbit areas within the park similar declines have been  reported (Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). Rabbit  density in the proximity to Yeguas River in Andújar and Cardeña National  parks in southern Spain, where the largest Iberian Lynx population  lives, the rabbit density declined from more than 3.5 rabbits/ha in 2010  to less than 1 rabbit/ha in 2013 (a decline of approximately 75%).  Hunters have similarly noted the decreased abundance of rabbits based on  declines of 70-80% in the hunter bags in some estates compared with  recent years (Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). Also,  rabbit abundance decreased by 57% between 2010 and 2014 in 26 localities  surveyed in the Córdoba province (southern Spain), only 11% of these  populations experienced a positive trend during the study period  (Guerrero-Casado <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016). The recent overall  estimated 60-70% decline in populations of European Rabbits has been  followed by decreases of 65.7% in Iberian Lynx and 45.5% in Spanish  Imperial Eagle fecundities (Monterroso <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016).",Decreasing,"Original distribution of the European Rabbit after last ice age included Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) to south-western France and perhaps northern Africa, and the introduction throughout western Europe is thought to have occurred as early as the Roman period (Gibb 1990, Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999). Currently the species ranges through all Western European countries, Ireland and the UK (including islands), Austria, parts of Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, and Mediterranean islands Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Crete, the Balearics (Thompson and King 1994), Croatia, and Slovakia (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999). It was introduced to Australia and New Zealand, where it is now widespread (Thompson and King 1994, Cooke 2014, Cooke <em>et al. </em>2018). European Rabbits have been introduced to South America multiple times since the fifteenth century, but the species maintains a limited range in Argentina and Chile (Delibes and Delibes-Mateos 2015). European Rabbits have similarly been introduced on over 800 islands throughout the world, giving evidence to the plasticity of the species (Flux and Fullagar 1992, Thompson and King 1994). The European Rabbit occurs in a wide variety of habitats, and it is usually found below 1,500 m in elevation in its native range (Fa <em>et al</em>. 1999), although in Tenerife (Canary Islands) it is extremely abundant over 3,000 m (&gt;7.5 rabbits/ha; Cubas <em>et al.</em> 2018).",This is an important game species.&#160;Domesticated forms are important pet animals and are also used in labs for experiments.,Terrestrial,"Important Conservation Actions Needed:<br/><br/>Conservation for the  European Rabbit was delayed for several decades after their decline  became apparent. Efforts began to take shape in the late 1980's due to  previous political isolation of its native range and the lack of  information on the species as a keystone to Iberian ecosystems. The  issue of eradication of European Rabbits from introduced areas (e.g.  Australia, New Zealand, and many islands) may have diminished the  appearance of rabbit decline in its native range. Increased interest in  the specialist predators that depend upon the rabbits and the issue of  the sustainability of hunting populations brought the species into the  public eye, but failed to address some issues of rabbit conservation,  such as its role as an ecosystem modeler and the effects of habitat loss  on populations (Gibb 1990, Ward 2005).<br/><br/>Ward's (2005) report was  key to highlighting the threats associated with the European Rabbit, and  outlined specific goals needed to achieve rabbit recovery:<br/><ul><li>Establish rabbit monitoring programs to accurately describe decline directly.</li></ul><ul><li>Create and implement a management plan for rabbit recovery that  prioritizes critical ranges and populations. Rabbit management plans  started long ago, although they were embedded in the recovery plans of  other species, such as the Imperial Eagle or Iberian Lynx. This  situation continues in many areas, and this goal attempts to ensure  dedicated plans to conserve European Rabbits.</li></ul><ul><li>Programs to limit  the incidence and impact of new and existing diseases may be difficult  in the wild, though some success has been observed in captive  populations. Current vaccines do not confer total immunity to RHD or  myxomatosis, have side effects such as increasing rabbit stress and  vulnerability to predators, and have short-lived effectiveness. In  addition, the need to vaccinate rabbits individually in the field is  unmanageable. Any genetically modified live virus vaccine is  controversial because of the possibility of unpredictable evolution of  the virus, and its potential spread to rabbit populations outside the  natural range of European Rabbits where eradication, not conservation,  is the objective. Increasing habitat quality may indirectly help rabbit  disease resistance given that it is known that high density populations  respond better to disease outbreak (Calvete 2006, Cotilla <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Guerrero-Casado <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). Controlling disease vectors for myxomatosis has not been found  to be effective. Preventing the spread of modified immune-contraceptive  viruses engineered in Australia to control rabbit fertility may become  an issue.</li></ul><ul><li>Reducing hunting impact is not guaranteed to reduce  decline because disease effects often outweigh hunting as a threat, and  because implementation of restrictions would likely not be realistic  given the prevalence of hunting in Iberia, where in many areas their  management strategies are even more effective than the ones carried out  in some protected areas to enhance rabbit populations (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2009b). Revisions to existing hunting seasons have been proposed, but  only some small changes have been tested. Probably, a greater  distinction between hunting regulations should exist between areas where  rabbits are in decline and agricultural areas where the species is  damaging crops, in spite that there are more legal facilities to hunt  rabbits in the latter. A growing recognition among hunters of the issue  of rabbit decline has led to frequent self-restraint (Angulo and  Villafuerte 2003). As a very large demographic, hunters could represent a  powerful force in maintaining sustainable hunting populations.</li></ul><ul><li>Rabbit populations affected by agriculture represent a sensitive issue,  as rabbits are typically seen as a pest and an economic liability for  farmers. Despite pressures from environmental groups, many farmers and  hunters continue to take measures to reduce rabbit numbers even in  agro-forestry areas where the species plays key ecological roles.  Awareness among farmers and hunters of rabbit conservation issues is  generally low. Government policy allows hunters to control rabbits in  farmland areas with permits (Ríos-Saldaña <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010),  and though crop loss due to rabbit damage in some cases is economically  payed through insurance, no requirement of those compensated is made for  conservation.</li></ul><ul><li>Halting and reversing habitat loss and  fragmentation was aided in the past decades by the establishment of  national parks in Spain, but most optimal rabbit habitat is on private  land (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009b). A shift from  high-intensity farming and monoculture forestry back to mixed  agro-forestry and small scale farming would help sustain rabbit  populations (Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2010). Natura 2000 promotion of sustainable development and EU  subsidies supporting environmentally friendly agriculture are promising  but underfunded and too new to demonstrate a significant impact.  Importantly, land abandonment in mountain regions has resulted in the  encroachment of forests and scrubland, which is detrimental for rabbits  (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). In these places, promoting  open areas (i.e. pastures or small scale farming) through scrub  clearance is essential to increase food availability for rabbits (Moreno  and Villafuerte 1995).</li></ul><ul><li>Reintroductions have been a key focus  of conservation efforts, with up to 500,000 released annually in Spain  and France. The efforts so far have not increased rabbit populations in  most cases, due to the unappropriated selection of the animals to be  released and increased mortality from predation and inadvertent spread  of disease, which may actually have a net negative impact. The flaws in  reintroduction practices do not completely negate the importance of the  efforts, which have been shown to help sustain predators and hunting  populations at least locally (e.g. Rouco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Guerrero-Casado <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2013). The success of reintroductions may be increased by fencing from  predators and competitors and preventing short-term dispersal in  addition to providing feeding resources (Rouco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).</li></ul><ul><li>Though rabbit predators have not directly caused rabbit decline,  factors that have caused initial decline (e.g. disease, habitat loss)  may be exacerbated by some opportunistic predators (Fernández de Simón <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2015). Game keeping efforts to increase rabbit populations often focus  on predator reduction, and sometimes predators of conservation concern  are affected because non-selective practices are used (e.g.  cage-trapping or poisoning). Efforts could be more productively focused  on increasing habitat protection (e.g. building artificial rabbit  warrens), reduction of rabbit mortality by humans (hunting,  inappropriate management practices) and reducing disease impacts.</li></ul><br/>The  importance of the European Rabbit within its natural range requires  that it be considered for listing in spite of its global abundance. In  its original range it is a keystone to the Mediterranean ecosystem, as  prey for specialist predators (Virgos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008) and as a landscape modeler (Galvez-Bravo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). It is an important game species in Spain and Portugal (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014a).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In captivity, the larvae took six months and longer to metamorphose (Michaels <em>et al</em>.&#160;2015).","One potential threat to this species would appear to be the risk of introduction of fish into Lake Oku, which could wipe out this restricted-range species. Such a scenario is highly plausible given the high protein demands of surrounding communities. However there have been no official fish introductions into the lake as of yet, and fish introduction continues to be blocked by the local forestry and wildlife office (which manages the protected area encompassing the lake) and opposed by traditional authorities (Fon and elders) and local environmentalists who also encourage the abstinence of fish introduction (T. Doherty-Bone pers. comm. November 2016).

This occurs through livestock grazing and forest loss due to wood cutting and infrastructure developments. These are likely to be exacerbated by increases in visitors to the lake as a result of these developments, and if unregulated could induce increased demands for fuel wood and garbage accumulation (T. Doherty-Bone pers. comm. February 2017). There have also been cases when visitors to the lake have washed clothes using chemical detergents.

It may have increased since 2000, or previous estimates may have been too low. The population is currently believed to be stable, though there are plausible future threats from introduced mammals, the potential introduction of disease or natural disasters, as Narcondam Hornbill remains restricted to one tiny island. As such it is assessed as Vulnerable under Criterion D1 + 2.&#160;<p></p>","It is resident in fairly open mixed forest, which covers most of the island, from sea-level to the peak at c. 700 m asl, although the majority of nests are below 200 m asl (Vijayan 2009). <br/><br/>This hornbill species is found in the island’s deciduous-dominated forest in the northern and north-eastern portion with the rest of the island having evergreen forest with cloud forest on the top. Nests up to 450 m asl have been found (Manchi 2017). It uses mature, undisturbed forests with large trees for nesting and roosting. The species nests in holes on the trunk or broken branches of large trees and the female is sealed into a nest-cavity for the duration of egg-laying and chick-rearing (the breeding period spanning at least from February until April). At this time, the female sheds her flight feathers and is incapable of flight. Each pair generally raise two young. Breeding birds are over four years old and constitute c. 46-53% of the population (Vijayan 2009). Twenty-one nests of the species that were observed showed 93% success (Manchi 2017).<br/><br/>Hussain (1984) noted seeds of the following food tree species below nests: <em>Anamirta cocculus</em>,<em> Capparis sepiaria</em>,<em> C. tenera </em>var.<em> latifolia</em>,<em> Garuga pinnata</em>,<em> Amoora rohituka</em>,<em> Terminalia catappa </em>and <em>Ixora brunniscens.</em> The birds are also known to consume invertebrates and occasionally small reptiles (Vijayan 2009).&#160;Manchi (2017) recorded 22 species of fruits during the breeding season including species like <em>Canarium euphyllum</em> and <em>Aglaia andamanica</em>. In a recent 3-month study, 23 species of food plants were documented. Some of the species in their diet from December to February included <em>Ficus rumphii</em>, <em>Ficus glabberima</em>, <em>Endocomia</em> sp., <em>Chionanthus</em> sp. and <em>Aidea densiflorum</em> (Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>Nests were documented in at least 12 different species including <em>Tetrameles nudiflora</em>, <em>Zanthoxylum </em>sp<em>.</em>, <em>Aglaia</em> sp., <em>Neonauclea</em> sp., and <em>Ficus nervosa</em> among others (Rohit Naniwadekar&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020)<br/><p></p>","A small police outpost was established on the island in 1969. Approximately 20 hectares of forest had been lost since then to the creation of the post and plantations of coconut, areca, banana and vegetable plots (Raman <em>et al.</em> 2013), however current estimates suggest that only 5-7 ha is actively cultivated with the rest lying fallow/unused (Rohit Naniwadekar&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020). At least 10 living trees used to be cut each year for fuel wood for the camp and further wood was also cut periodically for maintenance purposes, and live chickens were also brought to the island by police stationed on the island (Raman <em>et al. </em>2013). Currently, only dry, dead wood is occasionally collected (Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt.</em> 2020). A proposal to install a radar station on the island was rejected after clear demonstration of the likely detrimental impact on the population of the species (Ministry of Environment and Forests 2012, Raman<em> et al.</em> 2013); it was approved again (Mudappa and&#160;Raman&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020), but subsequently the plan was modified and no radar installation has been built on the island (Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>There is the potential for avian disease to affect the population via further introductions of domestic animals, and there is also the potential impact of the accidental introduction of non-native predators.&#160;<br/><br/>Previously up to 400 feral goats <em>Capra hircus</em> were living on the island and limiting natural forest regeneration, but all have now been removed (Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt. </em>2020). A sizeable population of feral cats <em>Felis catus&#160;</em>used to occur on the island, however now there are only 2 males (Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt.</em> 2020). Rats (<em>Rattus sp</em>.) are abundant on the island. They can be seen even in the higher elevations, in the daytime in the forest floor.&#160; They have been documented to feed on seeds of several hornbill food plant species such as <em>Caryota mitis</em>, <em>Endocomia</em>, <em>Canarium</em>, <em>Sideroxylon</em>, among others. A study has been initiated in 2019 to assess the impacts of rodent seed predation on key hornbill food plants (Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>Hunting for food was estimated to be causing an annual loss of 25-40 birds at the start of the 2000s (Islam and Rahmani 2010), but an awareness campaign has reduced this level (Raman <em>et al</em>. 2013) and it is not believed to be a significant threat at present.&#160;<br/><br/>Most threats like the presence of the introduced goats, forest clearing, hunting of the species mentioned in past studies, do not exist anymore (Manchi 2017). However, Narcondam Hornbill has a small population and a tiny range, making it susceptible to stochastic events that could rapidly drive the population to a highly threatened state, in particular disease and natural disasters: while the 2004 tsunami did not impact the species, the impact of a typhoon may be devastating.<br/><p></p>","The population is estimated to number between 750-1,400 individuals (R. Naniwadekar unpublished data&#160;<em>in litt. </em>to the IUCN SSC Hornbill Specialist Group 2020). This is based on the 95% confidence interval from an extrapolation of the density estimates derived during fieldwork between December 2019 and February 2020.&#160;To estimate the number of mature individuals, two pieces of additional information are used. A previous study investigating the species estimated that the breeding population was 46-53% of the total number of individuals (Vijayan and Sankaran 2000). Second, a male-biased sex-ratio (56/44) was recorded by Manchi (2017), which would slightly reduce the number of mature individuals to consider in the assessment. Using the most recent estimate, the population size is between 345 – 742 mature individuals when applying the proportion of the breeding population from Vijayan and&#160;Sankaran 2000, but further reduced if we account for the skewed sex ratio to 304-653 mature individuals, rounded to 300-650 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The earliest known estimate of Narcondam Hornbill population was by Osmaston (1905) who collected ten hornbill specimens and gave a ‘liberal estimate’ of not more than 200 on the island. Based on an approximately month-long survey in March-April 1972, Hussain (1984, 1993) suggested a higher ‘liberal estimate’ of around 400 birds on the island. The first transect-based estimate, based on a 3-month survey in 1998, reported around 330 – 360 birds on Narcondam (Vijayan and Sankaran 2000). Yahya and Zarri (2002) made a brief survey in March 2000 using two line transect methods and estimated the hornbill density at 72/km² and 83/km², suggesting a total population of 432 or 498 birds over 6 km² of habitat estimated to be available. In 2003, Vivek and Vijayan (2003) found the overall density of the species was estimated at around 54 individuals per km² (Vivek and Vijayan 2003). The population was estimated to number 320-340 individuals, based on an effective area of habitat of 6 km<sup>2</sup>.&#160;<br/><br/>The results of these studies were interpreted by Kinnaird and O'Brien (2007) to equate to fewer than 250 mature individuals, hence the population was placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals. However, since 2010 all studies indicate that the numbers are higher. In a 4-day survey in April 2010, the density of Narcondam Hornbills estimated using variable-width line transect surveys on trails in lowland forest was found to be around 167 birds/km² (95% confidence interval of 63.3–271 individuals/km²) (Raman <em>et al.</em> 2013). Raman <em>et al. </em>2013 emphasised that the density should not be extrapolated to the island as the trails surveyed were non-randomly placed. Manchi (2017) reported a density of 190 ± 81 birds/km<sup>2</sup> based on transect surveys with an estimated population of 1295 birds (extrapolated for the whole island). However, most of the population is distributed below 500 m above msl, hence the total population was likely an overestimate.",Stable,"This species is endemic to the tiny (6.82 km<sup>2</sup>) island of Narcondam, east of the Andaman Islands, <strong>India</strong>.  The population has been estimated a number of times in the last few  decades and appears to be roughly stable, however estimates since the removal of goats, almost all cats and since hunting ceased have been consistently higher, with the most recent population estimate from 2019-2020 now 750-1,400 individuals, and densities of 150 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (R. Naniwadekar unpublished data&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>to the IUCN SSC Hornbill Specialist Group 2020).<br/>Previous population estimates (before 2005) had been lower. In 1998 the population was  estimated at 295-320 birds and considered stable with an estimated 68-85  breeding pairs, while during fieldwork in 2000 the population was  estimated to be 432 individuals (Yahya and Zarri 2002). In 2003, Vivek and Vijayan (2003) reported 320-340 individuals. The  overall density of the species was estimated at between 54 and 71  individuals per km<sup>2</sup> (Vivek and Vijayan 2003).<p></p>","Previously it was estimated that hunting for food was estimated to be causing an annual loss of 25-40 birds at the start of the 2000s (Islam and&#160;Rahmani 2010), but an awareness campaign has reduced this level (Raman <em>et al. </em>2013) and now it is believed that very few, if any are taken at all (Manchi 2017).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>CITES Appendix II. It is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act and Narcondam Island is a wildlife sanctuary. Goats have been removed successfully (Manchi 2017, Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt. </em>2020). Strict instructions not to hunt the species have been issued to the personnel on the island. In 1992, the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) began preliminary surveys of the avifauna on the Andaman Islands, with an emphasis on several target species, including Narcondam Hornbill. Gas cylinders and stoves are used by the police personnel to reduce dependence on fuel wood (Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt.</em> 2020)<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Need for monitoring the population regularly (Sivakumar, in litt. 2008), bi-annually, if possible (Manchi 2017). A study of the population genetics of the species is recommended as, despite high population, the species might suffer due to low genetic diversity, which makes the population prone to extinction by a single epidemic (Manchi 2017). Vegetation studies are required to assess the impact of removal of goats on natural plant regeneration and to assess the impact of the rodent population on seed predation/plant regeneration on the island and identify potential mitigation strategies (Shankar Raman &amp; Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt.</em> 2020). The feral cats on the island need to be removed (Manchi 2017), only two are now believed to remain (Rohit Naniwadekar <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;There is a suggestion from the government to establish a second population on another suitable island in the Andamans to secure the species against a serious population decline or natural disaster. This, or indeed the establishment of a captive population requires a full evaluation prior to commencement and must follow globally agreed best practice and guidelines for translocation, conservation breeding and species introduction for conservation.<br/>Develop a long-term species assessment and action plan.<br/><p></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

As the population is small however, it is listed as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","It is found in all habitats, from shoreline to bare lava-fields, open, rocky, scrub country, deciduous forests and mountain peaks. It feeds on a wide variety of sea and landbirds, rats, lizards, iguanas, invertebrates and carrion. It breeds throughout the year. It nests on a stick platform on a prominent lava outflow, rocky outcrop or in a small tree<strong></strong> (Thiollay 1994). It is cooperatively polyandrous, with one female typically mating with two or three males (up to eight males have been recorded), and all males helping in raising the chicks<strong></strong> (Faaborg <em>et al.</em> 1995).<br/><p></p>","The population is currently assessed as stable, although the small population and disjunct distribution renders it   susceptible to stochastic events. The most probable cause of the species's historical decline is persecution by humans<strong></strong> (de Vries 1973), which is now no longer considered a threat (D. Wiedenfeld <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012; Jiménez-Utzcátegui <em>et al</em>. 2019). A low genetic diversity in the small island populations is a potential threat (Bollmer <em>et al. </em>2005; Jiménez-Utzcátegui <em>et al</em>. 2019); this has led to increased parasite loads and vulnerability to disease in certain island populations<strong> </strong>(Whiteman <em>et al. </em>2006). Nevertheless, as the species has never had a large effective population size, this is unlikely to become a major threat to the species now<strong> </strong>(D. Wiedenfeld <em>in litt. </em>2007). Habitat within the range is degraded and lost through agricultural expansion (Jiménez-Utzcátegui <em>et al</em>. 2019). Furthermore, the removal of introduced goats from some islands has led to local population declines, likely as a result of vegetation recovery in the absence of goats and a change in prey availability (T. de Vries <em>in litt.</em> 2000, 2007; Jaramillo <em>et al</em>. 2016; Bierregaard <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>","The population is difficult to measure except in terms of breeding territories. However the breeding system means that the population is larger than the number of territories suggests; for example, the population on Santiago may  number 180 adults in the 50 territories, with a total of c.250  individuals (Faaborg 1984). The most recent overall population estimate is 400-500 mature individuals and 300-400 juveniles (T. de Vries <em>in litt.</em> 2000, 2007).
